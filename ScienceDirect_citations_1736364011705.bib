abstract = {Qifu decoction (QFD) is an ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription for the treatment of heart failure. However, the mechanisms and active constituents of QFD are poorly understood. In this study, multi-matrices metabolomics (serum, urine, and myocardial mitochondria) based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOFMS), were employed for exploring the mechanisms of QFD against heart failure in rat model. Twenty-one, seventeen, and fifteen endogenous metabolite biomarkers associated with heart failure were identified from serum, urine, and myocardial mitochondria datasets, respectively. Fourteen, twelve, and ten of the identified serum, urine, and mitochondria biomarkers were significantly reversed by QFD, respectively. QFD-targeted pathways were involved in TCA cycle, branched chain amino acids metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism. In addition, QFD-derived constituents in serum were fully analyzed by UHPLC-Q-TOFMS and SUS-plot, and 24 QFD-derived components were identified in serum. Then, the correlation analysis between the QFD-reversed serum biomarkers and QFD-derived constituents in serum was employed to dissect the active constituents of QFD. It was found that eight prototypical components and three metabolites were highly correlated with efficacy and could serve as the active constituents of QFD against heart failure. Finally, neoline and calycosin, which highly correlated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation, were selected to validate in Na2S2O4-induced cell model. It was found that neoline and calycosin provided a significant protective effect against Na2S2O4-induced cell death in a low dose-dependent manner and increased the expressions of the pathway-related protein CPT1B and BCAT2 in the cell model. In conclusions, these findings provided light on the mechanisms and active constituents of QFD against heart failure. Neoline and calycosin could be selected as potential quality-markers of QFD against heart failure.}

Based on the analysis of the differences between the reuse-oriented redesign and the traditional new product design or the redesign based on reverse engineering, a novel reuse-oriented redesign method of used products based on axiomatic design theory and QFD (Quality function deployment) is presented to standardize and optimize the redesign process. More added-value locked into the used products during manufacturing can be reused if the remanufacturing process is designed from the view of axiomatic design. In addition, the process of conceptual redesign is analysed in detail, such as the process of function feature planning based on QFD, structure redesign, and so on. Finally, in order to verify its feasibility and validity, the proposed method is applied to machine tool remanufacturing and it is proved that redesigned products can obtain the similar performance with new designed products.}

Quality function deployment (QFD) is used as a powerful tool for improving product design and quality, and procuring a customer-driven quality system. In this paper, an integrated framework based on fuzzy-QFD and a fuzzy optimization model is proposed to determine the product technical requirements (PTRs) to be considered in designing a product. The coefficients of the objective function are obtained from a fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) approach. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is also used in the proposed framework. An application in a Turkish Company producing PVC window and door systems is presented to illustrate the proposed framework.}

Since the inception of QFD in Japan in the early 1970s, it has met with varying degrees of success. This paper first reviews the literature and describes the EHOQ, which is a mature arrangement of QFD. Other related deployment techniques are examined, and a new concept called concurrent function deployment (CFD) is described. CFD is based on parallel deployment of several lifecycle “value plans” in addition to the “quality plan” used in QFD. CFD thus gives rise to integrated templates, called house of values (HOV), which are compared to EHOQ templates. The differences and similarities between QFD and CFD are discussed.}

The importance of evaluating criteria is prioritized with respect to the degree of achieving the stakeholder requirements using fuzzy AHP. Based on the ranked criteria, alternative 3PLs are evaluated and compared with each other using fuzzy AHP again to make an optimal selection. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a Hong Kong based enterprise that supplies hard disk components. The proposed integrated approach outperforms the existing approaches because the outsourcing strategy and 3PLs selection are derived from the corporate/business strategy.}

In the post-pandemic era, the essential role of these respirators in protecting against airborne hazards and infectious agents persists. Addressing the need for standardized design and manufacturing processes, this research proposes a three-phased integrated decision-making framework. Firstly, text-mining algorithms analyze online consumer reviews to identify critical characteristics of surgical N95 respirators. Subsequently, a spherical-fuzzy-based quality function deployment assesses manufacturing capabilities in alignment with consumer requirements. The final phase utilizes Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming to optimize utility and select the most effective design, considering both technical specifications and consumer needs. The proposed framework is validated through a case study, revealing technical characteristics crucial for organizations in product development. The findings not only offer insights into the technical aspects of N95 respirators but also recommend essential product characteristic tests during manufacturing and certification. This information is vital for educating consumers and guiding companies in the effective use and development of Surgical N95 respirators in the post-pandemic landscape, addressing the challenges posed by inferior and counterfeit products.}

To alleviate the adverse impact on the environment, natural resources, health and comfort of inhabitants, sustainable principles have been incorporated into the design, construction, decoration, operation, and maintenance of buildings. Among all these endeavors, sustainable building material selection is diffusely regarded as the simplest and most essential way of achieving sustainability. To this end, this paper develops a novel hybrid multi-criteria group decision making model for sustainable building material selection under uncertainty. The information representation construction used for alternative-criteria assessments in this model is a brand-new notion called Basic Uncertain Linguistic Information, which is capable of handling the qualitative performance estimates as well as its partial reliability. Multiple stakeholders are usually responsible for sustainable building material selection, and therefore, the fact that multiple perspectives are involved in the collective decision-making efforts is revealed by a Consensus Reaching Process to reach a decision reflecting at least a majority-based agreement among them. The Quality Function Deployment-based approach to determining comprehensive importance ratings of assessment criteria is further proposed to take into account diversifying sustainable building material requirements from different stakeholders. Subsequently, the ELECTRE III methodology, which models the heterogeneity and non-compensation among assessment criteria as well as their qualitative essence, is introduced to determine the ultimate priorities of alternative sustainable building materials. Finally, sensitive and comparative analyses are performed to verify the advantages of the proposed model in comparison with several existing methodologies.}

The research addresses three pivotal questions: (1) Does digitalization authentically ensure sustainability in agriculture? (2) What are the paramount sustainability requirements for digitalization in agriculture? (3) Can SA systems be viably designed to concurrently fulfill digital and sustainable requisites? Employing a two-stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) framework with the interval-valued 2-Tuple linguistic (IV-2-TL) model, the methodology offers a nuanced analysis of relationships between sustainability-digitalization and SA. Validation through a Turkey-based case study demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in identifying digital solutions for sustainability needs and prioritizing SA design requirements. This study contributes significantly in three key ways. Firstly, the IV-2-TL-QFD method provides a valuable decision-making framework to assess digitalization-sustainability-SA interconnections ensuring optimal SA design. Secondly, it identifies vital digitalization requirements for addressing sustainability challenges in the QFD framework. Third, a 10-step roadmap guides the transition to SA, portraying digitalization as instrumental in achieving broader sustainability. This study provides profound insights and tools, bridging the gap between digitalization and sustainable agriculture for a more resilient and environmentally responsible future in food production.}

However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that by improving the management and performance of the region's utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up in most economies of the region to finance the investments needed. These resources represent what is known as the quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) associated with the management of the electricity sector in policy discussions. The paper presents the first evaluation of its size and composition in 14 economies of the region. Based on 2013 data, the average QFD is estimated at 4.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). It is lower than 3% for only four economies. For most, its main driver is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.3% of GDP. Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6% of GDP. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.5 and 0.2% of GDP.}

Two examples of mechanical robots are analyzed by using this method and critical failure modes are determined for each robot. Corrective actions are proposed for critical items to modify robots reliability and reduce their risks. Finally by using QFD, quality of these robots is improved according to the customers’ requirements.

The improvement of sustainability management and performance for a company is an opportunity for a firm’s development and growth rather than a threat. Unlike large companies, it can be more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable enterprises, as shortage of resources is a common feature for most SMEs. Therefore, SMEs should effectively utilize their limited resources and prioritize their performance factors in terms of a balanced scorecard (BSC) approach in elaborating their sustainability development. In order to select important elements in the wide range of sustainability indicators suggested in the literature and launch performance factors for improving the sustainability of manufacturing SMEs, this research utilizes quality function deployment (QFD) approach as the basic structure, in which it combines with fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), modified fuzzy extent analytic hierarchy process (FEAHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to prioritize the performance factors.

Although first used by the Japanese, experiences from “Western” companies support the results of better products and production planning. Key factor for success is the Cross Functional Management approach.}

abstract = {Intense competition and sophisticated customer needs have resulted in the development of more complex products with a shorter lead time to market. One of the key factors in product development concerns the understanding and management of complex relationships between customers’ needs and technical requirements. Usually these complex relationships are expressed using imprecise descriptions in the form of natural linguistic terms. Frequently, quality function deployment (QFD) is employed to manage design information and assist decision-making in human centered product development. This work proposes a rough set based QFD approach to manage the aforementioned imprecise design information in product development. A novel concept known as rough number∗, which is derived from the basic notions of rough sets, is proposed to manage the imprecise design information in QFD analysis. A case study on a bicycle design is used to illustrate the approach proposed. The result shows that the new approach proposed can effectively manage the imprecise design information and facilitate decision-making in product development.}

Environment change, competitiveness and attitude of customers have convinced managers to have a strategic program. In strategic programming SWOT analysis is a useful method that can be used for analyzing strengths and weaknesses within the organization and opportunities and threats from outside of the organization. Although this method is very practical there are some problems in using it. For example there is no tool to determine the importance of factors and this is mostly done by personal preferences. In this paper weight of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are calculated by Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment and proper strategies for the organization are achieved by HOQ (House of Quality). Hence the customer requirements are important for the strategic planners in this approach the relations between the customer requirements and relations at the top of HOQ are numerically calculated and have impact on internal and external factors of the organization. Because of uncertainty in the decision making factors the calculations are done in a fuzzy environment. At the end this approach is applied in Petrokaran factory as a numerical case study.}

The weights obtained for various process characteristics are utilized to estimate an overall score for each of the NTM processes. Finally, if some of the NTM processes satisfy certain critical criteria, they are again compared with each other on the basis of their overall scores and the process having the maximum score is selected as the optimal choice.}

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) has been a widely-acknowledged tool for translating customer requirements into quality product characteristics based on which product development strategies and focus areas are identified. However, the QFD method considers the correlation and effect between development parameters, but it is not directly implemented in the importance ranking of development actions. Therefore, the cross-relationships between development parameters and their impact on customer requirement satisfaction are often neglected. The primary objective of this study is to make decision-making more reliable by improving QFD with methods that optimize the selection of development parameters even under capacity or cost constraints and directly implement cross-relationships between development parameters and support the identification of interactions visually. Therefore, QFD is accessed from two approaches that proved efficient in operations research. 1) QFD is formulated as a network flow problem with two objectives: maximizing the benefits of satisfying customer needs using linear optimization or minimizing the total cost of actions while still meeting customer requirements using assignment of minimum cost flow approach. 2) QFD is represented as a hypergraph, which allows efficient representation of the interactions of the relationship and correlation matrix and the determination of essential factors based on centrality metrics. The applicability of the methods is demonstrated through an application study in developing a sustainable design of customer electronic products and highlights the improvements' contribution to different development strategies, such as linear optimization performed the best in maximizing customer requirements' satisfaction, assignment as minimum cost flow approach minimized the total cost, while the hypergraph-based representation identified the indirect interactions of development parameters and customer requirements.}

In contrast to the traditional cascading deployment, members from marketing, design, and manufacturing teams concurrently derive the requirements from three different aspects. The charts driven by the deployment results produce design concepts of high feasibility through query by function, specification, and module of a product. They are presented in 3D assembly for better visual stimuli rather than clutter of 2D sketches. A computer-aided conceptual design system is implemented to realize the proposed ideas with computer mice as an example product. A design experiment is conducted to compare the quantity and quality of the concepts generated with and without the aid of the system. The results show that it promotes quick generation of innovative concepts while maintaining their manufacturability.}

Most refurbishment work, however, involves a high level of risk, uncertainty, and coordination, which are likely to cause asymmetric information between contractors and residents in a refurbishment process. Most private refurbishment contractor selections are usually based on word-of-mouth referrals that lack a systematic and objective assessment method. This study proposes a hybrid approach combining fuzzy set theory and quality function deployment (QFD) to establish a housing refurbishment contractor selection model. With this model, residents can select an optimal refurbishment contractor according to requirements. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, a known multiple criteria decision-making method, PROMETHEE, is applied to compare the results of contractor selections. The result reveals that the proposed hybrid fuzzy-QFD approach can be expected to be successful and has potential for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems.}

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the policies of Made in China 2025, focusing on the relationships between competitive capabilities and action plans in manufacturing. We analyze how the action plans contribute to capability improvement, utilizing a strategy formulation model associated with the forward process and feedback process. A new method, which we called the Reverse Quality Function Deployment, is proposed to complete the analysis of the feedback process. The results show that different competitive capabilities have been given different priorities in the policies. We find that there are some gaps when comparing our results to the targets of Made in China 2025. How to close the gaps was analyzed with the application of the new method. Several suggestions on the implementation of Made in China 2025 are proposed, which can also be applied to the manufacturing strategy decisions in other developing countries.}

Qifu decoction (QFD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) composed of Astragali Radix (HuangQi) and Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia (Fuzi), which can alleviate doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). However, its protective mechanism remains obscured.
Aim of the study
The present study aimed to uncover the cardioprotective mechanism and the synergistic effect of QFD against DIC in mice.
Materials and methods
The cardioprotective activity of QFD against DIC was assessed by electrocardiogram, serum biochemical assays and histopathology. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach was conducted to elucidate the preventive mechanisms of QFD, HuangQi decoction (HQD), and Fuzi decoction (FZD) against DIC. QFD, HQD, FZD-targeted metabolic pathways were identified and compared to investigate the synergistic mechanism of QFD by computational systems analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was further employed to validate the key metabolic pathways at the level of the gene.
Results
The electrocardiogram combined with the biochemical analysis and histopathology showed that the protection effects were sorted as QFD > HQD ≈ FZD. A total of 41 metabolites contributing to DIC were identified in the mice serum, among which 32, 12 and 10 metabolites were significantly reverted by QFD, HQD and FZD, respectively. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that DOX perturbed 12 metabolic pathways, and QFD, HQD, and FZD-treated groups could significantly reverse 12, 7 and 6 metabolic pathways of these 12 metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathway and qRT-PCR revealed that QFD could protect DIC mainly by regulating energy metabolism, amino acids metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, and HQD and FZD mutually reinforced each other.
Conclusion
These evidences revealed that QFD was a promising drug candidate for DIC by maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Meanwhile, this work provided a useful approach for evaluating the efficacy and the synergistic effects of TCMs against cardiomyopathy.}

To improve the BV satisfaction and accuracy of supplier evaluation results and to offer manufacturers effective decision-support in selecting suppliers that create BV, a data-driven supplier decision-making method comprising a two-stage model is proposed under BV orientation. In the first stage, the supplier relationship model is developed to elicit the autocorrelation importance based on MCN theory and supplier data. In the second stage, the supplier autocorrelation importance and industrial value chain data are integrated into the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) process to transform BV demands into value activities, and further into suppliers, with the purpose of calculating the importance of each supplier. Finally, the applicability and superiority of this method are illustrated by carrying out a case study using the real data collected from the air-conditioning industrial value chain. The proposed method takes into account the essence of MCN relationships among suppliers, making assessment results more accurate and realistic. It not only provides manufacturers with an effective decision-making tool to select suppliers for co-creating BV, and but also contributes to an innovative method for data-driven supplier evaluation of CPIVC.}

This approach aims to determine key process resources with estimation of manufacturing cost, taking into account the risk cost associated to the process plan. It can serve as a useful methodology to support the decision making during the initial planning stage of the product development cycle. Quality function deployment (QFD) method is used to select the process alternatives by incorporating a capability function for process elements called a composite process capability index (CCP). The quality characteristics and the process elements in QFD method have been taken as input to complete process failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) table. To estimate manufacturing cost, the proposed approach deploys activity-based costing (ABC) method. Then, an extended technique of classical FMEA method is employed to estimate the cost of risks associated to the studied process plan, this technique is called cost-based FMEA. For each resource combination, the output data is gathered in a selection table that helps for detailed process planning in order to improve product quality/cost ratio.

Environmental performance evaluation (EPE) is an essential part of an EMS. However, previous studies on EPE indicate that existing lists of indicators little insight into how indicators are modified to more accurately assess environmental performance. In this paper, a way is proposed to identify and define specific environmental performance indicators on a case-by-case basis, which consists of five steps: (1) describing environmental requirements; (2) determining favourable outcomes corresponding to the requirements; (3) identifying required activities or issues to achieve the outcomes; (4) searching for proper measures of the activities or issues; and (5) generating a list of key indicators. Based on these steps, a quality function deployment (QFD) approach is developed to determine key indicators and evaluate environmental performance. To handle uncertainties in QFD, the decision makers’ evaluations are quantified through rough numbers using the concept of rough sets. The outputs of the proposed approach are different environmental performance indices. Using these indices, decision makers can easily determine whether an improved performance has been achieved through an EMS. The proposed approach is transparent and promising for use as a unified tool for EPE. An application of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example.}

abstract = {As an efficient customer-oriented product design tool for converting customer requirements (CRs) into quality characteristics (QCs) of a product, quality function deployment (QFD) is applied to the selection of new product design schemes. However, the effective implementation of QFD is hampered by two fundamental challenges: (a) biases in people’s understanding of customer satisfaction and (b) the ambiguously assessed relationship between CRs and QCs because of the inherent uncertainty in human judgment. Therefore, this paper provides a p-ary Choquet-based multicriteria decision-making model to rank new product design schemes considering customer psychological and risk attitudes. The selection of a new product design scheme is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the p-ary Choquet integral converts the objective technical parameters of a new product design scheme into utility, which is the subjective feeling from the perspective of two-factor theory. Then, the integration of 2-additive measures and the Choquet integral is used to account for the redundancy and complementary effects among customer requirements. Finally, a case study of an electric vehicle manufacturing company and a comparison analysis are presented to illustrate the validity of our proposal. The p-ary Choquet-based multicriteria decision-making model realizes customer-oriented product design scheme selection by systematically analyzing customer preferences and bridging the gap between products that are emotionally recognized by customers and those that exhibit excellent performance in terms of functionality and cost.}

The proposed methodology allows for considering the impacts of inner dependence among supplier assessment criteria through constructing a house of quality (HOQ). The lower and upper bounds of the weights of supplier assessment criteria are identified by adopting fuzzy weighted average (FWA) method that enables the fusion of imprecise and subjective information expressed as linguistic variables. An imprecise DEA methodology is implemented for supplier selection, which employs the weights of supplier assessment criteria computed by FWA utilizing the data from the HOQ and the supplier ratings with respect to supplier assessment criteria.

However, most BSP studies focus only on the socio-economic characteristics of the users, bike-sharing patterns, and impacts that influence bike-sharing demand. This study increases the knowledge on BSPs by presenting a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach that is based on multi-phase quality function deployment. This approach covers the performance evaluation of smart BSPs allowing for customer voices under uncertain conditions. This method combines the fuzzy best-worst method (BWM), fuzzy maximizing deviation method (MDM), and fuzzy multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA). It uses fuzzy BWM to determine priorities of customer requirements and company strategies and to obtain subjective importance coefficients of criteria. Fuzzy MDM is used to derive objective importance coefficients of criteria and fuzzy MULTIMOORA is used to rank alternatives in terms of each criterion. An empirical case in Changsha, which is one of the pilot areas for comprehensively supporting the reform for an environment-friendly and resource-conserving society ("two-oriented society") in China, is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed framework. Results can help enterprises and organizations improve their performance and provide high-quality products and services for customers.}

However, the evolution of the decision-making environment has made the quantification within the traditional QFD operation could hardly able to meet the demanded efficiency as well as the accuracy of the generated results. To cope with the problem, an enhanced large-scale group decision-making method that integrates proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PHFLTSs) and the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is put forward by this study to determine the ranking priority of ECs in doing QFD. To facilitate QFD team members carry out an easier and more accurate evaluation, they would use comparative linguistic expressions in making judgments, and the comparative linguistic expressions are subsequently transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). The obtained HFLTSs are transformed into PHFLTSs based on the statistical method under a group decision-making environment for preventing information loss, and, at the same time, improving calculation accuracy. Taking decision-makers’ heterogeneity and risk attitudes into consideration, the CPT method is adopted and extended under the PHFL environment to prioritize the ECs in QFD operation. To illustrate how the proposed large-scale group decision-making-based QFD method is to be applied, a case study about solar photovoltaic cell development is presented. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed QFD method.}

With automatic dishwashers entering the Chinese market, manufacturers can use QFD to develop products that meet the unique Chinese customer requirements and explore the Chinese market. To help manufacturers maximize profits by developing automatic dishwashers to China’s market situation and competitive environment, this paper proposes an improved QFD model considering competitive learning and cost analysis based on market information analysis with Product Life Cycle (PLC) theory. On the one hand, the improved QFD model determines the life cycle stage of the product by analyzing the characteristics of the market. The improvement rate of customer requirements (CRs) determined by competitive learning in different stages has different influence on the importance weights of CRs, so that the new products developed based on design requirements (DRs) converted from CRs can better adapt to the current market environment. On the other hand, the cost strategy will also change according to different PLC stages. In cost analysis, different cost criteria weights will be determined in different life cycle stages to deal with product development risks in different market environments and help enterprises achieve better sustainable development. Finally, we take Chinese HE company’s automatic-dishwasher design as an example to show the specific application of the proposed model. The proposed model identifies the important DRs and their relative importance ranking for the product development. Comparison with existing QFD models shows the ranking obtained through the model is better integrated with market information, enabling the development of products that are better suited to the market, and helping companies to achieve sustainable development.}

Firstly, this paper extracts CRs from online reviews on e-commerce platforms, and the initial HOQs can be constructed. Then a bilateral negotiation GDM method based on SNA is carried out to generate a consensus-based HOQ, and therefore the final priorities of DRs can be obtained.

abstract = {Purpose
Sustainable development goals and the climate change agenda are becoming widely promoted topics of research for the 21st century. The role of cities is increasingly recognised as central to investigating these topics. Yet, the field of informal sector entrepreneurship which so many urban entrepreneurs in developing countries depend upon is seldom considered. To redress this imbalance, this study aims to develop a decision model in accordance with institutional theory (IT) and resource dependency theory (RDT) for city managers to deploy. The model identifies and prioritises optimal strategies to address the three areas of sustainability requirements environment society and economy within the study context of Bangladesh.
Design/methodology/approach
This study used a mixed methods research design. In the qualitative part, the authors identified the three areas of sustainability requirements (i.e. environment, society and economy) and their corresponding strategies involving the informal sector that operates within the urban environment. In the quantitative part, the authors applied fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) integrated with the 0-1 non-linear optimisation technique to identify optimal strategies.
Findings
The findings show that strategies such as legitimate frameworks, waste management, allocation of urban public space and training programs contribute in important ways to the three areas of sustainability requirements.
Practical implications
The proposed decision model will assist policy-makers and city managers to prioritise sustainability requirements and implement optimal strategies to address those requirements.
Originality/value
Through the integration of IT and RDT, the decision model developed in this study is unique in its application to urban-based informal entrepreneurship in the context of developing countries. The effective application of the fuzzy QFD approach and the optimisation model in the context of urban-based informal entrepreneurship also offers unique contributions to the field of study.}

Given its simplicity and visibility, the QFD has been broadly utilized in a variety of industries for product or service planning. However, traditional QFD method assumes that the behavior of domain experts is completely rational, and is only suitable for product development problems with a small number of experts. In this paper, we aim to develop a new large group QFD approach based on an extended TODIM (Portuguese acronym for interactive multi-criteria decision making) method under interval type-2 fuzzy context. The interval type-2 fuzzy sets are utilized to describe the imprecise and uncertain correlation assessment information between customer requirements and engineering characteristics. The normal TODIM is modified and used to derive the priority of engineering characteristics considering the psychological factors of experts. Also, an entropy weighting method was adopted to derive the weights of customer requirements objectively. Finally, we provide an electric vehicle product development case and perform a comparison analysis with previous methods to reveal the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed large group QFD approach.}

To this end, this study integrates an optimization-based consensus reaching process into QFD for dealing with conflicting customer opinions, where customer opinions are modeled with incomplete linguistic distribution assessments. First, a consistency-driven optimization model is designed to convert incomplete linguistic distribution assessments into complete linguistic distribution assessments by maximizing the consistency index of complete linguistic distribution assessments. Then, consensus reaching process based on a two-stage-based consensus model is developed to yield the consensual collective linguistic distribution assessments, which are further utilized to derive the consensual importance ratings of CRs. The first stage of the consensus model aims to minimize the adjustment between the original linguistic distribution assessments and the adjusted linguistic distribution assessments, and the second stage aims to minimize the symbolic distance between the original linguistic distribution assessments and the adjusted linguistic distribution assessments. Finally, a case study of product development for EVCARD in China, a sensitivity analysis, and a comparative analysis are presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposal.}

Since picture fuzzy set (PFS) which is an extension of IFS, has been proved more ideal than fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy set in modeling of fuzziness and uncertainty in real life problem of decision making, we have integrated QFD with PFS to propose a multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) method. Present study contributes a MCGDM method that uses prominent characteristic of QFD in the integration of heterogeneous preferences of decision makers by splitting them into groups of users and analysts. Positive, negative and no correlations among engineering criteria without normalization in QFD is used in proposed MCGDM method to obtain more precise overall relationship matrix and hence final ranking of alternatives. Feasibility and suitability of proposed MCGDM method is verified by using it on a real case study of ranking of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter in which users are taken as decision makers.}

abstract = {This article suggests a new method that transfers the house of quality (HOQ) approach typical of quality function deployment (QFD) problems to the supplier selection process. To test its efficacy, the method is applied to a supplier selection process for a medium-to-large industry that manufactures complete clutch couplings. The study starts by identifying the features that the purchased product should have (internal variables “WHAT”) in order to satisfy the company's needs, then it seeks to establish the relevant supplier assessment criteria (external variables “HOW”) in order to come up with a final ranking based on the fuzzy suitability index (FSI). The whole procedure was implemented using fuzzy numbers; the application of a fuzzy algorithm allowed the company to define by means of linguistic variables the relative importance of the “WHAT”, the “HOW”–“WHAT” correlation scores, the resulting weights of the “HOW” and the impact of each potential supplier. Special attention is paid to the various subjective assessments in the HOQ process, and symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers are suggested to capture the vagueness in people's verbal assessments.}

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is a powerful customer-driven quality management tool that improves product quality by translating customer requirements (CRs) into design requirements (DRs) of a product. It is essential in QFD to obtain the importance ratings of DRs from the importance ratings of CRs and the relationship between CRs and DRs. However, two basic challenges hinder the effective implementation of QFD: (i) vague assessments of the relationship between CRs and DRs due to the inherent uncertainty in human judgement; and (ii) diverse importance ratings of DRs owing to the heterogeneity of the QFD team members. To this end, this study provides a consensus-based QFD to derive the consensual importance ratings of DRs, where linguistic distributions are used by the QFD team to express their assessments of the relationship between CRs and DRs. In the consensus-based QFD, a minimum–maximum adjustment consensus model is presented to assist the QFD team in deriving a consensual assessment regarding the relationship between CRs and DRs. This model is designed by minimizing the maximum adjustment between the original and the adjusted linguistic distribution assessments. Moreover, some desirable properties of the minimum–maximum adjustment consensus model are investigated. Finally, a case study, a detailed sensitivity analysis, and a comparison analysis are presented to illustrate the validity of our proposal.}

Rattan is a tropical vine widely used in the furniture industry and predominantly found in wooded areas such as Indonesia. This research combines market research, morphology, ergonomic study, concept selection, QFD, HoQ, stiffness test, and prototype review. The QFD method was chosen in this study due to its excellence in connecting consumer desires with the product development process. Data of respondents consist of 51 % of respondents were male, 49 % were female, 88 % were aged between 18 and 34 years old, and 10 % were aged between 35 and 54 years old. The approach of 6 stages of product design as the primary framework for developing our product such as: planning, concept development (concept screening, product morphology, concept selection), system-level design, detailed design, testing, refinement and launching. Based on the calculations using the HOQ, it is identified that the primary focus in designing the rattan-based orthopaedic seating, lies in the orthopaedic design that provides maximum comfort for the spine. The comparison results indicate that the stiffness level of rattan weaving is nearly like latex, with a similarity percentage of 89 %. Data analysis using the QFD method indicates that the primary priority aspect is the orthopaedic design, followed by the selection of quality materials, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and appealing design aspects. Rattan's superior air circulation provides comfort by preventing excessive heat accumulation, excellence in strength and durability, ensuring ease of lightweight modelling, and providing more sustainable material.}

As an interactive system, identifying essential design requirements (DRs) based on user requirements (URs) during the conceptual design phase of MCS is challenging as it directly affects the cost of subsequent optimization design and user experimentation, as well as user experience. Therefore, we propose a quality function deployment (QFD) method based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in an interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) environment to establish a mapping relationship between URs and DRs and identify human-centered DRs to guide the conceptual design process of MCS. Firstly, we summarized the URs for MCS design and calculated their weights using IVSF based analytical hierarchy process (IVSF-AHP). Afterward, we determined DRs based on URs and established the UR-DR relationship in the house of quality of QFD. Next, we integrate the VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method in the IVSF environment into QFD to determine the priority of DRs. The results indicate that system functional design, scene layout design, compatibility design, and multi-user collaborative optimization design are important DRs for designing MCS and should be carefully considered. We validated the applicability of this method through an urban planning MCS design example and provided a conceptual design case including functional blueprints. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis demonstrate the flexibility and reliability of the proposed method.}

Considering the uncertainty within a QFD, single valued neutrosophic number (SVNN) is introduced to capture both indeterminacy and inconsistency hidden in quantitive votes and qualitative judgments of stakeholders and experts. With unknown weight assignments, two maximum deviation models are constructed to obtain the priority of SRs and Shapley weights of experts. An SVNN-enabled grey relational analysis is extended to identify the interdependence priority of engineer characterizers (ECs). Due to the interactions among components such as experts in a group or ECs in QFD, two information aggregation tools under neutrosophic environments are presented based on fuzzy integral delineating the positive or negative effect. Built on these, we propose an integrated neutrosophic approach composed of a transformation module, weight module, integration module and QFD analysis module to support the outsourcing decision. Finally, an illustration example is used to confirm the practicality of the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with multiple views have been conducted to show the flexibility and superiority of the given decision.}

However, the prioritization results in the conventional QFD may be misleading since it does not consider the uncertainty of input information. This paper develops two robustness indices and proposes the notion of robust prioritization that ensures the EC prioritization to be robust against the uncertainty. The robustness indices consider robustness from two perspectives, namely, the absolute ranking of ECs and the priority relationship among ECs. Based on the two indices, robust prioritization seeks to identify a set of ECs or a priority relationship among ECs in such a way that the result of robust prioritization is stable despite the uncertainty. Finally, the proposed robustness indices and robust prioritization are demonstrated in a case study conducted on the ADSL-based high-speed internet service.}

The method combines the fuzzy QFD technique for weighting the criteria with a procedure for assessing the difficulty to obtain information to evaluate the suppliers on each criterion. The choice and weighting of the criteria derive from a systematic procedure based on the use of linguistic terms to judge the importance of the related requirements and the intensity of the relationship between requirements and criteria. In the final step, the proposed method classifies the criteria into four groups (priority, critical, complementary and costly) so as to guide the final choice of criteria. The method was implemented in Excel and applied to a pilot case in an automotive company, which classified the criteria into groups so as to guide the decision in the final selection. Competitive price, delivery in full on time, product conformance and quality certification were categorized into the priority group meaning that they should be used in the supplier selection process. On the other hand, commitment to cost reduction, financial situation, responsiveness to demand change, commitment to quality improvement and potential for collaboration were classified as critical, meaning that they are important but they require a bigger effort of data collection. The results of the application were considered by the decision makers as consistent and aligned with the strategic competitive priorities of the supply chain. Differently from other studies, the type of item as well as the type of supply chain was formally considered in the determination of the initial list of requirements and criteria. Moreover, final selection of the set of criteria is also dependent on the linguistic evaluation of the degree of difficulty of data collection.}

Nevertheless, the elicitation of the customer needs and expectations through the assessment of the mutual interactions between the product’s and the service’s elements has been scarcely addressed. To accomplish this, the paper proposes a methodology based on the analysis of the market demand and customer requirements by means of the Quality Function Deployment for Product Service System (QFDforPSS) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods. To verify the proposed methodology, it was applied to a case study in the medical devices sector, in collaboration with a provider of medical imaging equipment. Practical results showed that the proposed methodology allowed engineers to make the assessment of the PSS requirements comparable and homogenous, providing an accurate evaluation of their mutual interactions, as well as of those factors that are hidden to the customers and have an indirect effect on its satisfaction. Although the proposed approach needs to be validated through further studies in different contexts, it can be valuable for theory development and also for practitioners in the PSS field.}

Most attention in literature relates to the benefits of QFD or to the more or less “technical” aspects of the method. Mostly comments on implementation and use are mentioned quite summarily. QFD in fact is a method of continuous product improvement, emphasising the impact of organisational learning on innovation. It must not be seen as just an “ad hoc” tool for the development of a particular product neither will it lead to “perfect” products. QFD has to become part of a company's culture. From that perspective it should belong to the management process. Because of that “cultural change” we will encounter quite specific implementation problems. Implementation problems can be categorised into three groups: methodological problems, organisational problems and problems concerning product policy. Besides the problem of information gathering, the biggest problems are of an organisational nature. Characteristics of western management can limit the effectiveness of the technique. Special attention must be paid to product policy and cross-functional project approach to make this tool a valuable technological and organisational aid for innovation projects. Based on document and case studies from the USA and the Netherlands we will reflect upon differences between the Japanese and “Western” practices and resulting implementation problems.}

Enhancing the quality of real estate products in the design phase may raise competitive advantage in the real estate market. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is an effective tool to improve the product quality and enhance competitive advantages in the market. The aim of this paper is to explore the applicability of QFD approach in enhancing the quality of a middle-grade apartment in the design phase. The seven-step procedure was used to develop the fuzzy-QFD system in the design phase of apartment projects. The study used a current apartment project as a case study to validate the approach. The customer’s satisfaction and dissatisfaction on the current design was considered to determine design features a quality apartment meeting the customers’ desires. The fuzzy numbers were used to rate the importance weightings of each customer requirement. The findings indicates that the balcony connected to the living room, the laundry with enough space for hanging the washing, and increasing the area of windows for natural lighting and ventilation are major customer desires influencing on their decisions to purchase an apartment in Vietnam. The proposed design solutions for enhancing the quality of the apartment can be used as a guide to focus on what the customer desires throughout the design phase. The results of this paper suggested that QFD can help investors, real estate companies and consultants to produce quality apartments at the design phase. Since Korea has emerged as the first largest foreign investor in Vietnam, the customer’s requirements, technical solutions, and proposed design solutions may be valuable lessons for Korean investors, who would like to invest in real estate projects in Vietnam.}

In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making approach that makes use of the quality function deployment (QFD) concept is developed for supplier selection process. The proposed methodology initially identifies the features that the purchased product should possess in order to satisfy the company’s needs, and then it seeks to establish the relevant supplier assessment criteria. Moreover, the proposed algorithm enables to consider the impacts of inner dependence among supplier assessment criteria. The upper and the lower bounds of the weights of supplier assessment criteria and ratings of suppliers are computed by using the fuzzy weighted average (FWA) method. The FWA method allows for the fusion of imprecise and subjective information expressed as linguistic variables or fuzzy numbers. The method produces less imprecise and more realistic overall desirability levels, and thus it rectifies the problem of loss of information. A fuzzy number ranking method that is based on area measurement is used to obtain the final ranking of suppliers. The computational procedure of the proposed framework is illustrated through a supplier selection problem reported in an earlier study.}

The method has been tested on different samples of extra virgin olive oil to verify its suitability. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of such multi-criterion technique not only for the design and development of new products that meet customers’ requirements, but also for testing the quality of existing ones. The main innovation of the method, consists in the application of the fuzzy logic to address the issue, common in many decisional techniques, of dealing with data deriving from subjective verbally expressed evaluations that cannot be treated with mathematical models. The objective of this work was to test the combined assessment technique based on quality function deployment and fuzzy logic method for determining which characteristics of extra virgin olive oil influence most of the acceptance of the consumers toward the product. The relationship between consumer expectations, defined by a market survey, and main attributes of the examined products were assessed by means of the House of Quality (HOQ). The results obtained allowed to classify the quality of different brands of olive oil with respect to customer preferences.}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory condition primarily characterized by airway obstruction. It’s necessary to examine the therapeutic effect of QFD in the treatment of COPD and elucidate its potential effective components, targets, and pathways. This study utilized UHPLC coupled with HRMS to identify the chemical constituents of QFD, resulting in the qualitative analysis of 68 compounds. Network pharmacology predicted 30 gene targets, including IL6, AKT1, and EGFR, and revealed 45 compounds, including ruscogenin, schisandrin A, and esculetin that may contribute to its therapeutic effects on COPD. Subsequently, an elastase-induced COPD mouse model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of QFD. The effects of QFD were assessed through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on lung tissues. Transcriptomic analysis indicating QFD treatment of COPD primarily acted on the IL-17 signaling pathway, which was consistent with the network pharmacology results. Furthermore, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot demonstrated reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of TRAF3IP2, TRAF6, IL17, and TNFα. These findings confirmed that QFD effectively reduced inflammation, likely by down-regulating the IL-17 signaling pathway, thereby treating COPD.}

Deriving the rating order of technical attributes from input variables is a crucial step in applying QFD. When the relative weights of customer requirements and the relationship measures between customer requirements and technical attributes are expressed as fuzzy numbers, calculating the importance of each technical attribute falls into the category of fuzzy weighted average, in which the derived membership function of the fuzzy importance of each technical attribute is not explicitly known. Thus, most ranking methods are not suitable under these circumstances. A method is proposed in this paper using fuzzy weighted average method in the fuzzy expected value operator in order to rank technical attributes in fuzzy QFD. An example of a flexible manufacturing system design is cited to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach.}

In the literature, a lot of QFD approaches have been proposed to overcome the deficiencies and enhance the performance of the traditional QFD method. However, there are several issues deserving further investigation for improving QFD: majority of the existing methods describe experts’ opinions with single linguistic terms directly, which may produce the loss of information; most of the improved QFD methods cannot take the consensus levels among experts into account. In this study, we develop a new integrated QFD approach based on the interval 2-tuple Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic sets (I2PFLSs), the social network consensus reaching (SNCR) model, and an extended combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method. There are three main contributions of the presented study: First, the correlation assessments between CRs and ECs given by experts are handled with the I2PFLSs. Second, the SNCR with minimum adjustment distance is employed to coordinate experts’ conflict correlation assessments by considering their trust relationships. Third, an extended CoCoSo method is employed to determine the importance ranking of ECs within the interval 2-tuple Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic environment. Finally, we present an electric vehicle product development case to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed QFD approach. The results show that the new QFD can express experts’ fuzzy and uncertain linguistic assessment information flexibly, deal with experts’ consensus in correlation assessment process, and yield more precise importance ranking of ECs for product improvement.}

This paper discusses the implementation of the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model to evaluate the service quality of the Two-Wheeler Service Center. The case study is carried out at a two-wheeler service station located in one of the cities located in central India. The customer survey was carried out and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to prioritize the needs of customers and then it is used to build the QFD model. The details of the existing technical capabilities of the working processes such as service delivery, service characteristics requirements, etc, are studied and the technical requirements are identified. A survey was conducted in competitive firms through which competitive performance ratings are calculated. The information is then fed into the house of quality (HOQ), by which Customer requirements are converted to technical requirements and the QFD house is built. This QFD house gives the framework to the management to streamline and plan their existing processes and continuously improve the service quality of the service center to survive and grow in the market.}

This process involves evaluating a broad range of objective and subjective requirements based on multiple technical criteria. Despite its importance, current literature lacks a structured methodology for assisting designers in the selection process of the bridge structural system. Therefore, this research aims to develop a selection model to facilitate the decision-making process, helping evaluate different bridge structural systems during the conceptual design phase. The primary goal is to choose the most optimal design that aligns with both the client’s needs and technical specifications. The proposed methodology begins by identifying client needs and finding their relative importance using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) questionnaire, followed by determining the technical requirements in bridge conceptual design. A Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model is developed to evaluate bridge structural systems. The main advantage of integrating QFD and AHP is that it reduces the inconsistency and uncertainty in the QFD inputs. The methodology is implemented in a real case study of a bridge project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), demonstrating improved results in structural system selection compared to traditional methods. While this research focused on the conceptual design phase of bridge projects, future work could extend to other phases of design.}

The novelty of this study lies in designing a PAW system model for agricultural cooperatives using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology, which integrates customer and engineer/designer perspectives. The results demonstrate a maximum 82.54% microbial removal rate on bird's eye chili under optimal conditions (e.g., exposure time = 20 min, Ar gas flow rate = 5 L/min, and O2 mixture = 2% Ar gas), indicating effective antimicrobial activity of plasma-activated water. Furthermore, a model of the PAW system for agricultural cooperatives, including cost and electrical power usage estimates, is proposed based on the correlation matrix of QFD. This conceptual PAW model for agricultural cooperatives warrants further investigation to assess its consistency in sterilization efficiency and long-term effects on treated agricultural products.}

In the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the advanced co-design software implementation to support the supply chain is not a trivial task. SMEs have peculiar characteristics such as flexibility, ICT skills and financial resources, which are difficult to be integrated within a structured design network. This paper presents a method to define and evaluate a co-design platform dedicated to SMEs in the mechanical product field. System architecture is defined by applying suitable metrics based on collaborative process characteristics in order to assess functionality performance of the available tools. Benchmarking is based on different levels of collaboration recognized in the typical product development process in SMEs. Correlation between process metrics, software functionalities and specific collaboration requirements is managed by adopting Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques. A practical case study allows the robustness of the proposed method to be verified and the main advantages and future developments to be discussed.}

abstract = {Driven by the pressure from various stakeholders to embrace sustainability and from the market to enhance competitiveness, more and more companies have been committed to conducting sustainable supplier selection (SSS). SSS is a requirement-driven multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem and the existing literatures have attempted to integrate quality function deployment (QFD) with various MCDM methods to model the problem. However, these models have not conducted SSS based on stakeholders’ satisfaction from alternatives, and used the weights of criteria obtained from stakeholders’ preferences for requirements, which is used to model the compensation among satisfaction levels of different requirements, to guide the compensation among alternatives’ performances on different criteria. In order to address these deficiencies, this paper develops a novel generalized (QFD)-based MCDM structure for SSS, based on which we further design a QFD-based multi-stakeholders and multi-experts MCDM model considering stakeholders’ consensus of interest and wisdom of expert crowds. Firstly, multiple stakeholder groups with multiple participants in each one are asked to output their expectations and preferences for their own requirements; within each group, the algorithm for consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed to formulate the acceptable collective expectations, and the best worst method (BWM) method integrated with an algorithm for consistency improving process (CIP) and an algorithm for CRP is developed to weight requirements. Secondly, multiple experts use basic uncertain linguistic information (BULI) to characterize performances of alternatives on criteria and relationship between requirements and criteria, and a method of weighting individual judgements with the capability of drawing on wisdom of crowds (WOC) while accommodating organizers’ trust level in reliability given by experts is used to facilitate formulating collective judgements. Thirdly, for each alternative and each requirement of each stakeholder group, we can quantify the comprehensive performance of the alternative on the requirement with the help of QFD, based on which and the group’s expectation we can use the value function of prospect theory to quantify the group’s satisfaction of the requirement from the alternative; aggregating the weighted satisfaction levels of requirements gives rise to the comprehensive satisfaction level of each group from each alternative; and then the Maximin decision rule is introduced to rank alternatives because of its ability of accommodating the non-compensation among different stakeholder groups. Finally, a case study is conducted to investigate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.}

A crucial step during QFD concerns the linking of engineering characteristics to customer needs in the House of Quality by the design team. It is generally assumed (looking at all the QFD success stories) that design teams can accurately predict the correlations between customer needs and engineering characteristics (also referred to as “Whats”/“Hows” correlations). This paper explicitly tests this assumption by comparing the “Whats”/“Hows” correlations estimated by a design team with those observed in a systematic user evaluation study, which has not been done before. Testing the assumption is important, because inaccurate estimates may lead to ergonomically ineffective (re)design of hand tools and a waste of company resources. Results revealed that the design team's correlation estimates were not as accurate as is generally assumed. Twenty-five percent of the estimates differed significantly with those observed in the user evaluation study. Thus, QFD is a useful method to assist design teams in designing ergonomically more comfortable hand tools, but only on the condition that the correlations between customer needs and engineering characteristics are validated, preferably by means of a systematic user evaluation study.}

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is a product development process used to achieve higher customer satisfaction: the engineering characteristics affecting the product performance are designed to match the customer requirements. From the viewpoint of QFDs designers, product design processes are performed in uncertain environments, and usually more than one goal must be taken into account. Therefore, when dealing with the fuzzy nature in QFD processes, fuzzy approaches are applied to formulate the relationships between customer requirements (CRs) and engineering design requirements (DRs), and among DRs. In addition to customer satisfaction, the cost and technical difficulty of DRs are also considered as the other two goals, and are evaluated in linguistic terms. Fuzzy goal programming models are proposed to determine the fulfillment levels of the DRs. Differing from existing fuzzy goal programming models, the coefficients in the proposed model are also fuzzy in order to expose the fuzziness of the linguistic information. Our model also considers business competition by specifying the minimum fulfillment levels of DRs and the preemptive priorities between goals. The proposed approach can attain the maximal sum of satisfaction degrees of all goals under each confidence degree. A numerical example is used to illustrate the applicability of the approach.}

abstract = {Mobile cellular telecommunication success in target markets first requires ranking the customer’s expectations and then prioritizing the engineering characteristics (ECs) to meet the expectations. In this paper, two prioritization models based on quality function deployment (QFD) are developed to rank the strategic actions (SAs), or the ECs of Iran mobile cellular telecommunication. QFD is a widely used customer-driven tool for which the success of its applications may be the result of some of its benefits, such as greater customer focus. It uses a matrix called House of Quality (HOQ) to translate Customer Attributes (CAs) into ECs. However, due to the high degree of subjectivity in constructing the HOQ, the application of fuzzy logic provides an efficient tool to handle the subjective assessments. On the other hand, taking into consideration the gap between the current state and the positive ideal state for each CA, TOPSIS is used to rank CAs in a first model. In addition, in a second model, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), more criteria are taken into consideration in ranking CAs. Also, a fuzzy utility factor, Bj, is used to rank SAs in both models. Both presented models have the ability to capture the vagueness of human thinking style, and let customer oriented organizations, such as MCI, derive benefits from the voice of the customer (VOC) in a more expressive way.}

In this article, Abbie Griffin presents results of a field-based, scientific study of US firms' efforts to implement QFD methods. Her research goals were to understand the QFD process as it is used and implemented, to begin to estimate US product development improvements attributable to QFD and to identify factors linked to QFD's successful use. Based on a study of 35 projects, she found that QFD demonstrated only relatively minor, short-term, measurable impacts on product development performance. Yet, the process may have the potential to improve the development climate in the long term, possibly leading to future, measurable improvements in development performance. Successful projects differed in several ways from those projects that failed in their implementation efforts. Finally, the results suggest several characteristics of product development processes that improve the way products are developed in US companies, including structuring the decision-making processes across functional groups, building a solidly organized, highly motivated team and moving information efficiently from its origin to the ultimate user.}

abstract = {As a widely used product improvement technique, the quality function deployment (QFD) can satisfy customer requirements and realize higher customer satisfaction by translating them into corresponding engineering characteristics. Nonetheless, two basic challenges hinder the effective application of QFD are the imprecise relationship assessments between customer requirements and engineering characteristics because of the uncertainty inherent in human judgements and the unreasonable importance ranking of engineering characteristics due to the heterogeneity of domain experts. In response, this paper puts forward a new hybrid QFD approach for the priority of engineering characteristics to satisfy customer requirements. First, multi-granular unbalanced linguistic term sets are utilized to describe the vague relational evaluations between customer requirements and engineering characteristics. Then, the opinion evolution social network consensus reaching model is employed to assist QFD experts in deriving consensual relational evaluations. Taking the conflict customer requirements into consideration, the combined compromise solution method is adopted and extended to derive the priority orders of engineering characteristics. To illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed QFD approach, a product development case about low pressure pulse filter is provided with comparative analysis and simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed approach can represent complex linguistic relationship assessments of experts and determine more accurate priority orders of engineering characteristics in QFD.}

abstract = {The patent marketplace has expanded significantly as an increasing number of patents are being filed. In turn, the demand for patent intermediaries is also expected to grow. One channel of patent flow for patentees to realize revenue is patent out-licensing, which involves high risk and uncertainty and a consuming need for coordination. Most patent licensing studies have focused on licensing modes, patented technology valuation, and price negotiation. However, many patent licensing issues involve a lack of systematic and objective assessment. This study attempts to establish a licensor selection model based on a hybrid model that embeds fuzzy logic within Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for the patent transaction platform. Experts from industries and professional organizations help a patent intermediary establish licensor selection and licensee requirement criteria, and establish weighting measures based on the input criteria and published patent specifications. We found that quality and applicability of patents and qualification and identification of licensors in patent licensing are the main factors for deriving a decision. With this model, licensees can select an optimal licensor according to their requirements. In a case study of a Chinese high-tech company, results reveal that the proposed hybrid fuzzy-QFD approach can successfully deal with complex licensing selection criteria to find an optimal solution and has the potential for handling multiple criteria decision-making problems in the patent marketplace.}

There are many approaches to supply chain risk management that focuses on operational risks. These approaches look to mitigate or eliminate the most critical risks in order to achieve the results that the chain expects. This paper presents a methodological approach using Ontologies and Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) to eliminate or mitigate the most important risks.

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is a planning and problem-solving tool that is gaining acceptance for translating customer requirements (CRs) into engineering characteristics (ECs) of a product. Deriving the importance of ECs is a crucial step of applying QFD. However, the inherent fuzziness in QFD presents a special challenge to effectively evaluate the importance of ECs and correlation among them. Furthermore, degree of impact of an engineering characteristic (EC) on the other ECs also reflects the importance of the ECs. In previous studies, those impacts were neglected or simply represented using a linear combination in determining the importance of ECs. To address this issue, in this paper, a new methodology of determining aggregated importance of ECs is presented which involves the consideration of conventional meaning of importance of ECs as well as the impacts of an EC on other ECs. In the proposed methodology, fuzzy relation measures between CRs and ECs as well as fuzzy correlation measures among ECs are determined based on fuzzy expert systems approach. These two types of measures are then used to determine the aggregated importance of ECs. An example of design of a digital camera is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.}
