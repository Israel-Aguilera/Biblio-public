abstract = {This study examined victim, family, and alleged perpetrator characteristics associated with fatal child maltreatment (FCM) in 685 cases identified by child welfare services in the state of Oklahoma over a 21-year period. Analyses also examined differences in child, family, and alleged perpetrator characteristics of deaths from abuse versus neglect. Case information was drawn from child welfare investigation records for all FCM cases identified by the state Department of Human Services. Fatal neglect accounted for the majority (51%) of deaths. Children were primarily younger than age 5, and parents were most frequently the alleged perpetrators. Moreover, most victims had not been the subject of a child welfare report prior to their death. A greater number of children in the home and previous family involvement with child welfare increased children's likelihood of dying from neglect, rather than physical abuse. In addition, alleged perpetrators of neglect were more likely to be female and biologically related to the victim. These results indicate that there are unique family risk factors for death from neglect (versus physical abuse) that may be important to consider when selecting or developing prevention efforts.}

abstract = {China is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and consumers of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications. Current estimates show that China will need over 3billion RFID tags to satisfy demand in the year 2009. The applications for RFID patents have spread across a very diverse range of inventions and in the future it is likely that most products manufactured in China will contain an RFID tag. China’s RFID industry has grown along with the demand and researchers are making significant technological advances. In this research, patent data from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China (SIPO) have been used to explore RFID technology development and its trends. Patent abstracts containing the keyword and phrase “RFID” and “Radio Frequency Identification” were collected for analysis, content extraction, and clustering. In total, 1389 patents from the SIPO database covering the years 1995–2008 were retrieved and archived for analysis. Patents provide exclusive rights and legal protection for inventors, play an important role in the development and fair diffusion of technology, and contain detailed specifications necessary to define and protect the boundaries of an invention. Through patent analysis, companies monitor the development of technology and evaluate the position of potential competitors in the market. This research introduce a methodology which combines patent content clustering and technology life cycle forecasting to find a niche space of RFID technology development in China. A patent content clustering method is used to cluster different patent documents into homogenous groups, and then technology forecasting is applied to evaluate possible market opportunities for future inventors and investors. The results suggest that the cluster called RFID wireless communication devices has entered the saturation stage and thus provides limited opportunity for development. Four other clusters; RFID concepts and applications, RFID architecture, RFID tracking implementation, and RFID transmission apparatus, have entered the mature stage. The RFID frequency and waves cluster appears to be in early growth stage with good development potential. Since the technology related to basic RFID concepts and devices has reached a mature stage in China, the research and development seems to be targeting the improvement of the RFID frequencies and waves as a means to develop more reliable RFID systems and applications.}

This method integrates the fuzzy clustering method, fault tree analysis and an analytic hierarchy process. First, it builds a classification for different factors based on Faulty Tree Analysis methods. Then, the logical relationships between each factors are prioritized and determined. Once the logical hierarchies are established, the Entropy-House of Quality for quantitative analysis is employed to support big blackout prevention and decision-making for various influential factors. Finally, Sichuan province are given to verify its effectiveness so that the policy-makers and security regulators in China can follow its recommendations to create a better electricity supply security management and a more sustainable energy reform in the future.}

Aboveground biomass in the less-shade-tolerant Homogyne and in the annual hemiparasite Melampyrum was strongly increased with increasing CO2, but not in the more shade-adapted Oxalis. In contrast, increased N deposition stimulated growth in Oxalis, but had no effect on Homogyne and Melampyrum. Due to spruce canopy closure Homogyne became light limited and its survivorship was strongly correlated with spruce canopy LAI in the second year of the experiment. Our results suggest, that elevated CO2 facilitates the expansion of Homogyne into less favourable micro-habitats (deeper shade) and that increasing N deposition enables more vigorously growing species like Oxalis to increase in abundance. Growth of the hemiparasite Melampyrum was stimulated indirectly by increased heterotrophic carbon supply (carbon isotope data) from the host (Picea abies), and thus, this species may also increase in abundance with increasing CO2. However, possible indirect effects (canopy feedbacks) make predictions of long-term understory development difficult.
Résumé
Nous avons étudié les effets d'un enrichissement en CO2 atmosphérique (280, 420 et 560 μmol CO2 mol−1) et d'une augmentation de l'apport en N (0, 30 et 90 kg ha−1 a−1) sur Oxalis acetosella, Homogyne alpina et Melampyrum sylvaticum cultivés dans des écosystèmes modèles sous des épicéas. La biomasse épigée d'Homogyne (la moins tolérante à l'ombre) et de l'hémiparasite annuelle Melampyrum s'accroît fortement avec une augmentation du CO2 mais ce n'est pas le cas d'Oxalis qui est mieux adaptée à l'ombre. En revanche, l'augmentation de l'apport en azote stimule la croissance d'Oxalis, mais n'a pas d'effet sur Homogyne et Melampyrum. En raison de la fermeture de la canopée des épicéas, Homogyne a subi une limitation de l'apport en lumière et sa survie était fortement corrélée au LAI de la canopée d'épicéas au cours de la seconde année d'expérimentation. Nos résultats suggèrent qu'une élévation du CO2 facilite l'expansion d'Homogyne vers des micro-habitats moins favorables (ombre plus dense) et qu'une augmentation de l'apport en azote permet à des espèces plus vigoureuses, comme Oxalis, de devenir plus abondantes. La croissance de l'hémiparasite Melampyrum est stimulée indirectement par l'apport accru de carbone hétérotrophique (données isotopes du carbone) en provenance de l'hôte (Picea abies); en conséquence, cette espèce pourrait aussi devenir plus abondante avec une augmentation du CO2. Néanmoins, de possibles effets indirects (rétroactions de la canopée) rendent difficiles des prédictions à long terme sur le développement du sous-bois.}

In order to avoid literal infringement and doctrine of equivalents, the design around problem identification process of Trimming one or more patent Technical Features is developed. Then, the problem solving tools based on Modern TRIZ tools (such as Physical Contradiction resolution, and Function-Oriented Search) are introduced to solve the design around problem. Two Trimming scenarios of Core Ejector System is investigated to illustrate the method. The project successfully circumvents target patent and generates several new granted patents in China.}

The extent analysis proves to be incorrect and may lead to a wrong decision being made.

Some models are needed mainly in specific phases of the product life cycle, which are discussed in detail in the paper. Especially in the conceptual design phase some design-characteristic aspects such as hierarchy of parameters, modularity of the design should be analyzed, because in this phase the largest part of the later resulting product costs is predetermined or even fixed. As a consequence, the scope for design is limited to merely small changes in the subsequent design phases.

Results show that G/L has the most significant influence on the CO2 removal efficiency. Influences of the latter two on CO2 removal efficiency are not apparent. Tests results of G/L effect on CO2 removal efficiency show that, when G/L=1∼5, CO2 removal efficiency increases rapidly with the increase of G/L; when G/L=5, CO2 removal efficiency=80%∼88%; when G/L=8, CO2 removal efficiency=86%∼92%, when G/L>8, CO2 removal efficiency increases gently with the increase of G/L.

Traditional green design has focused on the recycling of waste and the extension of the life cycle of product materials. Some scholars also consider emotional Customer Requirements (CRs) in eco-friendly products, but prioritize appearance over environmental function innovation. The rapid development of internet technology has enabled the proliferation of online product reviews, which can be analyzed to inform eco-innovative product design that meets CRs. Based on the CRs extracted from online reviews, this paper proposes an eco-innovative product design method that aims to recycle waste and meet emotional CRs. Firstly, online reviews are extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and CRs for environmental protection functions, appearance, human-computer interaction, and service experience are summarized by integrating sustainable design concepts and emotional design theories. Secondly, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is utilized to suggest targeted solutions for core CRs, innovating product function modules and usage. Thirdly, the combination of Kansei Engineering (KE) and the Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) is utilized for appearance design. Lastly, the research process is explained using the proposed method, with the example of a coffee maker's design, and its effectiveness and practicality are verified. The proposed method aims to recycle waste, optimize resource utilization, achieve environmental protection goals, and provide innovative approaches for advancing the circular economy.

Taking China as an example, this paper investigates the green finance policy coupling effect of fossil energy use rights trading (FET), renewable energy certificates trading (RECT), and renewable energy subsidies (RES) on the low carbon economy using a dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The main findings of this paper are as follows. (1) When using a game equity fixed-cost allocation model (Game-EFCAM) to allocate fossil energy use rights quotas among sectors, allocations differ in only a few sectors compared to the base period, and most sectors have relatively stable allocations compared to the base period. (2) The implementation of FET and RECT has a negative impact on per capita GDP. In the short term, RES can mitigate the negative impact of FET and RECT on per capita GDP, but eventually, the government needs to guide the enterprise innovation to improve the industrial structure to realize the double benefits of green finance policy. (3) The implementation of FET and RECT limits fossil energy consumption and also reduces the production possibility frontier of the secondary industries with higher levels of fossil energy consumption. The implementation of FET and RECT increases the proportions of tertiary industry and renewable energy. (4) The implementation of FET and RECT reduces carbon emissions. In other words, the implementation of FET and RECT mitigates the negative environmental externality. RES can enhance the carbon reduction efforts of FET and RECT. This research not only provides policy analysis for the development of the low carbon economy in China, but also gives a reference for other developing countries’ low carbon economy transition.}

abstract = {Setting of process variables to meet a required specification of quality characteristic (or response variable) in a process, is one of the common problems in the process quality control. But generally there are more than one quality characteristics in the process and the experimenter attempts to optimize all of them simultaneously. Since response variables are different in some properties such as scale, measurement unit, type of optimality and their preferences, there are different approaches in model building and optimization of MRS problems. This study propose a general framework in MRS problems according to some existing works and some types of related decision makers and attempts to aggregate all of characteristics in one approach. The proposed framework contains four non-desirability parts of bias, response variation, errors in predictions and separation from responses’ specific region. We demonstrate the proposed framework with two examples of the literature and the results has been discussed with comparing of mentioned existing works.}

The realization of concurrent engineering is not so simple because the product development space has a coupled heterogeneous information such as product, process, organizations, resources and others. To reach a QCD-effective product specification, how the properties of product(P), process(P), and organization (O) affects QCD must be analyzed. In this paper, the qualitative analysis of QCD and PPO is discussed, and the approaches to improve QCD in concurrent engineering are proposed. QCD is classified into die QCD of the development process and QCD of the manufacturing process. In PPO analysis, the relationship between product, process and organization is defined according to a QCD viewpoint. This analysis will be the basis for quantitative or mathematical approaches of concurrent engineering.}

Since methods to evaluate the feasibility of new businesses vary with the characteristics of businesses, the evaluation methods might need to be modified to reflect unique nature in the design of a new PSS. Therefore, this paper aims at improving the applicability of evaluation methods for designing a new PSS by proposing a new framework and performing an empirical study where a new evaluation method can be used for PSSs. To this end, first, the meanings of service innovation, PSS, and evaluation methods in service research will be investigated. Second, an evaluation method for designing a new PSS will be suggested by considering the perspectives of service providers as well as customers. Finally, the method will be applied to evaluate the feasibility of designing a car-sharing service that is a use-oriented PSS. This method will provide a good means of drawing a potentially successful PSS by applying the proposed evaluation methodology and process.}

Customer characteristics and emotional factors play an important role here. This study proposes a novel approach for modelling satisfaction and accomplishing a configuration that overcomes the limitations of conventional methods to precisely predict satisfaction, provide optimal product recommendations, and advise manufacturers on product appearance design. The newly proposed approach considers satisfaction, clusters customers through the Kansei perspective, and constructs a satisfaction model for each cluster. Additionally, the study employs data mining to understand the basic design principles and conflicted combinations that must be followed and avoided, respectively. The bidirectional association rules-constrained genetic algorithm is presented to limit configuration freedom, ensuring that results are in the range of control. Comparing prediction errors and recommended sample votes between the novel and conventional approaches revealed the presented approach’s efficiency and accuracy, thereby providing suggestions for manufacturers to make precise decisions on launching new product appearance designs through predicting customer emotional satisfaction.}

This study solved the PSS implementation that satisfied the demands of both customers and manufacturers and the value cocreation mechanism during product and service configuration with the impacts of consumer learning and the service experience. The proposed neuroscience methodology is based on an ERP (event-related potential) experiment using PSS stimuli, representing the perception value creation process during customer decision making and the PSS configuration process. The effectiveness of the service experience is more important than customer knowledge during PSS value perception due to positive emotions with pleasant memories for the service experience and the conflicting cognition process of customer learning. The combination of service science and neurology may measure and observe human behavior and psychology through the brain science method and effectively solve the human factors in service science. The findings suggest a more objective and personalized understanding of PSS value perception, particularly the practical requirements of a resulted-oriented PSS and an application-oriented PSS.}

The system developed takes advantages of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), thus to focus on main clients’ needs. Decisions about real estate assets are frequently made by managers with incomplete and scattered data, not sufficient to fully support the decision making process. Using a BIM model as a central repository of information could strongly support to compare objectively different scenarios and consequently to decide the application of a multi-criteria matrix involving management, energy, economic and social issues. BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modelling) techniques have a wide potential and analysis capabilities; however, they are often adopted without an integrated framework, causing missing performances and costs overrun. The result is a system enabling to analyze the asset, to produce BIM and BEM models ready to include life cycle data, to evaluate feasible alternatives and scenarios and to extract relevant performance indicators for decision makers’ support. An existing office building in Milan representing an awkward field for intervention is the case study for the system application. While the tools and software adopted are commonly used, the system of procedures developed by the authors can be considered as an ensemble of workflows otherwise typically used independently. Using them together enhance the decision process providing data on which to set up a strategic plan of the refurbishment considering costs, continuity in occupancy and energy efficiency.}

Sustainable assessment of technology investigates the economic, environmental, and social effects of technologies on firms and their environment. Nonetheless, the technology management process includes different steps (such as technology acquisition and exploitation) which need a comprehensive decision-making tool toward sustainable development targets. This paper aims to propose an integrated decision-making model to investigate the social sustainability of the technology management process. Considering three main steps of the technology management process (technology selection, technology acquisition, and technology exploitation), we constructed our model utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as one of the most popular decision-making tools. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the model, we implemented it for E-banking technologies in one of the oldest banks of Iran (Iran's AgriBank). The results indicated that internet banking, internal R&D, and internal exploitation are the best decision alternatives among the technology management process from the social sustainability perspective. The results were validated by calculating the Consistency Rate (CR) and performing scenario-based sensitivity analysis.}

In this research, risk mitigation strategies for environmentally sustainable clothing supply chain have been prioritised by considering their efficacy to mitigate various risks. Twelve risks and thirteen mitigation strategies, identified through literature review and experts' opinion, are considered as decision criteria and alternatives respectively. Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (fuzzy TOPSIS) is implemented under a group decision making scenario for prioritising the strategies. Developing supply chain agility; multiple green sourcing and flexible capacities; adoption of green practices; building trust, coordination and collaboration; and alignment of economic incentives and revenue sharing are found to be dominant risk mitigation strategies for environmentally sustainable clothing supply chain. These strategies have been viewed through the lens of resource dependence, change management and transaction cost theories.

This paper investigates a kind of MCDM problems with two-level criteria and develops a novel hybrid method integrating TL-ANP (2-tuple linguistic analytic network process) and IT-ELECTRE II (interval 2-tuple Elimination and Choice Translating Reality II). Considering interactions among criteria, a TL-ANP approach, in which comparison matrices are consistent 2-tuple linguistic preference relations, is put forward to determine weights of criteria and sub-criteria. To deal with the case of criteria being not compensated, an IT-ELECTRE II approach is proposed. In this approach, ratings of alternatives on sub-criteria are represented as interval 2-tuple linguistic variables. A possible degree and a likelihood-based preference degree are respectively defined, followed by concordance, discordance and indifferent sets. Afterwards, concordance and discordance indices are identified and applied to establish net concordance and net discordance indices. Further, comprehensive dominant values of alternatives are obtained to rank alternatives. Thereby, a novel hybrid method is presented for MCDM with two-level criteria under interval 2-tuple linguistic environment. At length, a real case of supplier selection is examined and comparison analyses are conducted to illustrate the application and superiority of the proposed method.}

This contradicts the reality that the robot selection decision is usually made by a committee or a group of experts with different expertise and concerns. For this reason, this paper proposes a group decision making (GDM) methodology for handling multiple criteria robot selection problem (MCRSP), the working process of which is (i) identifying experts, (ii) implementing the standard MCDM process and (iii) achieving a group consensus. Four objective weight determination methods, namely, Shannon entropy, CRITIC, ideal point and distance-based, are proposed to represent four experts. Experts play the role of think tank in supporting the decision maker who is responsible for MCRSP. In light of that the preference among different experts is uncertain, stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis is then applied to achieve a holistic evaluation results for identifying good compromise choices. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our methodology, and compare the results with those obtained through VIKOR and ELECTRE II.}

The correct positioning of the charging points for such vehicles certainly promotes the acceptance and spread of EVs. Indeed, selecting optimal locations for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) is crucial for shaping a sustainable future. This study introduces an integrated methodology under a double hierarchy linguistic context with a criteria importance through an inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) technique for experts' reliability determination, an attitudinal Cronbach's method for criteria weight estimation, and a novel multi-criteria technique considering the compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution (CRADIS) formulation for optimal EVCS location selection. Based on the results, criteria such as service capability, ecological impact, land cost, and traffic density are the most crucial, with Manapparai, India, as the optimal location for a new EVCS construction. Further, a crucial finding is that the social dimension is substantial compared to the economy and environment dimensions for EVCS location selection. The novelty of the paper is that (i) uncertainty and expression of choices in natural language form for locations for EVCS are modeled effectively using a double hierarchy structure, (ii) experts' weights are obtained methodically by considering hesitation and interactions among experts, (iii) interdependencies among criteria and importance of experts are considered during criteria weight determination, and (iv) locations are ranked by not only considering criteria type but also resembles closely to the human-centric decision process. A detailed sensitivity analysis is further conducted to prove the proposed approach's effectiveness and stability. In the context of sustainable transportation, the work could contribute to the relevant literature through a powerful decision-making tool.}

As the maintenance suppliers play a significant role in the context of the availability of spare parts and other materials needed for the effective realization of the maintenance process in order to assure the overall quality of the manufactured products, it is vital to achieve the aforementioned via minimization of machinery down time and maintenance backlogs.

The HSCCA setup recommended by us follows a layered presentation of storing data and explains about various participants that covey and also ensures service delivery to the end-users. Our suggested method also investigates Cyber Security (CS) instituted for smart cities. Besides, we also highlight the specific features of SC generated challenges regarding cybersecurity, along with the reviewing of various aspects of risks associated with it. Eventually, our research concludes with the evaluation of certain significant cybersecurity solutions for smart cities proposed for HSCCA. This paper recommends a context-specific safety setup for conventional cyber–physical systems and put forth a few prospective areas for exploring and their impact.}

This paper addresses the research gap in designing and using next-generation manufacturing execution systems (MES)/manufacturing operations management (MOM) in IIoT to improve manufacturing flexibility through reconfigurability. For this, we follow an abductive research design and build on the literature on Industry 4.0′s information architectures and models to propose a framework for building smart factory capabilities. Using the framework, we collect empirical data on MES/MOM implementation objectives for smart factories for six case studies conducted over a 4-year research project in Denmark (2018–2021), primarily through semi-structured interviews. Through cross-case analysis, we identify seven dominant themes that capture focus areas for MES/MOM implementation for IT/OT integration. We use these findings to present generalized design recommendations for IIoT-connected MES/MOM to support reconfigurability for Industry 4.0 supply chains. Our findings indicate that despite considerable investments from many companies in Industry 4.0 initiatives such as artificial intelligence-based analytics and digital twins, the industry is not yet in a state to extract the data from all its legacy production equipment. Therefore, we present design recommendations to enable Industry 4.0 supply chains with IIoT-connected MES/MOM by using the data from OT devices. Our analysis helps us conclude that open standards and open application programming interfaces (APIs) are key requirements for enhancing IIoT interconnectivity and interoperability to achieve end-to-end integration in supply chains.}

The system consists of four elements: a chain molecule; a set of free (elemental) molecules, all of which refer to the elements of DNA; a quasi-free molecule, which is the last elemental molecule of the chain molecule; and a molecular machine. When the system works, a definite reconfiguration, referred to as addition, takes place. Addition actually adds a free molecule to the chain molecule to make it grow longer. The molecular machine decides which type of free molecule should be added taking into account the informational state of the system. A simulation model is also developed based on DAS to help generate chain molecule applying successive additions. This model can be used to simulate chain molecules that exhibit the characteristics of genetic molecules (i.e. molecules with identifiable segments) and behaviors of dynamical systems. How to correlate the characteristics of a dynamical system with the characteristics of DAS is also pointed out. Further study should be carried out to enhance the knowledge of DAS from both theory and application points of view.}

By means of a direct to mobile user Internet access, and total IP services, integrated into automobiles, S@tMax services can empower the mobile business movement therefore improving productivity. This paper presents a commercial system architecture that will deliver an optimized solution for direct to mobile user Internet access, through an integration of a ground based network infrastructure, use of existing communications satellites and the development of a proprietary satellite system. As a result of a detailed systems engineering process, the architectures of the space, ground and infrastructures segments will be presented. Furthermore, the benefits of on-orbit servicing were examined in the S@tMax context. The approach proposed is considered as an important step towards enforcing main roadway IP coverage in the US, for near-continuous communications and services.}

To examine the preferences and choice behavior across firms of various sizes, a total of 285 air freight forwarding firms offering air freight services from Taiwan to Asia or global were categorized into small, medium, and large by the average tons of cargo handled annually. The latent class model that identifies the heterogeneous preferences among different categories of air freight forwarders was found to perform well in estimating influential factors. The findings indicate that large-sized and medium-sized firms have different concerns about the choice of air carriers from small-sized firms, e.g., (1) offering shipping discounts for high-volume customers, (2) ensuring a low rate of lost, damaged or destroyed cargo, and (3) performing freight forwarding service consistent with the shipping agreements. The findings also identify heterogeneity in preferences for shipping routes between large-sized and small-sized firms, e.g., (1) destination airports providing efficient cargo handling services, and (2) destination airports offering fast and effective customs clearance services.}

We tested if contaminated Aedes albopictus (Skuse) mosquitoes from a small area treated with commercial formulations (79gm a.i. pyriproxyfen/ha) using conventional techniques, would disseminate pyriproxyfen over a wider area. Pyriproxyfen showed LC50=0.012 ppb for Ae. albopictus. Direct treatment and autodissemination efficacy was measured as a pupal mortality by conducting Ae. albopictus larval bioassay. A tire pile (n=100 tires) treated by backpack sprayer as a point-source treatment showed higher pupal mortality in 2010 (60.8% for week 0–6) than in 2011 (38.3% for week 0–6). The sentinel containers placed for autodissemination in four compass directions out to 200–400m from the tire pile showed 15.8% pupal mortality (week 1–6) in the first year, and 1.4% pupal mortality in the second year. No significant difference was detected among the distances and direction for pupal mortality. In area-wide treatments, vegetation was sprayed in checkerboard pattern (3.7% of 105ha) using backpack sprayer in 2010 and in strips (24.8% of 94ha) using truck-mounted ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayer in 2011. In both years, the area-wide direct treatment efficacy was lower (30.3% during 2010 and 5.3% in 2011) than point-source treatments. Autodissemination in area-wide plots was higher in 2010 (10.3%) than 2011 (2.9%). However, area-wide treatments were ineffective on field populations of Ae. albopictus as monitored by using BGS traps. We found accumulation of pyriproxyfen in the week 6 autodissemination containers in both experiments. The differences in autodissemination in 2010 and 2011 can be attributed to higher rainfall in the second year that may have eroded the pyriproxyfen from treatment surfaces and sentinel containers. Our study shows that ULV surface treatments of conventional formulation do not work for autodissemination. The effectiveness of pyriproxyfen in autodissemination may be improved by developing specific formulations to treat vegetation and tires that can load high doses on mosquitoes.}

Some solutions differ qualitatively from traditional ones. It is shown that almost each local extremal revealed provides a global optimum within a certain range of parameter values. The change in the type of the global extremal is, as a rule, of bifurcation nature. Multiplicity of local extremals and significantly nonlinear effects in the behavior of globally optimal solutions are basically caused by the presence of aerodynamic forces which can be sufficiently small as compared with the vehicle weight. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of the study of different types of local extremals at all aerospace vehicle design stages because the implementation of nontraditional optimal control laws can demand changes in the space vehicle configuration.}

The theory has been widely used in many fields since early 2000s when innovation became an integral part of the modern World. Despite that, the analysis showed that the number of publications related to application of TRIZ in construction is less than 2% out of all TRIZ-related studies in the SCOPUS database. The paper is organized in the following order: introduction into the topic, the principle of obtaining the dataset for the review, Short description of TRIZ and its possible application in construction, discussion of demand of innovation in building industry and the main body consisting of TRIZ in Development of Construction Techniques and Technologies, TRIZ in Design of New Structures and Construction Materials and TRIZ in Construction Project Management and Value Engineering.

abstract = {Background
Population aging is inducing governments to redesign their healthcare models. One policy measure aimed at reducing healthcare expenditures and improving services is to encourage people to age-in-place. Scientific research has been trying to find ICT-enabled solutions to the growing problem of elderly home care. However, such research is often technology-oriented and neglects the end-user perspective. It does not consider the real needs of older people and all stakeholders involved in their healthcare.
Method
A user-centered design approach was adopted with the involvement of older people, experts dealing with the aging population, and the whole stakeholders’ chain. Through surveys, focus groups, and brainstorming sessions, it was possible to determine the main features of the product service platform.
Results
Starting from a large-scale survey of elderly people living in Italy, this paper presents the requirements and the architecture of a product service platform aimed at improving the independence and elderly quality of life. This work proposes an elderly-centered platform that works as an aggregation point of an articulated social health system, provides multiple tailored services, and optimizes the use of local resources.
Conclusions
The involvement of the end-user and all the stakeholders allowed for the consideration of different perspectives and the creation of a value network that aggregates existing services, resources, and information with new opportunities to achieve common benefits. This work provides guidelines on how to develop this type of platform by exploiting the potential of each stakeholder without creating new barriers. Technology, caregivers, and society are combined synergistically to provide tailored services able to satisfy specific users’ needs.}

We also present an estimate of the amount that anglers would be willing to pay for a goliath grouper harvest tag (the right sold to an angler to harvest one goliath grouper). A survey was mailed to a random sample of Florida (USA) residents with a recreational fishing license. Approximately half of the respondents agreed that the goliath grouper should now be open to recreational take. A probit analysis indicated that the best predictor for the opinion the fishery should be open is the belief that there are “too many goliath grouper.” Also, more anglers agreed than disagreed that goliath grouper are eating “all the fish on the reef,” a belief that was related to anglers personally viewing goliath grouper depredation. The mean willingness to pay for a goliath grouper harvest tag was estimated to be between $34 and $79. This information can be used to estimate the potential revenues available from a hypothetical tag system and can be compared with the economic value of goliath grouper in non-consumptive uses such as recreational diving.}

However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. The VIKOR method was developed to solve multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with conflicting and non-commensurable (different units) criteria, assuming that compromising is acceptable for conflict resolution, the decision maker wants a solution that is the closest to the ideal, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. In this paper, linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for these factors. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, a hierarchy MCDM model based on fuzzy sets theory and VIKOR method is proposed to deal with the supplier selection problems in the supply chain system. A numerical example is proposed to illustrate an application of the proposed model.}

Initially, the production process map was drawn up according to the IDEF0 standard. The OEE rate was then extracted over a two-month period at one-week intervals as a pre-test. In the next phase, the types of potential failures in the production process were identified and the three parameters of the severity of the failures, probability of occurrence and probability of failure detection for each failure state were extracted in the linguistic variable. Afterward, the Risk Priority Number of each failure was determined by the defuzzification of triangular fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, considering the causes of failures, solutions for the elimination or reduction of the effects of prioritized failures were identified and implemented. The OEE was calculated as a post-test at weekly intervals over the next two months of career time to test the effectiveness of the measures taken, which resulted in a 6.05% increase in OEE indicating the effectiveness of interventions. Finally, in order to study the effect of reducing fuzzy RPN on OEE, the values of the corresponding parameters were extracted weekly over a two-month period and their correlation was tested in the form of 16 hypotheses. The results of the research showed a negative correlation between all the parameters.}

abstract = {The European Commission has proposed a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to reduce carbon leakage and create a level playing field for its domestic products and imported goods. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the proposal remains unclear, especially when it triggers threats of retaliation from trading partners of the European Union. We apply a Computable General Equilibrium model - Global Trade Analysis Project - to assess the economic and environmental impacts of different CBAM schemes. Here we show that the effectiveness of the CBAM to address carbon leakage risks is rather limited, and the CBAM raises concerns over global welfare costs, Correct to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses, and violation of equality principles. Trade retaliation leads to multiplied welfare losses, which would mostly be borne by poor countries. Our results question the carbon leakage reduction effect of a unilateral trade policy and suggest that climate change mitigation still needs to be performed within the framework of international cooperation.}

To get an in-depth understanding of the current research characteristics and development in the research domain, and help researchers dig into the more information from a quantitative perspective, we retrieved 1091 documents about SS-related research based on SD published in the period 2000–2020 from the Web of Science Core Collection database in this paper, the bibliometric analysis and science mapping were carried out. The USA, China, UK, Germany and Australia were the five most contributions to the literature associated with SS research based on SD. In terms of the major sources and co-citation of SS-related research publications, IEEE Transactions on Power System, Safety Science, Energy Policy, System Dynamics Review and Reliability Engineering & System Safety are the five most active journals in this domain. The knowledge base of SS research based on SD focuses on “safety management”, “risk analysis” and “network and information security”. There are some significant differences between the safety and security domains while they are very similar in “risk analysis”. Currently, hotspot topics include “safety management”, “energy security”, “resource utilization” and “industry applications”. “system safety and reliability”, “energy consumption and security” and “power system dynamics and stability” have become the research frontier in the field.}

This paper presents the findings from case study research into these operational factors, providing a ‘wider picture’ of DfRem integration. Our case studies of three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) from the UK mechanical industry sector have led to the identification of significant external and internal operational factors including design priorities, OEM-remanufacturer relationships and designer motivation affecting these companies. The paper then goes on to discuss future work that will contribute towards enabling OEMs to assess their company maturity with regards to design for remanufacture.}

It not only improves the performance of the product, but also leads to the greatest satisfaction of customers. However, existing methods express qualitative evaluation information roughly, and none of them has taken the implicit psychological states of customers into consideration. Therefore, an integrated decision-making method for product design scheme evaluation is proposed. This method applies the cloud model to facilitate the evaluation process of experts and uses the EEG data to reveal the psychological states of customers. Benefit from the probability theory and fuzzy set theory, the cloud model deals with the fuzziness and randomness simultaneously. It can decrease the cognitive discrepancy of experts and allow the information distortion to be neutralized to a great extent. Since the experts are not the final users of products, the evaluation results from experts cannot truly reflect the psychological states of customers when they use the product. An experiment is designed to collect the EEG data which can reveal the implicit psychological states of customers. The recorded data are segmented based on the operation process and tagged with the self-reported psychological states. Subsequently, the wavelet packet decomposition is applied and the sample entropy of each EEG frequency band is extracted as the feature. Taking advantage of the random forest classifier, the psychological states of customers can be classified with the average accuracy of 90.76%. This study can lead to a practical system for automatic assessment of psychological states in future applications. The evaluation process of elevator design schemes is conducted as a case study to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.}

In this nexus, personal access to healthy food is shaped by a number of individual and geographical factors including people's time available for shopping, the quality of proximal food vendors (e.g. supermarkets vs. convenience stores), and the nature of the transportation systems available to facilitate mobility. Building on recent research in disaggregate accessibility modeling, including that of time geography, this paper describes an individual-level modeling approach for quantifying peoples' food environments. The approach works by measuring the accessibility people have to local food shopping opportunities given their activity patterns and available time budgets. Individuals' food accessibility may be compared to one another and the underlying mobility afforded by the transportation system is accounted for. Moreover, the individual-level measure is such that it may be resolved to places, whereby the aggregation and mapping of multiple individuals' food accessibility experiences is possible. Hence, possible ‘deserts’ or areas of inaccessibility may be identified through a bottom-up analysis of the travel and mobility experience of a representative sample of individuals. These ideas are demonstrated with spatial data from a smaller urban area in Florida. Results show that individual and place-based differences in food accessibility may be delineated with the metrics.}

abstract = {Framing effects have been shown to have dramatic impact on human decision making in many domains, in certain circumstances even driving self-detrimental behavior. Multi-stakeholder tradespace exploration (MSTSE), an emerging technique for advanced multiparty decision making for engineering systems, has displayed many benefits with regards to insight-generation and identification of mutually beneficial solutions. However, for complex problems with no solutions that are individually optimal for each stakeholder, stakeholders may still resist “compromising” from their individual preferred solutions. This occasionally drives a failure to reach agreement, despite a design space with a considerable number of feasible designs with value for all parties. This paper hypothesizes that this result may be caused in part by an unintentional framing of the initial stages of MSTSE as an individual problem, establishing an unrealistically high reference point. Theoretically, this locks stakeholders into a mindset that forces them to “compromise” down, rather than more appropriately building up mutual value from the “no agreement” alternative. This paper addresses the current literature of multi-stakeholder system design, the ramifications of framing on MSTSE, considerations for establishing a more appropriate reference point, and example techniques and visual representations for doing so. A preliminary set of experiments is described to confirm the hypothesized framing effect and to validate visual representations for mitigating its impact.}

Indeed, it is the highest contributor to aviation accidents, where stress is correlated positively. Despite the large research base for commercial or military pilots, there is no study related to the workplace stressors of ab-initio pilots. With these considerations in mind, the present study is set out to explore stress factors among ab-initio pilots in the university. For this purpose, stressors were isolated and assessed by interviews with flight instructors. Then, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to weigh those stressors among ab-initio pilots. A hierarchy was built with 3 criteria and 12 sub-criteria. Results showed that the most important criterion in stress among ab-initio pilots is personal factors, followed by organizational factors and environmental factors. Furthermore, the results revealed that the first four stressors within the global ranking were determined as the lack in body of knowledge, meteorological conditions, personality, and facilities and the fleet with the weights of 0.195, 0.154, 0.11 and 0.109. This work is unique due to its coverage of ab-initio pilots, and the results presented here may facilitate improvements in the evaluation of individual ab-initio pilots and the teaching environment for stress contributing factors.}

In ordinary plasmas, collective oscillations can be described in terms of fluctuations of the particle number densities. In the case of ultrarelativistic plasmas, it appears natural to consider also fluctuations in an amplitude which mixes photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. In leading order the theory yields the effective action of hard thermal loops by Taylor and Wong.}

Many times, the prototypes or demonstrators that result from such projects are supposed to evolve into commercial products or services, but – at least in the first stage - there are more focus on proving key features of a technology, or the effectiveness / efficiency / applicability of various concepts or algorithms. However, evolving into commercial products is many times at least as challenging as building the prototypes. In case of software-based projects, this means changes in architecture, a lot of code rewriting and important usability improvements. This paper introduces a software-concept product design algorithm which aims to minimize the effort required in turning a demonstrator into a commercial product. This is done by generating two functionality sets: a pure demonstrator and a pure commercial one, then generating a hybrid functionality set with the corresponding architecture, and then assessing each functionality for the demonstrator and the commercial version in terms of development and improvement effort. Through iterations, in which the original functionality sets are improved, the difference between the two perspectives will be reduced until it gets below a reasonable limit in terms of effort. The paper presents a case study in which the algorithm is applied for planning a software platform for supporting SMEs in their innovation processes.}

Continental margin forearc sands from the western North America continental margin arc system are clearly different from backarc/marginal-sea sands from the Aleutian intraoceanic arc system. The forearc sands have average QFL percentages of 29-42-29, LmLvLst percentages of 32-34-34, 3 Fmwk%M and 0.82 P/F. Aleutian backarc sands have average QFL percentages of 8-22-69. LmLvLst percentages of 9-85-6, 0.5 Fmwk%M and 0.96 P/F. A trend of increasing QFL%Q and decreasing LmLvLst%Lv westward in the backarc region of the Aleutian Ridge reflects the influence of the Asiatic continental margin. Aleutian backarc sands without continental influence have average QFL percentages of 1-20-79, LmLvLst percentages of 1-98-1, 0 Fmwk%M and 0.99 P/F. Of the continental margin forearc samples, sands on the Astoria Fan (west of the Oregon—Washington trench) contain the highest LmLvLst%Lv and lowest P/F; sands from mixed transform-fault and trench settings (Delgada Fan and Gulf of Alaska samples) have slightly higher Qp/Q (0.03); and sands from the Pacific-Juan de Fuca-North America triple junction have the highest Fmwk%M. Delgada Fan and Gulf of Alaska sands have average QFL percentages of 27-38-35, LmLvLst percentages of 37-26-37, 2 Fmwk%M and 0.86 P/F. Astoria Fan sands have average QFL percentages of 35-41-24, LmLvLst percentages of 30-47-23, 3 Fmwk%M and 0.74 P/F. The triple-junction sands have average QFL percentages of 28-59-13, LmLvLst percentages of 25-26-49, 9 Fmwk%M and 0.87 P/F. The petrologic data from the modern ocean basins examined in this study can provide useful analogs for interpretation of ancient oceanic sequences.

The mining industry is known worldwide for its highly risky and hazardous working environment. Technological advancement in ore extraction techniques for proliferation of production levels has caused further concern for safety in this industry. Research so far in the area of safety has revealed that the majority of incidents in hazardous industry take place because of human error, the control of which would enhance safety levels in working sites to a considerable extent.
Methods
The present work focuses upon the analysis of human factors such as unsafe acts, preconditions for unsafe acts, unsafe leadership, and organizational influences. A modified human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS) was adopted and an accident predictive fuzzy reasoning approach (FRA)-based system was developed to predict the likelihood of accidents for manganese mines in India, using analysis of factors such as age, experience of worker, shift of work, etc.
Results
The outcome of the analysis indicated that skill-based errors are most critical and require immediate attention for mitigation. The FRA-based accident prediction system developed gives an outcome as an indicative risk score associated with the identified accident-prone situation, based upon which a suitable plan for mitigation can be developed.
Conclusion
Unsafe acts of the worker are the most critical human factors identified to be controlled on priority basis. A significant association of factors (namely age, experience of the worker, and shift of work) with unsafe acts performed by the operator is identified based upon which the FRA-based accident prediction model is proposed.}

This paper investigated an order distribution problem in a real case of Iranian's oil and gas industry. In order to overcome the high complexity of the problem, a hybrid approach combining the features of genetic algorithm (GA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is implemented. An improved version of the central coordination system (CCS) is suggested to integrate and process the various input information of the problem. The selected criteria are based on experts’ opinion in the focused section of the industry. In order to obtain the weights of the criteria, a linear model of the Best-Worst method, a recently developed MCDM method, is implemented. Several candidate solutions are obtained from the results of the proposed hybrid method as the first stage of the study. Then, as the second phase, an AHP approach is used to rank the available solutions. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the reliability of the approach. The results indicated the high robustness of the proposed method in dealing with possible changes in the future.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing that returns used products to a like-new condition with equivalent warranty to match is an emerging triple-win (environmental, economic and social) industry. Process planning plays a vital role in the success of remanufacturing. However, compared with traditional mass manufacturing, the design of remanufacturing process planning (RPP) is far more complex and time-consuming, heavily depending on the experiences of operators. Since each returned used product, namely the raw materials for remanufacturing, is different, a customized RPP tackling the individuality of returned used products is essential. To this end, the reuse of remanufacturing knowledge from past successful RPP could lead to efficient generation of new process planning for new arrivals. This paper proposes an ontology-based method for knowledge modelling for RPP rapidly. In this method, (1) remanufacturing-ontology provides a unified framework for the management of information and knowledge from various sources. Especially, the remanufacturing knowledge modelling including problem description and problem solution is constructed via a remanufacturing semantic model; (2) Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) method is applied to reuse the knowledge from the most similar previous successful remanufacturing case for the rapid generation of RPP, leading to considerable time and cost saving. An application program is also presented to realize the proposed method. In addition, a case study of crankshaft remanufacturing is carried out to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.}

Selecting a particular website for network teaching can directly affects end users’ performance and promote network teaching quality. Normally, e-learning website selection can be considered as a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and experts’ evaluations over the performance of e-learning websites are often imprecise and fuzzy due to the subjective nature of human thinking. In this article, we propose a new integrated MCDM approach on the basis of linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets (LHFSs) and the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision making) method to evaluate and select the best e-learning website for network teaching. This introduced method deals with the linguistic assessments of experts based on the LHFSs, determines the weights of evaluation criteria with the best–worst method (BWM), and acquires the ranking of e-learning websites utilizing an extended TODIM method. The applicability and superiority of the presented linguistic hesitant fuzzy TODIM (LHF-TODIM) approach are demonstrated through a realistic e-learning website selection example. Results show that the LHF-TODIM model being proposed is more practical and effective for solving the e-learning website selection problem under vague and uncertain linguistic environment.}

abstract = {As a preventive maintenance technique, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is widely applied to determine and eradicate possible failures. In recent years, many FMEA methods have been developed to address the limitations of traditional FMEA methods in failure mode (FM) assessment, weight calculation, and FM prioritization in complex uncertain environments. However, due to the complexity of equipment, systems, services, etc., there is an inevitable influence on causal relationships between FMs, which is rarely considered by existing methods. Therefore, a novel FMEA method, which integrates the technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy cognitive map (q-ROFCM), is proposed for reasoning the relationships between FMs. The design of the novel method, named q-ROFCM FMEA, involves three stages. The q-ROFS is applied to evaluate the risk factors for capturing more ambiguous information in the first stage. The q-ROFCM is proposed and the causal relationship between FMs is integrated to describe the impact of the relationships on the evaluation results through the dynamic behavior of FMs in the second stage. In the third stage, the TOPSIS method is applied to determine the priority ranking of FMs based on more reliable similarity measurement results of the projection measure. The proposed new method is applied to the FM risk assessment of power units in the railway turnout system. The competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed method have been demonstrated by comparison with other classic methods and sensitivity analysis.}

The main goal of this integration is to simplify the eco-design approach in order to make it accessible to European small medium enterprises (SMEs). All activities are part of a European Community (EC) project called REMake. The proposed method consists of a preliminary scan of a given product or process in order to disclose all involved flows of material and energy, and to assess its environmental impact by means of traditional LCA indexes. The hot points of the process are then identified adding to classical LCA criteria a brand new index, called the “IFR index”, conceived from the TRIZ “Ideal System” concept. Once key points are identified, a set of 330 eco-design guidelines are introduced to develop alternatives and modifications to the given system with the aim of providing a lower global environmental impact. A first version of those guidelines [3,8, and 9] was conceived starting from the eight natural Laws of Evolution of Technical System (LTSE) introduced by Altshuller [10]. Here an extended version allows the user to work in each phase of the product life cycle, and integrates other TRIZ tools and best eco-practices. Preliminary results of the application in SMEs will be presented with a case study concerning a textile home-furnishings and bed linen painting company.}

abstract = {Objective:
The aims of this work were to characterize ambulatory patients in the United States presenting with primary or secondary insomnia complaints and resultant diagnoses, and to describe the characteristics of patients treated with medications commonly used for sleep complaints.
Methods:
Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 1997 through 2002 were analyzed. Data were stratified by patient characteristics, physician specialty, resulting diagnosis, and medications prescribed or provided. The unit of analysis was the individual patient visit; statistical comparisons were made using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Rao-Scott design-adjusted χ2 test for comparisons of patient age groups. P<0.05 was the criterion for statistical significance. Cells containing < 30 observations were not included in the statistical analysis.
Results:
The data included 147,945 patient visit records; rates of physician response to the survey ranged from 62.9% in 1999 to 70.4% in 2002. Based on this sample, it was projected that 30 million office visits involved insomnia complaints over the 6-year period from 1997 to 2002 throughout the United States. With a total of 4.9 billion physician visits projected for that time period, 0.6% of visits were insomnia related. Women were 1.5 times more likely to have insomnia-related visits (P<0.001). Overall, the greatest proportion of insomnia patients of both sexes was between the ages of 18 and 64 years (P<0.001). Sleep difficulties were most frequently attributed to organic disorders, depression and/or anxiety, and primary insomnia (55.8%, 27.3%, and 9.8%, respectively; P<0.001). The most frequently prescribed or recommended medications were zaleplon/zolpidem and trazodone (28.5% and 32.0%, respectively; P<0.001). Zaleplon and zolpidem were most frequently used for patients with organic diagnoses and those aged ≤65 years (33.2% and 29.8%; P<0.001).
Conclusions:
Demographics of patients with insomnia and their diagnoses from 1999 to 2002 remained stable, but the use of medications changed predictably as newer agents became available.}

Even if the problem of optimal public expenditures structure was largely debated in literature, especially from a neoclassical perspective, only a few studies have addressed the optimal composition of public expenditure in European developing countries. The findings could be valuable for policy makers, especially when one looks at arbitrary cuts in public expenditures adopted in most of these countries in recent years, as a response to the financial crisis and public debt and deficit crisis. Neither economic theory nor empirical evidence provides clear answers to the question of how the composition of public expenditures affects economic growth. Using regression analysis for data over 1995-2012 for a group of CEE countries, we estimate the correlation between the two types of public expenditures (current and capital) and economic growth. We investigate, using the Armey's model, the optimal levels of current and capital public expenditures which help maximizing economic growth. Comparing to neoclassical model, our estimations show non-optimal composition of public expenditures for the analyzed countries.}

However, the complex nature of cross-organizational collaborations in LCD often leads to conflicts among stakeholders, hindering effective implementation. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a comprehensive method framework for characterizing, evaluating, and improving manufacturers' LCD Conflict Managing Capabilities (LCD-CMC). The study begins by explicating conflicts in LCD and introduces the People-Process-Technology Framework. This framework serves to comprehensively characterize LCD-CMC and to break down the abstract LCD-CMC concept into specific elements in three dimensions. Subsequently, a Maturity Model is developed for quantitatively evaluating LCD-CMC, utilizing a hybrid method integrating Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytical Network Process (ANP). DEMATEL enables the identification and quantification of interrelations among multiple criteria of the LCD-CMC evaluation system, while ANP facilitates the weighting of each criterion based on its significance. Together, these methodologies enable a comprehensive assessment of the maturity level of LCD-CMC. Building upon this foundation, a systematic approach for generating improvement strategies for LCD-CMC is proposed, leveraging the Total Adversarial Interpretive Structure Model (TAISM) to analyze the inter-relations among contributing capability elements. TAISM offers a practical approach to generating robust improvement strategies, ensuring effective and efficient improvements in LCD-CMC over time. Through a case study involving a prominent Chinese machine tool manufacturer, the feasibility and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated, providing valuable insights into potential improvements. Overall, this paper offers valuable insights into managing conflicts in LCD, providing a structured methodology for evaluating and improving LCD-CMC. By leveraging advanced models and methods, it contributes to addressing LCD conflicts and enhancing collaboration in LCD implementation. Furthermore, it contributes to enriching the knowledge of Life-Cycle Design in the context of conflict management, ultimately advancing sustainable production and consumption practices.}

abstract = {Study objective
For out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, authoritative, evidence-based recommendations have been made for regionalization of postarrest care. However, system-wide implementation of these guidelines has not been evaluated. Our hypothesis is that statewide regionalization of postarrest interventions, combined with emergency medical services (EMS) triage bypass, is associated with improved survival and neurologic outcome.
Methods
This was a prospective before-after observational study comparing patients admitted to cardiac receiving centers before implementation of the interventions (“before”) versus those admitted after (“after”). In December 2007, the Arizona Department of Health Services began officially recognizing cardiac receiving centers according to commitment to provide specified postarrest care. Subsequently, the State EMS Council approved protocols allowing preferential EMS transport to these centers. Participants were adults (≥18 years) experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause who were transported to a cardiac receiving center. Interventions included (1) implementation of postarrest care at cardiac receiving centers focusing on provision of therapeutic hypothermia and coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions (catheterization/PCI); and (2) implementation of EMS bypass triage protocols. Main outcomes included discharged alive from the hospital and cerebral performance category score at discharge.
Results
During the study (December 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010), 31 hospitals were recognized as cardiac receiving centers statewide. Four hundred forty patients were transported to cardiac receiving centers before and 1,737 after. Provision of therapeutic hypothermia among patients with return of spontaneous circulation increased from 0% (before: 0/145; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0% to 2.5%) to 44.0% (after: 300/682; 95% CI 40.2, 47.8). The post return of spontaneous circulation catheterization PCI rate increased from 11.7% (17/145; 95% CI 7.0, 18.1) before to 30.7% (210/684; 95% CI 27.3, 34.3) after. All-rhythm survival increased from 8.9% (39/440) to 14.4% (250/1,734; adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.22; 95% CI 1.47 to 3.34). Survival with favorable neurologic outcome (cerebral performance category score=1 or 2) increased from 5.9% (26/439) to 8.9% (153/1,727; aOR=2.26 [95% CI 1.37, 3.73]). For witnessed shockable rhythms, survival increased from 21.4% (21/98) to 39.2% (115/293; aOR=2.96 [95% CI 1.63, 5.38]) and cerebral performance category score=1 or 2 increased from 19.4% (19/98) to 29.8% (87/292; aOR=2.12 [95% CI 1.14, 3.93]).
Conclusion
Implementation of a statewide system of cardiac receiving centers and EMS bypass was independently associated with increased overall survival and favorable neurologic outcome. In addition, these outcomes improved among patients with witnessed shockable rhythms.}

abstract = {In the globally competitive market landscape, companies, in order to remain sustainable, must shift their focus towards constantly improving their PSS offerings by incorporating lean thinking approaches. PSS are complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional systems, which are supported by appropriate infrastructure and networks. At the same time, PSS require robust engineering methods and tools for their design, which allow multi-dimensional exchange of knowledge between the designers and the relevant stakeholders across the value chain. Currently, enabling technologies such as Cloud technology, social media and networking, knowledge management, and context sensitivity present new possibilities to enhance the knowledge exchange and the collaborative process of PSS design. These technologies allow the gathering and analysis of big volumes of data from scattered heterogeneous IT systems and, at the same time, allow PSS design improvements by processing the experiences of the business customers, consumers, designers, shop-floor, and provide feedback to the design phase. However, a number of challenges are encountered during the gathering, visualization, monitoring, and assessment of related data, such as the lack of context sensitivity. Simultaneously, PSS evaluation approaches are still immature and there is limited work that correlates the impact of the entire PSS lifecycle with the performance assessment of the PSS design. The present work includes a review of the aforementioned technologies from academic, market, and industrial perspectives. Based on an extensive literature review and on constructive discussions with three European SMEs, several barriers and limitations of adopting the aforementioned technologies in practice are identified.

abstract = {Background
This study contributes to the integration of smart product service systems (smart PSSs) for remote patient monitoring (RPM). Integrating smart PSSs into RPM improves service delivery by enabling personalized care plans and shaping a patient-centered workflow for intelligent RPM. However, a gap exists in identifying intelligent RPM attributes and understanding their interrelationships. In addition, prior studies of RPM have yielded mixed results, with some studies demonstrating positive impacts and others showing no effect or even negative consequences on patient health. This inconsistency highlights the need for further investigation into how RPM systems are designed and utilized.
Objectives
First, the proposed intelligent RPM development criteria are validated through a qualitative assessment. Second, the interrelationships among intelligent RPM attributes are analyzed. Finally, the driving factors of intelligent RPM development are identified.
Methods
A hybrid methodology that combines the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL), and an analytical network process (ANP) is introduced to establish a hierarchical model of intelligent RPM attributes. Thirty healthcare industry experts specializing in chronic disease management participated in the study. Linguistic variables were utilized to manage the uncertainty inherent in expert opinions.
Results
The cause group encompassed operational efficiency, enhanced analytics, and sustainable service management, whereas the effect group comprised patient satisfaction and platform technology. The driving criteria included personalized treatment plans, real-time monitoring, mobile app development, and accessibility.
Conclusion
This study advances the understanding of how smart PSSs can be integrated into healthcare delivery. The developed hierarchical framework provides a roadmap for healthcare providers to implement and optimize intelligent RPM systems.}

abstract = {The increasingly competitive markets of the 1990s are generally perceived to be demanding higher-quality and higher-performing products, in shorter and more predictable development cycle-times, and at lower cost. Product development must therefore increasingly be managed as a concurrent, multi-disciplinary process. In terms of the manufacturing function and suppliers this is reflected in recommendations for the formal representation and active involvement of both manufacturing and suppliers on project teams, and a strategic approach to suppliers based on partnership sourcing arrangements and supplier development programmes. However, findings of a recent research study of the UK electrical and mechanical engineering sector, involving comparative analysis and benchmarking against a model of best practice of 12 in-depth case studies, followed by an interview survey of 46 companies, has shown that the diversity in the competitive environment and the characteristics of companies, their strategic policies, and their development projects, give rise to different requirements vis-à-vis the roles of manufacturing and suppliers in product innovation. Also, the study has shown that some features of `best-practice’ are inappropriate to some companies operating in the low-volume industries. It is concluded that, rather than adopt a prescriptive model of `best-practice', companies need to develop procedures which more adequately reflect their inherent needs and the types of project they undertake.}

Our new approach comprises of the following stages: estimating and representing missing and incomplete data; estimating intervals for the criteria used in analyzing data; mapping data on criteria to a common scale; modeling interval data using interval belief structure; and aggregating evidence and ranking customer voices using the interval evidential reasoning algorithm. We demonstrate our approach using a case study from automotive domain with a given criteria hierarchy for analyzing data from three different surveys. We propose new optimization formulations for estimating intervals of the criteria used in our case study and logical yet pragmatic transformation functions for mapping criteria values to a common scale.}

Before adopting this technology in production processes and benefiting from its advantages, manufacturers need to analyze the investment. Therefore, this study aims to develop a decision-making framework for cobot adoption, incorporating a comprehensive set of quantitative and qualitative criteria, to be used by decision-makers in manufacturing companies. To achieve that objective, a qualitative study was conducted by collecting data through interviews with key actors in the cobot (or advanced manufacturing technologies) adoption decision process in manufacturing companies. The main findings of this study include, firstly, an extensive list of decision criteria, as well as some indicators to be used by decision-makers, some of which are new to the literature. Secondly, a decision-making framework for cobot adoption is proposed, as well as a set of guidelines to use it. The framework is based on a weighted scoring method and can be customizable by the manufacturing company depending on its specific context, needs, and resources. The main contribution of this study consists in assisting decision-makers of manufacturing companies in performing more complete and sustained decision analyses regarding cobots adoption.}

Thereby, with the analysis of quantitative empirical papers related to diffusion and adoption of methods, techniques and tools for innovation, we intend to present a portrait of the empirical research on the topic. The analyzed papers were obtained through a systematic survey on two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. It resulted on a corpus of 18 publications, from which main papers, authors, countries and journals that most published about the theme and the most common keywords were identified. Later, the analysis of papers generated an overview of quantitative empirical research related to the topic and indicated areas for further study, contributing to the development of the subject. The study identified the scarcity of research related to the theme of diffusion and adoption of MTT-I and the concentration of quantitative empirical researches in product development, rather than in other results of innovation, such as services and processes. Methodological variations between studies were also identified, making it impossible to compare different contexts.

Approximately one-third of the 35 sediment samples contained measurable pyrethroids. Bifenthrin was the pyrethroid of greatest concern with regards to aquatic life toxicity, consistent with prior studies elsewhere. Toxicity to Hyalella azteca and/or Chironomus dilutus was found in two sediment samples at standard testing temperature (23 °C), and in one additional sample at a more environmentally realistic temperature (13 °C). Given the temperature dependency of pyrethroid toxicity, low temperatures typical of northwest streams can increase the potential for toxicity above that indicated by standard testing protocols.}

abstract = {In the rapidly changeable market, radical innovation (RI) is highly demanded by enterprises to improve their product competitiveness. Enterprises need to efficiently generate ideal radical concepts for the successful implementation of RI. However, the existing research on RI mainly focuses on identifying radical concepts through various evaluation methods from the perspective of business and management. This is a post-hoc analysis, which limits the guidance for enterprises to plan and purposefully generate radical concepts from an ex-ante perspective. For the development of RI products in the engineering field, enterprises lack an effective method for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic method for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts according to the technological evolution. An identification method for radical technology opportunities is proposed based on the evolutionary characteristics of the RI technological trajectory. Technological evolution laws and artificial neural networks are used to determine the evolution direction of subsystems for RI, thereby identify the search direction of new technologies. This paper also establishes a technical knowledge evaluation method and an analogy process for the ex-ante generation of radical concepts. The proposed method is applied in the ex-ante design of a DC charging pile for its feasibility and effectiveness. The proposed method not only provides an efficient ex-ante generation process of the radical concept for enterprise engineers, but also has the potential to enrich research on the RI and knowledge innovation.}

Globally, approximately one billion people live in informal settlements and are exposed to these fires. This paper presents a fire spread experiment between two dwellings, built with ISO 9705 dimension as an approximation of an ISD and separated by 1 m. The fire development and fire spread mechanisms within and between the ISDs were investigated and benchmarked against an independent single dwelling experiment with identical boundary conditions. Parameters, such as mass loss rate of fuel, total heat release rate, gas temperatures, wall and roof temperatures, and gas velocity at the openings were measured, as well as external incident heat fluxes. A comparison between the single and double dwelling experimental results are made. It was established that the existence of the adjacent dwelling, which changes the dynamics of initial burning stage of the wood cribs in dwelling, delayed the flashover of the burning dwelling by more than 150 s (Dwelling 1). The fire spread from dwelling to dwelling that is perpendicular to the plane of the openings is hypothetically concerned with wall collapse or large flame ejections from the burning cardboard linings, rather than the radiation from the heated metal wall, with recorded fluxes of 35, 20, and 5 kW/m2, respectively. Due to the very thin-walls with high conductivity and natural leakage in ISDs, current theories for temperatures, heat release rates, flame shapes, and flashover conditions, based on thermally thick-walled dwellings, do not replicate the data well. A new fire spread model between dwellings, based on accumulated energy, is proposed in this work and conservatively under-predicts the time to ignition by 9 % for this experiment.}

Based on this, this paper explores the research path from traditional product service system (PSS) to smart product service system (SPSS), and then to smart product lifecycle service system (SPLSS), which can endow the products with intelligent perception, intelligent analysis and intelligent decision-making capabilities based on Industrial Internet Platform (IIP). A reference model of IIP enabled SPLSS for industrial services based on system engineering method and theory from a very detailed practical investigation is proposed. Moreover, on the basis of this model, its three dimensional subsystems are expanded, including: supporting environment subsystem, evolution path subsystem, and added value subsystem. The study can provide a reference for the enterprise's manufacturing strategy and manufacturing path. It will promote the transformation and upgrading of enterprise manufacturing model to improve service efficiency and reduce operating costs, and then realize the value-added of products and services.}
