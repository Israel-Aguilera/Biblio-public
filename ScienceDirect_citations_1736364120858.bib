The definition of criteria and the calculation of their weight are central in this method to assess the alternatives. However, there are few studies that focus on them. The purpose of this study is to develop a systematic review of literature on the real cases that applied AHP to evaluate how the criteria are being defined and measured. In the 33 cases selected, they mainly used literature to build the criteria and AHP or Fuzzy AHP to calculate their weight, while other techniques were used to evaluate alternatives.}

The research approach begins with a literature review in design reuse and requirements management to identify appropriate methods within each domain. A framework is proposed based on the identified requirements. The framework is then demonstrated using a case study example: vacuum pump design. Requirements are presented as a component of the integrated design knowledge framework. The proposed framework enables the application of requirements management as a dynamic process, including capture, analysis and recording of requirements. It takes account of the evolving requirements and the dynamic nature of the interaction between requirements and product structure through the various stages of product development.}

In this paper, to handle ambiguity and fuzziness in supplier selection problem effectively, a new weighted additive fuzzy programming approach is developed. Firstly, linguistic values expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of the factors. By applying the distances of each factor between Fuzzy Positive Ideal Rating and Fuzzy Negative Ideal Rating, weights are obtained. Then applying suppliers’ constraints, goals and weights of the factors, a fuzzy multi-objective linear model is developed to overcome the selection problem and assign optimum order quantities to each supplier. The proposed model is explained by a numerical example.}

Select, Map and Measure were illustrated. The selected process was analyzed and four main activities were identified. These were broken down into smaller sub activities and subsequently categorized into value adding and non-value adding activities. Sustainable manufacturing indicator repository (SMIR by National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States of America) was used as a guideline to establish the measurable indicators for each sustainability pillar at each mapped activities. The score for each combination of main activity-sustainable indicator was then determined. The methodology for the Relative Assessment of Building Solutions (MARS-SC) was adapted to facilitate sustainability assessment. Besides the sustainable scores, the future work and the challenges of implementing the SdVSM framework were listed in this paper.}

Hence, the second-hand chemical tanker vessel selection may present many advantages and opportunities to the shipping companies. However, selecting a suitable chemical tanker represents a complicated process requiring overcoming many ambiguities and considering many conflicting criteria. For this purpose, the current paper proposes a new and integrated MCDM approach based on Type-2 Neutrosophic fuzzy sets. The proposed model combines the advantages of TOPSIS and WASPAS techniques, and it uses Type-2 Neutrosophic fuzzy sets to process the uncertainties. The proposed model was applied to solve decision-making problems in selecting appropriate second-hand chemical tankers among 15 alternatives to show effectivity, pertinence, and robustness. In the current paper, 14 different selection criteria were identified to evaluate the chemical tanker vessels. According to the results, C13″ Maintenance cost” is the most significant factor, and A3 is the best and most preferable chemical tanker. Also, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the validity and applicability of the suggested model, and the sensitivity analysis approves the applicability, robustness, and validity of the model.}

Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Industrial case studies are included in this paper to show how this methodology can help in the design of an effective PHM system.}

But the process is lacking of service abilities if a customer wants to modify the given information due to a change in circumstances, albeit such a change is easily caused due turbulent economic situations and long spans in real-estate development projects. Hence the customer perspective regarding the construction management (CM) process should be accommodated better. In this paper, the case studies of the four premises improvement projects are reported upon, where the CM process was altered to include and apply the concepts of continuous improvement and co-creation. The process documentation covered the impacts of the case project on the usability of the premises, the indoor climate conditions (carbon dioxide and temperature) metering, the time lapse cameras and the on-line user feedback system. The documentation consists of the minutes of the meetings, the financial reporting and the time tables.Both the processes and the results of the projects are analysed. Based on the key findings, some suggestions are put forth upon how to improve the CM process to better serve customer interests and quality improvement in the future.}

For this purpose, a novel process and resource selection approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) is developed in order to investigate simultaneously the manufacturability and the accuracy issues in AM process selection. The proposed approach is presented by an IDEF0 activity model to create the context in which data requirements and data flows are defined for the selection. The preliminary process planning content of this approach covers traditional and AM process selection problem, where the decision maker has to select the most appropriate technology to manufacture the desired product. The following steps will be devoted to AM process planning. Therefore, the most appropriate alternative for fabrication with AM is selected by investigating the criteria as resource specifications and manufacturability analysis, as well as accuracy performance. This evaluation system has been applied as a step-by-step methodology that employs well-known procedures, such as screening, comparative assessment, and ranking process to select the most suitable alternative for production with AM. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated by an industrial case study, and it provides a DfAM guideline for engineers and researchers in the early phase of the product development process.}

RPP can be installed on the equipment and it has the prognostic capabilities to convert the data into performance-related information. The equipment performance information can then be integrated into the enterprise asset management system for maintenance decision making through the Internet. Two industrial cases are used to validate the effectiveness of applying the RPP for different prognostic applications as well as the reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed RPP.}

abstract = {Evaluating conceptual design alternatives in a new product development (NPD) environment has been one of the most critical issues for many companies which try to survive in the fast-growing world markets. Therefore, most companies have used various methods to successfully carry out this difficult and time-consuming evaluation process. Of these methods, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been widely used in multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. But, in this study, we used analytical network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, instead of AHP due to the fact that AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies and feedback between higher and lower level elements. Furthermore, in some cases, due to the vagueness and uncertainty on the judgments of a decision-maker, the crisp pairwise comparison in the conventional ANP is insufficient and imprecise to capture the right judgments of the decision-maker. Therefore, a fuzzy logic is introduced in the pairwise comparison of ANP to make up for this deficiency in the conventional ANP, and is called as fuzzy ANP. In short, in this paper, a fuzzy ANP-based approach is proposed to evaluate a set of conceptual design alternatives developed in a NPD environment in order to reach to the best one satisfying both the needs and expectations of customers, and the engineering specifications of company. In addition, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.}

This research addresses this question as it relates to project content, project leadership, and aspects of design integration. Research data were drawn from a survey of 131 completed NPD projects from firms representing a wide variety of manufacturing industries. The results of an analysis of both intentionally accelerated and normally-paced projects suggest that project acceleration interacts with project content, leadership, and integration variables to affect on-time performance differently across NPD project types, sometimes in surprising ways. Two primary effects are posited to explain these inconsistent effects. First, NPD acceleration tends to increase the difficulty of the project by introducing new procedures and by reducing schedule slack. These changes are thought to exacerbate project content factors and to raise the value of NPD leadership and integration techniques. At the same time, an intentional acceleration strategy is thought to signal increased priority for the project, causing development personnel to make more careful decisions, and to more effectively implement new technologies and techniques. The article discusses the implications of the findings for future research and practice.}

abstract = {Conceptual design evaluation plays a crucial role in new product development (NPD) and determines the quality of downstream design activities. Currently, most existing methods focus on fuzzy quantitative the evaluation information of multi-objectives in conceptual schemes selection. However, the above process ignores the various customers' preferences for each scheme under the evaluation objective, causing inconsistent preference weights in the various schemes, which cannot guarantee the market value of the optimal scheme. Furthermore, the ambiguous attitude from experts in the early design stage is not well taken into account. To this end, a conceptual scheme decision model with considering diverse customer preference distribution based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) is proposed. The model is divided into three parts. Firstly, the initial decision matrix of multi-experts concerning the qualitative and quantitative design attributes is constructed based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and then the IFS decision matrix with interval boundaries is formed by using rough set technology. Secondly, the mapping model of design attribute to customer preference is constructed, and then the demand preference strategy implied by design attribute is judged. Thirdly, based on the demand preference strategy, the preferences’ weights for each scheme are calculated. Next, integrating the evaluation data with the same preference in the scheme, the comprehensive satisfaction of the scheme is obtained through IVIFS weighted aggregation operator, and then the optimal scheme is decided. Eventually, a case study of mobile phone form feature schemes is further employed to verify the proposed decision model, and results are sensitivity analyzed and compared.}

Lots of decision-making techniques have been developed for the design concept evaluation under various contexts. However, existing methods mainly focus on the evaluation under precise environments or fuzzy set scenarios. Whereas in reality, most risk assessments are derived from experts’ subjective judgments. The reliability of the evaluation is rarely taken into consideration. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a rough-Z-number-enhanced MCGDM (multi-criteria group decision-making) to resolve the design concept evaluation considering information reliability, uncertainty, and subjectivity. A rough-Z-number is introduced to incorporate into the MCGDM framework to represent the individual evaluation and aggregate group risk assessments. A rough-Z-number-based AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is presented to determine the criteria weights. A rough-Z-number-based MABAC (multi-attributive border approximation area comparison) is proposed to rank the design concepts. Experiments and comparative analyses demonstrate the advantage of the rough-Z-number extended MCGDM in complex and uncertain decision-making environments. With the rough-Z-number-based enhancement, the information reliability, uncertainty, and subjectivity in design concept evaluation are well characterized.}

Calcium and magnesium scale causes problems in various industrial operations such as reverse osmosis unit, heating unit of multi-stage flash distillation, concentration operation of copper-molybdenum mining industry, cooling water system of power generation industry, and water injection operation of oil and gas production. In general terms, scaling affects the operation performance that leads to increased production, as well as maintenance costs. The pH control, scale inhibitors, and nanofiltration membrane have been implemented by industrial operations to control scale. However, the drawbacks of these technologies may force to seek alternative technologies which could be potential alternatives for scale control. This paper discusses the problems of calcium and magnesium scale affecting various industrial operations when seawater is used. It presents current technologies for scale control such as pH control, scale inhibitors, and nanofiltration. Moreover, the technology assessment (TA) was made to evaluate existing and emerging scale control approaches in the case of reverse osmosis (RO) process. The identification of the emerging technologies of scale control has been performed using bibliometric analysis. The comparison of the technologies was made using House of Quality (HOQ) matrix. The identified emerging technologies are: bioelectrochemical system, biomineralization, biosorbent, microbial desalination cells, step by step deposition and extraction technique, carbon dioxide as a precipitator, gas hydrate, ultrasonic crystallization, and capacitive deionization. The comparison of the technologies has shown that nanofiltration, as a common technology, could be an appropriate approach to ensure feasibility and efficiency of RO process, while emerging technology, microbial desalination cells, could become a potential alternative in the future.}

Among these industries, the textile industry, medical industry, iron and steel industry, and agriculture industry have played a pivotal role in all industrial revolutions. This study offers a comprehensive framework for selecting one of these industries for future development, examining their roles in shaping the industrial landscape of the future through the Superiority and Inferiority Ranking Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach. The objective is to establish a Triple Vague framework on T- Spherical fuzzy sets for industry selection in the Industrial Revolution decision-making process. A comparative analysis was conducted with the proposed Decision-Making framework against other methods such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, the Grey Relational Analysis method, and the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed structure highlights its effectiveness in addressing issues like hesitation, vagueness, and other undesirable characteristics. This underscores its significance in providing decision-makers with valuable insights for a thorough assessment and selection of optimal alternatives.

It has yielded great results and proven to be a key driver for quality improvement using Six Sigma strategy. Design for Six Sigma uses an organized methodology for designing new products and processes using statistical tools to minimize defects and process deviations. Modern manufacturing technologies such as Additive Manufacturing are complex and require a lot of consideration in terms of selected process parameters that affect part quality. The quality of the resultant parts in additive manufacturing is influenced and affected by the design of the parts to be fabricated, the build process and the chosen process parameters. Quality deviations in additive manufacturing can be observed within a batch of similar parts and from batch to batch production. Due to the complexity of Additive Manufacturing technology and its application, defect reduction remains a key barrier towards further acceptance in highly regulated industries. This paper aims to evaluate the applicability of design for Six Sigma principle to Additive Manufacturing. It seeks to outline how Design for Six Sigma can be applied to Additive Manufacturing to reduce variability and which tools can be used to enhance the quality of the resultant parts.

Community gardens can reduce public health disparities through promoting physical activity and healthy eating, growing food for underserved populations, and accelerating healing from injury or disease. Despite their potential to contribute to comprehensive patient care, no prior studies have investigated the prevalence of community gardens affiliated with US healthcare institutions, and the demographic characteristics of communities served by these gardens.
Methods
In 2013, national community garden databases, scientific abstracts, and public search engines (e.g., Google Scholar) were used to identify gardens. Outcomes included the prevalence of hospital-based community gardens by US regions, and demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, and obesity rates) of communities served by gardens.
Results
There were 110 healthcare-based gardens, with 39 in the Midwest, 25 in the South, 24 in the Northeast, and 22 in the West. Compared to US population averages, communities served by healthcare-based gardens had similar demographic characteristics, but significantly lower rates of obesity (27% versus 34%, P<.001).
Conclusions
Healthcare-based gardens are located in regions that are demographically representative of the US population, and are associated with lower rates of obesity in communities they serve.}

abstract = {Conceptual design plays an important role in development of new products and redesign of existing products. Morphological matrix is a popular tool for conceptual design. Although the morphological-matrix based conceptual design approaches are effective for generation of conceptual schemes, quantitative evaluation to each of the function solution principle is seldom considered, thus leading to the difficulty to identify the optimal conceptual design by combining these function solution principles. In addition, the uncertainties due to the subjective evaluations from engineers and customers in early design stage are not considered in these morphological-matrix based conceptual design approaches. To solve these problems, a systematic decision making approach is developed in this research for product conceptual design based on fuzzy morphological matrix to quantitatively evaluate function solution principles using knowledge and preferences of engineers and customers with subjective uncertainties. In this research, the morphological matrix is quantified by associating the properties of function solution principles with the information of customer preferences and product failures. Customer preferences for different function solution principles are obtained from multiple customers using fuzzy pairwise comparison (FPC). The fuzzy customer preference degree of each solution principle is then calculated by fuzzy logarithmic least square method (FLLSM). In addition, the product failure data are used to improve product reliability through fuzzy failure mode effects analysis (FMEA). Unlike the traditional FMEA, the causality relationships among failure modes of solution principles are analyzed to use failure information more effectively through constructing a directed failure causality relationship diagram (DFCRD). A fuzzy multi-objective optimization model is also developed to solve the conceptual design problem. The effectiveness of this new approach is demonstrated using a real-world application for conceptual design of a horizontal directional drilling machine (HDDM).}

The fuzzy Delphi method, which can lead to better criteria selection, is used to modify previous studies to construct the hierarchy. Considering the interdependence among the selection criteria in the hierarchy, ANP is then used to obtain the weights of the criteria. To avoid calculation and additional pairwise comparisons of ANP, TOPSIS is used to rank the alternatives. According to the hierarchy based on three perspectives and 12 important criteria, optimal locations for Taiwanese service apartments can be more effectively selected. Moreover, by integrating the fuzzy Delphi method, ANP, and TOPSIS, this study can make better decisions for optimal locations. To illustrate how the fuzzy Delphi method, ANP, and TOPSIS are applied in the location selection problem, their application to a real case is also performed.}

abstract = {Reducing the ecological footprint of the machine tool is one of the great challenges in terms of the global sustainable development goals. Eco-design of the machine tool is now regarded as one of the effective methods to reduce the environmental pollution from the source. This paper proposes an ecological sensitivity analysis method enabling ranking of the alternative eco-design measures in a time efficient way regarding the life-cycle environmental impact to support eco-design decision making of machine tool. Based on the presented frameworks and procedures, the potential ecological improvement measures can be identified and the ecological improvement potentials of these measures with various options could be quantified. Realization of this method is analyzed by a case study of gear hobbing machine. The goal of this paper is expected to give a complementary support for decision-making on eco-design of the machine tool.}

One construct that has remained largely unexplored in explaining visitors' perceived safety while at the destination is their level of emotional solidarity (positive sentiments one feels for another) with destination residents. The purpose of this paper is to examine tourists' perceived safety in two popular tourism destinations in Texas along the Mexico–U.S. border (i.e., the Lower Rio Grande Valley and the Big Bend area) and investigate the extent to which tourists' emotional solidarity with residents predicts their perceptions of safety. Perceptions of safety were higher among visitors to the Big Bend area than they were among visitors to the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Also, visitors high in emotional solidarity (particularly to a dimension pertaining to feeling welcomed) also perceived the tourism destination as relatively safe. Theoretical and practical implications are provided.}

To fill this academic lacuna, this paper proposes a method for evaluating such concepts that focuses on their acceptability to customers. The proposed approach is based on customer perceptions of value throughout the customer experience cycle: customers’ acceptability results from their comparison of new PSS concepts with existing products. This approach successfully employs the analytic network process and niche theory to quantify customers’ perceptions of their experience of PSSs. A short case study shows the usefulness of the proposed approach, which is expected to aid manufacturers adopting PSS strategies.}

The number of companies that are enlarging their offer portfolio looking forward to new and increased sources of revenues is always increasing but the number of companies failing in successfully implementing servitization strategy is even more. One possible reason behind this is the lack of tools to support companies while dealing with services that by definition are characterized by high level of intangibility and perishability. The Service Engineering (SE) discipline that is currently working for an integrated development of tools and methodologies specifically related to services is still under development and the existing methodologies are more oriented to the manufacturing context. In the SE context Pezzotta et al., in 2014 suggested the SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) for the engineering and the re-engineering of new service or Product-Service System (PSS) helping the companies in balancing their internal performance with the service value perceived by the customer. This paper aims at understanding the industrial applicability of such methodology. It presents a real case study carried out in collaboration with ABB Spa, a leading provider in power and automation technology. In the paper, all the steps performed during the application of the SEEM are described, together with the difficulties encountered. Some insights obtained with the application are also described.}

For this reason, the present study was conducted with consideration of two dimensions of resilience enhancer and resilience reducer to select and segment suppliers. The Grey DEMATEL technique was used to determine the importance degree of the criteria for each of these two dimensions, and then, using Grey Simple Additive Weighting technique (GSAW), the score of each supplier was determined according to each dimension. Based on the findings, customization was known the most important enhancer criterion and the supplier's capacity limit was the most significant reducer. Finally, vulnerable, sensitive, volatile and resilient suppliers were identified in accordance with the suppliers' score in both enhancer and reducer dimensions, and strategies were also provided for supplier development.}

The components of the framework are to: (1) determine the private, i.e. farmers’, and public benefits associated to agro-landscapes, consisting of an agricultural land-use system, according to its performance for several market and non-market functions. Market forces determine the market benefits and preferences of society the non-market benefits; (2) explore and select potential sustainable agro-landscapes based on the private and public benefits associated with possible land-use alternatives; (3) define efficient public policy mechanisms for improving social net benefit of agro-landscapes. The framework is illustrated with a case study in a small dairy farming dominated agro-landscape in The Netherlands, with gross margin, landscape quality, nature value and environmental health as the analysed ecosystem functions. Alternative landscapes consisting of hedgerow configurations and grassland management practices were explored, yielding a set of alternatives representing the solution space in terms of change in private and public benefits. Policy mechanisms were defined to move from the current to a desired landscape based on changes in social net benefits. Moreover, the necessity of a modification in the current agri-environmental support was analysed for each landscape. The analysis considered all farmers in the agro-landscape jointly. The results for the case study showed potential prototypes of landscapes and their performance compared to the current landscape. Extension was the most efficient policy mechanism to promote the change to the socially optimum landscape alternative.}

This paper aims to contribute to the definition of ‘boundary objects’ that facilitate the sharing of knowledge between members of cross-functional teams engaged in PSS conceptual design activities. Empirical data are gathered from three case studies in the Swedish manufacturing industry to reveal how servitization affects early stage design decision-making, and how hardware vs. service trade-offs are negotiated and solved. The analysis of the findings points to four main trends to be considered when designing such objects in the realm of PSS. These are: an underlying model-based logic, the use of metrics based on customer value, the ability to quickly generate and assess scenarios, the use of non linear relationships to map PSS features vs. customer value.}

abstract = {Due to the growing globalisation and strategic sourcing, supply chains (SCs) are confronted with potential disruptions. Companies need to make further efforts and investments to improve their supply chain resilience (SCR) in becoming more prepared to minimise disruption risks. Sourcing is one of the main, strategic, key factors towards SCR. Also, organisations require resilience in demand fulfilment to handle volatile marketplaces. This paper presents a methodology towards SCR to both supply and demand variations motivated by a real case study of a manufacturing company that works to improve its SCR. To this end, a hybrid integrated multi-attribute decision making-possibilistic bi-objective programming model (MADM-PBOPM) was developed. First, a new framework presenting pillars to assess suppliers’ resilience was developed based on a thorough literature review and decision makers’ input. Then, a DEMATEL-TOPSIS approach was proposed to quantify existing suppliers’ resilience and assess its performance. It also helped in categorising resilience pillars (RPs) as causes and effects. Thereafter, the obtained weights of suppliers and pillars were integrated into the developed PBOPM. The latter helps the purchasing team to (1) order materials from suppliers based on their resilience and performance efficiency; and (2) elevate the company’s resilience to uncertain demands fulfilment. Therefore, the developed methodology can potentially be used by the purchasing teams to build up SCs that are resilient to supply disruption and demand uncertainty. This MADM-PBOPM model was validated as part of the case study investigation. Furthermore, the suppliers’ assessment output was validated by using two sensitivity analysis approaches including criteria weight variation and other multi-attribute decision making (MADM) approaches.}

DS enables multidisciplinary design teams to streamline the requirements definition, alternative generation, analysis, and decision-making processes by providing a methodology for building and managing requirements driven design spaces with parametric Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. DS consists of four interdependent models: (1) Requirements Model – stakeholders and designers explicitly define and prioritize context specific design requirements; (2) Scenarios Model (SM) – designers formally transform these requirements into actions necessary to achieve them, and determine the geometric and material parameters, interrelationships, and potential conflicts; (3) Parametric Process Model (PPM) – CAD experts build and represent the technical implementation of a SM in a parametric model to enable design teams to manage and communicate its CAD models; (4) Alternative Analysis Model – analyze and visually report performance back to the designers and stakeholders. This paper motivates the need for the DS methodology thorough an industry case study, and establishes points of departure for the methodology through literature review. Next, the paper details the elements and methods in the methodology, describes its implementation into a software prototype, provides an illustrative example to explain, and an industry test case to validate how DS can potentially enable multidisciplinary teams to generate and communicate larger and better performing design spaces more efficiently than with traditional methods.}

abstract = {To simulate the behavior of water distribution networks under any supply pressure conditions it is necessary to use head driven models, considering both the leakage and pressure dependent demands. Up to the present, many authors [1], [2], [3] and [4] have proposed different methods to simulate the network behavior considering user's demand and/or leaks depending on pressure, but few of them are ready to be implemented from the practical point of view. With this aim, firstly the authors have analyzed the behavior of demand as a function of pressure (PDD), simulating the response of plumbing systems in different types of buildings in urban areas. Next, a new mathematical function has been proposed that fits the simulated dependence of demands with pressure. This function has the necessary mathematical properties to be integrated within a hydraulic model and its parameters have been adjusted in a specific sector of the Valencia water distribution network, using the field data taken during a four month test. Field data included the sector inflow, pressures at service connections and automated meter readings. On the other hand the authors have developed a procedure to find the leakage coefficients at each node that fit best for the total leakage volume in the sector, usually available in sectored water supply system. Finally the new PDD function and the leakage coefficients have been integrated in a realistic model to consider the dependence of leakage and demands with pressure so that, for any scenario simulation, the integrated model is able to provide in every node the value of pressure and the total consumed flow differentiating its two components, leakage and demand. Using this model, more realistic simulations can be carried out for new scenarios such as pressure reduction for leakage control, failure of critical components (water treatment plant, pumping station, pipe breaks, etc) or restrictions to be applied during an extended drought, in order to analyze in each case the demand satisfaction and leakage level.}

abstract = {In the context of mass personalization, the dynamic and erratic nature of customer requirements (CRs) is increasingly pronounced. Amidst intensifying market competition, enterprises are compelled to swiftly adjust their products to satisfy the ever-changing CRs. However, the complicated design processes often result in prolonged product update and iteration cycles. Thus, it is urgent for enterprises to promote product rapid design, in which, it is essential to map CRs to functional requirements (FRs), then to design parameters (DPs). Traditional mapping methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, struggle to keep pace with the ever-changing CRs. Moreover, enhancing the efficiency of design knowledge management and reuse is imperative for achieving product rapid design. Considering the strengths of knowledge graphs (KGs) in knowledge management and mining, we establish a multi-domain product design KG (MPDKG) including a CR domain, a FR domain, and a DP domain, and facilitate the mapping process by constructing mapping relations between domains. Firstly, CR entities in the CR domain are extracted through a triple-task cascaded CRs identification model from online reviews and complaints. Secondly, FR entities are identified from product functional lists and instructions, and the Sentence-Bert model is employed to establish the mapping relations between CR entities and FR entities. Subsequently, a corpus comprising product design knowledge is constructed and a cross-domain joint entity relation extraction model is developed to extract DP entities and construct their mapping relations with FR entities. Lastly, the multi-domain mapping of BYD Qin is implemented as a case study to elucidate the practical utility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

abstract = {Academic research on E-learning has increased extensively over the past few years. Although, many multi-criteria decision making methods have been proposed to evaluate and examine the effectiveness of E-learning, there is a lack of study concerning systematic literature review and classification of research in this area. Regarding this, five major databases including ScienceDirect, Emerald, Taylor and Francis, IEEE, and Springer have been selected and a systematic methodology proposed. Consequently, a review of 42 published papers appearing in 33 academic journals and international conferences between 2001 and 2015 have been obtained to achieve a comprehensive review of MCDM application in E-learning. Accordingly, the selected papers have been classified by the year of publication, MCDM techniques, and journals and conferences in which they appeared. In addition, the significant criteria in evaluating E-learning were found. This study supports researchers and practitioners in effectively adopting MCDM techniques regarding E-learning evaluation and provides an insight into its state-of-the-art.}

abstract = {Selection of assembly process is one of the important stage of product development which need to tackle at the earlier stage product realization. Selecting the most appropriate joining process needs various assembly joint information (liaison) which includes both the geometric and non-geometric information. To capture, represent, and reuse this information across domains is a highly knowledge-intensive process that necessitates the use of an active artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In this research, an AI tool called ontology-based knowledge framework is used to assist with identifying the best plastic assembly process to effectively support designers and process planners. The methodology for selecting a joining process and developing a knowledge-based framework is described, together with industrial application of the suggested approach is proposed. To express many key concepts like liaison, process, requirement for variant product etc., a joining process selection (JPS) ontology is created. To get the necessary knowledge for process selection that integrates several instances and knowledge rules, ontology mapping of joining method selection concepts is done using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). The suggested method uses rule-based reasoning to automatically infer the best joining methods. Finally, industrial application of the suggested framework is proposed to assess the applicability of this approach.}

Despite of immense potential of sustainable composites in the Circular Economy (CE), its implementation is still insignificant due to the lack of an effective material selection approach. The existence of several influencing aspects in the process of material selection considers it a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In the present work, an Aggregation Operator (AO) based integrated Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Multi-attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) has been proposed to deal with the issues of material selection for polymer based sustainable composites. Moreover, q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROPFNs) have been implemented to tackle the uncertainty in the information. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been confirmed by different comparative and sensitivity investigations. The developed composites have shown excellent properties whereas the responses of the materials vary invariably with compositions. The proposed method has identified the amalgamation of 10 wt percentage of rice husk ash and 10 wt percentage of sand with 80 wt percentage of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as an appropriate material for the development of sustainable floor tiles as the composites resulted to optimum mechanical performances and minimum abrasive wear. The proposed model gives reliable and robust results and is sensitive to the criteria weights and mathematical parameters. The outcome of the research has exposed that the suggested mathematical approach can be effectively applied for material selection of sustainable polymeric composites for different applications.}

Some of the criteria are possibly dependent to each other. This research attempted to apply Analytic Network Process (ANP) to support the decision-making process in the observed company. As ANP does not work optimally in the case where the number of alternatives is large, we performed an initial selection process by employing two criteria as filters to reduce the available alternatives. The process continued by applying ANP to the ten selected criteria from which ranking of each alternative was produced. One-by-one elimination rank was also used as an approach in the analysis. The result has shown that ANP was capable of providing a good and structured decision preview in the decision-making process. Analysis also found that when several alternatives were removed from the calculation, the resulted ranks also changed.}

Though major focus has shifted towards energy minimization, other approaches have churned themselves out as new subjects – cloud computing. Green computing encompasses a wide range of things. One of them is e-waste management. End of life electronic equipments known as e-waste is a threat to the whole world. Globally 41.8 million metric tonnes of e-waste was generated in 2014. These electronic items are the hardware part of the computer. The proper management of e-waste hence leaves a good potential to implement green computing. An overwhelming amount of research articles focusing on green computing are present and major focus is on energy minimization, efficient algorithms and cloud computing. Literature on green computing focusing on e-waste management is scant. The research questions aroused are as follows. Is it actually possible to implement green computing using e-waste management? What are the issues pertaining to it? How can this be achieved? How sustainable it this approach? The study tries to answer these questions. The main objective of this study is to establish e-waste management as a parameter for green computing. The study also intends to check the sustainability potential of this approach.

For a very long time, it was considered as a topic of mere theoretical interest. However, the introduction of several useful definitions of fractional derivatives has extended its domain to applications. Supported by computational power and algorithmic representations, fractional calculus has emerged as a multifarious domain. It has been found that the fractional derivatives are capable of incorporating memory into the system and thus suitable to improve the performance of locality-aware tasks such as image processing and computer vision in general. This article presents an extensive survey of fractional-order derivative-based techniques that are used in computer vision. It briefly introduces the basics and presents applications of the fractional calculus in six different domains viz. edge detection, optical flow, image segmentation, image de-noising, image recognition, and object detection. The fractional derivatives ensure noise resilience and can preserve both high and low-frequency components of an image. The relative similarity of neighboring pixels can get affected by an error, noise, or non–homogeneous illumination in an image. In that case, the fractional differentiation can model special similarities and help compensate for the issue suitably. The fractional derivatives can be evaluated for discontinuous functions, which help estimate discontinuous optical flow. The order of the differentiation also provides an additional degree of freedom in the optimization process. This study shows the successful implementations of fractional calculus in computer vision and contributes to bringing out challenges and future scopes.}

The ability to conduct a voice of the customer analysis, which could be gained through direct and indirect questioning, will enable engineers and other decision makers to successfully understand customer needs, wants, perceptions, and preferences. The information obtained from the customers is then translated into critical targets that will be used to ultimately satisfy the customer requirements. During this research project, different forms of customer input, including qualitative and quantitative data, were transformed to a common data format to develop a correlation between design input requirements and product/service outputs. We have developed a new method for measuring customer satisfaction ratio (CSR) by considering the following: mining both textual and quantitative data, multiple design parameters, mapping output on a scale of 0–1, and a decision template for means of measure. Previous measures of CSR fail to incorporate the cost implication of fixing customer complaints/issues; however, we include this important and unique measure in our research. The implication of this research will reduce Things Gone Wrong (TGW’s) and engineering development time and will achieve improvements in JD Power ratings, quality perception, marketing tools, and customer satisfaction.}

The models represent and integrate four major system views: function, physical structure, end-to-end quantitative performance, and implementation or deployment. In principle, integrated modeling is applicable to general electromechanical and sociotechnical systems.

The qualitative design parameters and design criteria are first deployed with the quality function deployment and failure mode and effect analysis technologies and then quantified with the analytic hierarchy process technology to get the best design targets with which the detail design is completed. The design for assembly technology is also used to analyze the assembly performance and the costs of design alternatives. In this manner, a product that more nearly fits the consumer needs and is of higher competitiveness can be designed and the total quality is managed after the design process has been completed.
Relevance to industry
Developing a high quality and low cost product is an important policy of an enterprise in today's highly competitive marketplace. To reach this objective, a systematically transparent method by integrating several techniques is proposed in this study.

However, online product reviews have provided a good and reliable channel for not only understanding customers needs for one product or service but also analyzing products’ competition in the market. In this paper, we propose a new framework of applying online product reviews to analyze customer preferences for two competitive products. We extract the key topics of online reviews for two specific competitive products via a text mining approach of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Topic difference analysis demonstrates the unique topics of the two products. The relative importance and topic heterogeneity analyses identify the competitive superiorities and weaknesses of both products. Two case studies that are presented demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The method also provides valuable managerial implications for product designers and e-commerce companies.}

abstract = {Complexity in product development (PD) projects can emanate from the product design, the development process, the development organization, the tools and technologies applied, the requirements to be met, and other domains. In each of these domains, complexity arises from the numerous elements and their multitude of relationships, such as between the components of the product being developed, between the activities to develop them, and among the people doing the activities. One approach to handing this complexity is to represent and analyze these domains’ design structures or architectures. The design structure matrix (DSM) has proved to be a very helpful tool for representing and analyzing the architecture of an individual system such as a product, process, or organization. Like many tools, the DSM has been applied in a variety of areas outside its original domain, as researchers and practitioners have sought to leverage its advantages. Along the way, however, its fundamental rules (such as being a square matrix) have been challenged. In this paper, we formalize an approach to using a domain mapping matrix (DMM) to compare two DSMs of different project domains. A DMM is a rectangular (m×n) matrix relating two DSMs, where m is the size of DSM1 and n is the size of DSM2. DMM analysis augments traditional DSM analyses. Our comparison of DSM and DMM approaches shows that DMM analysis offers several benefits. For example, it can help (1) capture the dynamics of PD, (2) show traceability of constraints across domains, (3) provide transparency between domains, (4) synchronize decisions across domains, (5) cross-verify domain models, (6) integrate a domain with the rest of a project or program, and (7) improve decision making among engineers and managers by providing a basis for communication and learning across domains.}

The final concept relates to filled (composite) chocolate that, according to definition, is a chocolate with filling (praliné) covered by chocolate couverture of not less than 15%. The research procedure that consists of the five steps, was developed in association with the House of Quality model. First, the market research was conducted to determine the segment of filled-chocolate consumers. As a result, a target group of people between 20 and 29 years old was found. Second, the behavioural motives of the consumers in the target segment were analysed. Then product objective specifications were established through physico-chemical and instrumental methods. Finally, sensory analyses were performed involving both consumer and trained panels. A few significant correlations between instrumental and sensory scores were established. The last step of research relates to analysis of the mutual relations between technical and sensory measurements and integration of results in the House of Quality matrix. Methodology introduced in this experiment corresponds to the quality function deployment approach; data evaluation—by ANOVA and factor analysis—is implemented. ©}

The objective of this work is to propose a methodology to model the resale value of road compaction equipment using data mining techniques.

abstract = {Submarine pipelines are crucial to the safe and efficient transportation of offshore oil and gas, and conducting risk assessments is pivotal to mitigating the potential hazards associated with submarine pipelines and ensuring their safety. This paper proposes a comprehensive risk assessment model based on the expanded Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) framework by incorporating the gray relational projection method and the compromise ranking method (GRP-VIKOR). The proposed GRP-VIKOR model combines the compromise rationality of VIKOR with the comprehensive indicator relationship evaluation of the gray relational projection method to effectively enhance the reliability and precision of the risk assessments. Initially, the risk structure of submarine pipelines is outlined, and an elaborate one and two-level evaluation index system for submarine pipeline failure risk assessment is established using the expanded FMEA, which ensures the precision and rigor of the risk assessment framework. In the data processing segment of GRP-VIKOR, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are employed to represent expert judgment language, thus augmenting the capability of the model to describe uncertainty. The introduction of the gray relational projection method combines gray correlation numbers with positive and negative ideal solutions, thus addressing deviations in the VIKOR method related to the judgment of alternative solutions with similar degrees of proximity to positive and negative ideal solutions. In the weight assignment segment of GRP-VIKOR, cooperative game theory is utilized, integrating three weight assignment methods to enhance the accuracy of indicator weights, effectively resolving issues associated with the dominance of a single method in the multi-attribute evaluation weight assignment. Finally, the risk priority of failure factors is determined through the analysis of actual submarine pipeline data and comparative analyses of different model results and parameter sensitivities. The experimental results demonstrate that the model accurately analyzes risk priorities, offering effective theoretical support for the field of submarine pipeline safety assessment.}

abstract = {Product-Service System lifecycle is characterized by several phases from the initial concept to the final disposal. However, as for conventional products, the profit generation and the market success of PSSs critically depend on the decisions taken during the initial lifecycle stages, when PSSs are conceptualized, designed, developed and engineered. These are hence the phases deserving more attention in order to manage the intrinsic complexity of such systems, taking it in account during the entire PSS life cycle design phase. According to this, one of the main gaps detected in the PSS design process is the lack of methods able to support the early integration of service features during the product design. In this specific context DfX approaches, where X= x-bility stands for enhancing products design considering at the same time service features to be embedded on it (x) according to certain performance measures (-bility), are supposed to significantly contribute. The Serviceability point of view appears to be a critical aspect of the design of product-oriented PSS that has not been improving yet: significant enhancement in this products’ characteristic will only occur if some changes will arise in the way they are designed. Indeed companies still need guidelines able to enhance the PSS design process in a more systematic way. On this basis, due to the main gap of integrating service features in the product design process, the paper presents and defines DfX approaches enlightening, among the several target properties they have been called to improve so far, the most suitable DfX streams detected to solve the reported PSS design issue and to define Design for Product Service Supportability (DfPSS).}

abstract = {As the consciousness of the global environment and sustainability has increased, low-carbon products have played a vital role in the transformation to a circular economy. Advanced smart design technology has enabled product designers to fulfill customer requirements by offering tailor-made functions and low-carbon solutions. However, although the existing approaches used in the conceptual design process can help in functional reasoning, knowledge modelling, and scheme evaluation, the smart reuse of knowledge, such as in design model improvement and concept scheme iteration for lower carbon emission, the corresponding process evaluation concerning carbon footprint has not been given sufficient attention. To resolve this, in this work, a smart knowledge deployment method is proposed for reasoning, configuring, and optimizing the conceptual scheme (CS) based on carbon emission evaluation and interaction. First, to match discretized knowledge, sub-function requirements after function decomposition are mapped with granular clustered knowledge into a matrix based on a requirement function knowledge deployment (RFKD) model. Second, the derived candidate concept schemes (CCSs) are selected in three steps: conflict-based primaries, configuration, and carbon footprint ranking. Finally, the initial conceptual scheme (ICS) with the lowest carbon emission is used as input for the interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) to better capture a comprehensive set of user feedback on potential candidate schemes through interactions. Accordingly, improvements are completed as intended. The prototype design and an experimental study of a brand-new friction-wear testing machine are conducted. The results suggest that the proposed approach could effectively reduce the carbon emissions of products obtained through CS and improve the convergence of the schemes produced via genetic operation.}

The main aim of this paper is to address this concern and improve the application of MCDM methods by addressing possible fluctuations in the criteria weightings. The recently proposed concept of stratification (CST) is used in conjunction with MCDM methods to stratify the decision environment. The method is then applied to a supplier selection problem.

The proposed Kano-Weighted IPCA (KWIPCA) framework assesses the importance and performance of product attributes by independently weighting positive and negative reviews according to the principles of the Kano model, while also considering multiple competitors in the market. The final output is a user-friendly, four-quadrant matrix that provides comprehensive insights into the market importance of attributes, their relative achievement, and competitors' performance distribution. This KWIPCA matrix enables the evaluation of a product's strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors, identification of critical areas needing immediate improvement, and offers strategic guidance for enhancing overall customer satisfaction. To demonstrate and validate the KWIPCA framework, a case study was conducted using 8567 reviews of 22 five-star hotels in Seoul, South Korea. The results confirm the KWIPCA's effectiveness in providing actionable insights and competitive benchmarking.}

Multi-modal aggregation strategies are applied to aggregate subjective evaluations of both individuals and groups represented in probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs), objective eye movement, and Electroencephalogram feature data. Specifically, a probabilistic linguistic information aggregation operator based on the Choquet integral is proposed to aggregate the values of subjective criteria with correlations, and the double normalization-based multi-aggregation method is then applied to aggregate objective criteria values, which can avoid information loss in the normalization and aggregation. Finally, the Choquet integral-based Borda operator is developed to integrate the evaluation results of multiple subgroups. An example of evaluating intelligent shared vehicle design schemes is presented to validate the proposed method.}

By using a methodological decision analysis in four aspects including decision problems, decision makers, decision environments, and decision approaches, we finally selected and reviewed 123 journal articles. To examine the research trend on uncertain supplier selection, these articles are roughly classified into seven categories according to different uncertainties. Under such classification framework, 26 DM techniques are identified from three perspectives: (1) Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, (2) Mathematical programming (MP) techniques, and (3) Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We reviewed each of the 26 techniques and analyzed the means of integrating these techniques for supplier selection. Our survey provides the recommendation for future research and facilitates knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the application of DM techniques in supplier selection.}

abstract = {Due to rising energy prices and stricter regulations of carbon dioxide emissions, it is not sufficient to optimize energy consumption only during the utilization of products; production has to become more energy efficient, too. In order to reduce the energy demand, energy concerning aspects must be considered early in the development process of the production plants. In these phases, attributes that are responsible for the later energy consumption are predetermined. But the energy demand is often not in focus of the development process. For that reason a methodology for the development of energy efficient production plants is currently being developed by the authors.}

abstract = {In the context of COVID-19 crisis, the Moroccan automotive ecosystem is uncertain and volatile. To survive in this changed environment, automotive organizations should manage effectively their leagile supply chains. This management depends mainly on the identification of the leagile enablers influencing the supply chain. To understand the relationship between these enablers, we used interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach followed by MICMAC analysis. The presentation of a case study from the Moroccan automotive industry illustrates this approach. As a result, we classified enablers according to their driving and dependence power. This classification helps supply chain managers to improve supply chain leagility and performance in order to meet quickly the changed customer needs.}

abstract = {Summary
The prevalence of sarcoidosis in the United States is unknown, with estimates ranging widely from 1 to 40 per 100,000. We sought to determine the prevalence of sarcoidosis in our health system compared to other rare lung diseases and to further establish if the prevalence was changing over time. We interrogated the electronic medical records of all patients treated in our health system from 1995 to 2010 (1.48 million patients) using the common ICD9 codes for sarcoidosis (135), lung cancer (162), and several other lung diseases characterized, like sarcoidosis, as “rare lung diseases”. The patient demographic information (race, gender, age) was further analyzed to identify signature data patterns. The prevalence of sarcoidosis in our health system increased steadily from 164/100,000 in 1995 to 330/100,000 in 2010, and this trend could not be ascribed simply to changes in patient demographics or patient referral patterns. We further estimate that the prevalence of sarcoidosis exceeds 48 per 100,000 in Franklin County, Ohio, the demographic profile of which is nearly identical to that of the U.S. Sarcoidosis prevalence increased over time relative to lung cancer, a benchmark disease with stable disease prevalence, and exceeded that of other rare lung diseases. We postulate that the observed 2-fold increase in sarcoidosis disease prevalence in our health system is primarily related to improved detection and diagnostic approaches, and we conclude that the actual prevalence of sarcoidosis in central Ohio greatly exceeds current U.S. estimates.}

abstract = {The increasing data availability in production processes combined with open source software tools in the field of machine learning (ML) lead to a new level of process improvement possibilities. For many companies, the challenge is now to identify potential use cases with considerable business impact by integrating ML techniques in production processes. Especially hands-on approaches, which provide a structured guideline through the process with concrete tools, are missing. Therefore, this paper presents the smart use case picking approach DUCAR, which consists of five phases. The first phase is the definition of the ML use case domain followed by the understanding of potential processes and process steps in the second phase. In the third phase, use case ideas are collected based on the gained knowledge. After the analysis and selection of the most promising use cases in the fourth phase, the final fifth phase focuses the realization of these use cases to successfully integrate ML in production processes. To validate the DUCAR approach, the field of electronics production is used as an example.}

Based on a review of the literature, this study has identified, analysed, and synthesised module drivers into an extensive set of module drivers. Taking outset in the value chain concept, this study identified 68 individual module drivers grouped into 29 module driver categories spanning 6 value chain steps.}

This paper presents a design framework to analyze online product reviews. The objective is to use this machine-generated data to identify a series of customer needs. The framework aims to distill large volumes of qualitative data into quantitative insights on product features, so that designers can make more informed decisions. The framework combines the elements of online product reviews, design theory and methodology, and data analytics to reveal new insights. The effectiveness of the proposal framework is validated through a case study on product reviews from the e-commerce website, Amazon. The framework demonstrates a statistical approach for analyzing online product reviews. The framework acts as an interface between quantitative outputs and the qualitative and creative process of design. Further analysis of results identifies many of incorporating logical, computational methods into the highly subjective and creative process of design.}

Analyzing and evaluating service quality provides potential insights into the directions for future advances in recreational fisheries. This study established 16 attributes of five dimensions based on the SERVQUAL (Service Quality) method to measure the service quality of recreational fisheries. From the perspective of tourists, we developed an evaluation system of the recreational fishery service quality of Shengshan Island and Lianjiang County in China, based on the fuzzy Kano model and importance-performance analysis. Research results identified similarities and significant differences in the quality of recreational fishery services in the two regions. On the one hand, in terms of transportation, infrastructure, project prices, and product prices, their service quality performs satisfactorily; on the other hand, the recreational fishery of Shengshan Island exhibited a higher development level than that of Lianjiang. It is noteworthy that Shengshan shows disadvantages in terms of recreational fishery activities and experience programs, which are regarded as the strengths of Lianjiang's recreational fishery. Shengshan demonstrates strengths in accommodation and catering, which are identified as shortcomings of Lianjiang's recreational fishery. Therefore, in order to ensure the sustainable development of recreational fisheries, Shengshan Island and Lianjiang County should strive to maintain their respective strengths and improve their weaknesses. Finally, based on the analysis results and field research findings, countermeasures and suggestions for enhancing the service quality of recreational fisheries in the two regions are proposed, serving as a reference for recreational fisheries encountering similar issues.}

abstract = {With developments in cloud computing and big data, the term “cloud” has become a household name owing to its characteristics of smartness and connectedness. Cloud-based platforms are associated with people. However, multi-objective decision-making problem in cloud platforms has not been extensively studied. There is no consensus on the reasonable and effective implementation of the decision-making model to select the optimum design scheme in a cloud platform and its establishment to objectively evaluate its significance. In this study, to efficiently and accurately realize the optimal selection of design scheme, a fuzzy evaluation mechanism in handling the vagueness and uncertainty is established, with the advantage of quality function deployment and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm in decision analysis. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach in cloud platforms. To reveal the advantages of the proposed method, it was compared with other methods such as the requirement-scenario-experience evaluation framework and a rough number-based integrated method. MATLAB programming was used for this comparison and accuracy certification. The result shows that the proposed model is more efficient and dynamic and provided users with multidimensional evaluation based on open and distributed resources system.}
