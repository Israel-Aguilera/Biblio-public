abstract = {This paper aims to introduce a possible way of applying network science in Quality Function Deployment by supporting a CNC machine tool development project. Our central thesis was that by extending the QFD methodology with network assessment techniques, product developers could make more established decisions. Our work has started with an online survey, in which participants were asked to define and rank general requirements for CNC machines. Then some of the essential technical parameters were described by CNC experts. Finally, the answers' evaluation was then performed using traditional QFD methodology and the one combined with network research. We showed that the newly developed network-based QFD method offers better visualization of the matrixes. We proved by introducing new indicators such as the significance, sensitivity, and influence of the technical parameters that, also considering the correlation between the technical parameters when calculating their importance, the directions for development can be defined more precisely. Based on the results, we concluded that Network-Based - QFD could support the setting of development goals with a much more detailed analysis.}

This paper proposes an approach for manufacturing strategy development based on quality function deployment (QFD). The study starts by analyzing the process of manufacturing strategy development and the features of QFD. Thereafter, a methodology related to manufacturing strategy development based on QFD is developed, which comprises two stages and eleven steps. This approach uses QFD as a transforming device to link competitive factors with manufacturing decision categories such as structural decision categories and infrastructural categories, and uses QFD as a main tool in different stages of manufacturing strategy development process. This paper also integrates fuzzy set theory and house of quality (HOQ) in order to provide a structural tool to capture the inherent imprecision and vagueness of decision-relevant inputs and to facilitate the analysis of decision-relevant QFD information. A case is given to illustrate the utilization of the proposed approach at the end of this paper.}

abstract = {Objective
This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment.
Methodology
The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project.
Contribution
An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available.
Results
To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model.}

abstract = {With the increasing product variety, companies aim to become better than their competitors by providing a superior product developed with a customer-oriented product design approach and a quality strategy. In order to achieve this, companies should well understand customer expectations and quickly be able to convert these expectations to technical characteristics. Since the expectations consist of mostly subjective judgments, this evaluation process contains vagueness and impreciseness. A triplet represents the uncertainty in subjective judgments: the degrees of belongingness or Truthiness (T), non-belongingness or Falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I). For this reason, in this paper, a neutrosophic Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology based on neutrosophic AHP and neutrosophic DEMATEL is developed and applied to the design of a car seat. In this methodology, the weighting of customer requirements is performed by neutrosophic AHP. The relationships among the technical characteristics are determined by neutrosophic DEMATEL for the customer-oriented product design, considering both impreciseness in the data and indeterminacy of the decision-makers. In other words, the contribution of this paper is that the proposed methodology provides better integration of the voice of customers into technical characteristics through a practical fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis. Based on the results, it is revealed that seat height is the most important technical characteristic, followed by vertical travel range and horizontal travel range. Moreover, validity and verification of the proposed methodology have been tested with other methods presented in the literature. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to show the flexibility of the given decisions under different cases. Lastly, possible implications on theoretical and managerial aspects have been discussed.}

However, vagueness and impreciseness are inevitable uncertainties in those kinds of human evaluations, which are generally realized by linguistic terms. In this paper, the uncertainty in design processes is captured by a relatively new extension of ordinary fuzzy sets, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS), aiming at presenting a larger domain to experts for assigning a membership degree and a non-membership degree together with their hesitancy. We perform all the evaluation processes in the house of quality (HOQ) based on interval-valued PFS (IVPFS) and present some novel definitions for measuring and prioritizing CRs, DRs, and determining the position of the company among the competitors.

The results of the optimization model show which facilities should be open for minimization of the total cost of the network. Then, the model is extended to a multi-objective model by adding two objectives considering CO2 emissions and the quality aspects of the CLSCN.

Coupled fuzzy logic with QFD in healthcare services enables medical practitioners to understand customer requirements and include them for continuous improvement during the health service delivery.

Failure mode and effects analysis as a useful risk assessment method has become a prevalent application in product design. However, the critical data, which contain failure causality relationships (FCRs) between failure modes, importance correlations among risk factors, and customer requirements of the product component, are not considered. This study develops an integrated approach for identifying risky components considering customer requirements and FCRs. First, a quality function deployment is established to characterize the customer requirements under fuzzy assessment semantics. Second, the FCRs between and within the product components are characterized by a directed network model. In this network, the failure modes are modelled as vertices, and the causality relationships between the failure modes are modelled as directed edges. The values of the directed edges are characterized by weighted risk priority numbers, and the weight of risk factors is optimized by a nonlinear programming model. Then, the interactive relationships among failure modes between and within product components are characterized by the internal failure effect and external failure effect. Finally, a real-world case application of wheel loader is conducted to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach. The results have shown that the proposed method is more effective in identifying risk components.}

Academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chain (SSC) management has also risen considerably in recent years. This paper examines the components and elements of SSC management and how they serve as a foundation for an evaluation framework. By using quality function deployment (QFD) as a product/system planning and improvement tool, an effective SSC structure can be obtained. QFD uses a matrix called the “House of Quality” (HoQ), and constructing the HoQ is a critical step in the application of QFD as it translates customer requirements into engineering characteristics. However, participants of HoQ construction sessions tend to provide information about their individual judgments in multiple formats such as numerically or linguistically depending on their different knowledge, experience, culture and circumstance. Furthermore, they can generate incomplete preferences which are challenging to assess in a consistent way. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply an extended QFD methodology in SSC by introducing a new group decision making (GDM) approach that takes multiple preference formats and incomplete information into account and fusions different formats of expressions into one uniform group decision by means of the fuzzy set theory. To assess the validity of the proposed approach, a case study conducted at HAVI Logistics-Turkey is also presented in the paper.}

Traditionally, QFD rates the design requirements (DRs) with respect to customer needs, and aggregates the ratings to get relative importance scores of DRs. An increasing number of studies stress on the need to incorporate additional factors, such as cost and environmental impact, while calculating the relative importance of DRs. However, there is a paucity of methodologies for deriving the relative importance of DRs when several additional factors are considered. Ramanathan and Yunfeng [43] proved that the relative importance values computed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) coincide with traditional QFD calculations when only the ratings of DRs with respect to customer needs are considered, and only one additional factor, namely cost, is considered. Also, Kamvysi et al.

abstract = {The recent COVID-19 pandemic, Ukrainian-Russian conflict, China-US trade war, and current environmental concerns regarding carbon emissions have all made the semiconductor supply chain (SCSC) more vulnerable. In addition, the uncertainty of global SCSC is increasingly obscured owing to several resilience challenges within the exiting supply chain network. Thus, supply chain resilience issues are becoming popular among researchers and policymakers. Unfortunately, there is a lack of systematic research on evaluation of resilience challenges and mitigation strategies for the global SCSC. Additionally, existing models are incompetent to capture the optimistic and pessimistic views of experts during interaction assessment and mitigation strategy evaluation in an uncertain environment. Hence, this research, for the first time, develops a novel integrated Decomposed Fuzzy Set (DFS)-based Delphi, Weighted Influence Non-linear Gauge System (WINGS), and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model to identify and assess strength-interaction relationship between resilience challenges and mitigation strategies. The findings demonstrated that out of thirteen resilience challenges, seven were identified as causal group resilience challenges while the remaining six were classified as result group resilience challenges indicating that addressing the causal group resilience challenges may directly influence the mitigation of the result group resilience challenges. According to findings of DFS-WINGS analysis, the resilience challenges “Geopolitical tensions” and “Natural disasters” are the two most priority causal group resilience challenges that can significantly influence the result group system components. Furthermore, the DSF-QFD analysis confirmed that the mitigation strategies “Investing in semiconductor R&D and developing regional semiconductor manufacturing facilities” and “Diversification of key components suppliers and promoting domestic manufacturing” received the highest correlation among the mitigation strategies to address the current resilience issues faced by global SCSC. The study findings make a significant contribution to policymaking. The roles of resilience challenges and importance of mitigation strategies both can be used as benchmarks for the SCSC to make the global SCSC more resilient and sustainable.}

To measure the uncertainties and behavioral risk factors in e-commerce service design, we propose a new QFD model based on the Kano model and TOPSIS method by considering the behavior of experts with prospect theory under interval type-2 fuzzy linguistic environment. The categories of CRs are identified using the Kano model and the weights of CRs are determined dynamically according to the development stages of enterprises. The priorities of DRs are ranked using the extended TOPSIS method with prospect theory. A case study of China’s e-commerce service design is used to show the application of the proposed QFD model. The prioritizing results show the flexibility of the proposed model on determining the weights of CRs and the priorities of DRs for enterprises at different development stages.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a user requirements-oriented baby stroller design method centered on finding the best combination of functions. First, user requirements are gathered, analyzed using KJ method for hierarchical analysis and clustered according to the Kano model, and the importance of each group is determined. Then, the function of the baby stroller body is decomposed using FAST method to obtain the function structure. Finally, the function structure of the baby stroller is imported into the “requirement-function” of the quality house model to establish the correlation between user requirements and stroller functions, and a function system diagram is created. The outcome of our experimental design study shows that the proposed function-combining design method allows the designer to effectively grasp real user requirements and design a stroller using a streamlined design process, thus resulting in better designs that meet user expectations.
Relevance to industry
The proposed function-combining design method allows the designer to effectively grasp real user requirements and design a stroller using a streamlined design process.}

The present research work emphasized on identifying and optimizing various significant process parameters of high pressure die casting by using QFD-Taguchi based hybrid approach in order to yield the optimum casting density of the A380 alloy. Identification of critical process parameters, selection of appropriate orthogonal array, analysis of means and analysis of variance are employed to study the performance characteristic of the die casting process. The most critical process parameters identified and optimized by QFD-Taguchi based hybrid approach, such as the injection pressure, the molten metal temperature, the plunger velocity (first and second stage) and the die temperature were explored in the experimental work. The results show that injection pressure is the most significant factor among the selected parameters. The contribution of the injection pressure to the variation of mean casting density is around 61.483%. Confidence interval (CI) has also been estimated as 0.000718 for 95% consistency level to validate the predicted range of optimum casting density of aforesaid alloy.}

This paper presents a novel extension to the fuzzy QFD methodology using rough set theory, with the aim to facilitate decision making in the early stages of product development and lead to the establishment of a QFD-based expert system for product design. The proposed rough-fuzzy QFD system combines fuzzy arithmetic operations with the two novel concepts of rough number and rough boundary interval that are derived from rough set theory. A comparison between the proposed methodology and the traditional fuzzy QFD was performed. It has been shown that the proposed methodology not only can provide more insights into the vague voices of customers and technologists, but also can suppress the enlargement of boundary intervals after each arithmetic operation in QFD analysis. This would help in improving the discernibility of design objectives and thus facilitate the decision making in product development.}

One evacuation tool of first aid commonly used is Long Spinal Board (LSB). This tool is set up as an emergency stretcher boards made from wood or polymer with a flat surface that is used to perform the evacuation of the injured spinal cord. The basic principle of the LSB use is to immobilize the position of the spine so that the secondary injury on the spine due to swing, clash, or shocks that occurred during the evacuation process can be minimized. However, the existing LSB has several disadvantages, both in terms of user comfort, and also the effectiveness and efficiency of the evacuation process when done. A recent study found the LSB use can cause pain, discomfort, and respiratory disorders to the patients. Furthermore, the LSB can blockage the flow of oxygen in the tissue capillaries at the placement of strap. Therefore, it is important to improve the design of the LSB with the aims to achieve mobility and better equipment compatibility when used, so that the evacuation process can be done more effectively, efficiently and safely. This study identifies the design requirements of ergonomic LSB using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is an effective design method to integrate ergonomics needs and comfort into LSB design because it explicitly addresses the translation of customer requirements into engineering characteristics. Preliminary survey was conducted through direct observation of the actual use of LSB that exists today and interviews with volunteers from the Indonesian Red Cross of West Sumatera. Data gathered was translated into questionnaire and answered by 47 participants from medics, Red Cross, Ambulance Unit Medical Officer and rescue team of Padang, West Sumatera. Then it was clarified and used in the House of Quality matrix. The QFD analysis of the LSB revealed that the selection of LSB main board materials, the application of LSB strap systems, as well as the addition of LSB features were receiving the highest overall weighting, which means that improving the design of those criteria would lead to higher customer satisfaction.}

The proposed approach identifies the features that the market segments should have (“WHATs”), in order to fit with the company’s business strengths (“HOWs”). In the proposed approach, the relative importance of the “WHATs”, the “HOWs”–“WHATs” correlation scores, the resulting weights of the “HOWs”, and the impact of each potential market segment, are assessed in linguistic values. The functions of the averaged ratings and averaged weights are then defined, and fuzzy TOPSIS is used to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. The computational procedure of the proposed approach is further illustrated through a case study. Finally, this paper compares the proposed approach with another fuzzy QFD approach, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Within the context of the ongoing implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development-Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), actions toward economic, environmental, and social sustainability were aimed to be promoted. As a key stakeholder, the maritime industry's role in handling global sustainability is increasingly recognized. Social sustainability, one of the components of sustainable development, is a major concern in the maritime field for protecting the crew and providing a safe working environment. However, it is surprising to note the lack of research addressing the social sustainability of the maritime labour force in the literature. This study aims to propose a social sustainability model for the maritime labour force. The model was constructed using Card Sorting, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process (FAHP) & Quality Function Deployment (QFD) Methods. Because it discloses the expectations of the maritime labour force and the requirements that can meet these expectations, the authors have been prompted by the QFD method's frequent use in the literature and the fact that it generates the best answers to customer expectations. With the QFD method and House of Quality (HoQ) used to determine the requirements that can meet customer expectations, the requirements that can correspond to the expectations of the maritime labour force have been determined. The use of the card sorting program during the determination of the indicators has been an important point in terms of displaying a scientific approach. In addition, it is aimed to eliminate linguistic ambiguities by using the FAHP method of weighting expectations in the House of Quality method. The results revealed that work-life balance, social benefit, education and training, safety and healthy working environment at sea were the most critical expectations of seafarers, and the wage policy was less important among other expectations from the social sustainability perspective. Moreover, health and safety of people, social insurance and benefits, medical coverage and medical benefits, repatriation, understandable contract, quality and quantity of food, setting up a land-sea-land career management system, short deployment and flexible working time and, establishment of a crew welfare department were found to be the most critical requirements. The study highlights possible implications on managerial aspects and can be used as a practical guideline for decision-makers seeking to implement sustainable development in their organizations. This paper is among research studies' first to apply a hybrid approach and propose a social sustainability model for the maritime labour force. Due to the positive social and environmental effects this study will have, it will not only help seafarers, marine operators, the maritime sector, national and international economy, but also all world societies.}

In the method, the customer criteria and system criteria for KMS selection are required. These two kinds of criteria are established from the user's perspective and the designer's perspective respectively. Customers give their linguistic opinions about the importance of the customer criteria and the rating of alternatives with respect to the customer criterion. Analysts give their linguistic opinions about the relationship between the customer criteria and the system criteria, and the correlation between the system criteria. After the aggregation of linguistic opinions in intuitionistic fuzzy environment, the customers’ opinions are transformed into the rating of the weight of system criteria and rating of the alternatives concerning the system criteria by the QFD. Afterwards the alternatives are ranked according to system criteria by TOPSIS method in intuitionistic fuzzy environment and the best alternative is determined. In the end an example is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The role of the recycling supply chain in managing plastic waste problems has been emphasized by both academics and practitioners. Plastic recycling producers face various risks associated with supply chain processes that require proper management and proactive strategies to mitigate negative impacts on business performance. However, quantitative research on risk factors and corresponding proactive risk mitigation strategies in recycling supply chain has been limited. This study proposes a novel integrated approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) under the Fermatean fuzzy set framework to fill this research gap. The study identifies eleven risk factors of recycling supply chain and eight corresponding proactive risk mitigation strategies through literature review and expert validation. The SWARA technique is employed to compute the relative importance weights of risk factors, and QFD is used to analyze the relationship between risk factors and corresponding proactive risk mitigation strategies. The proposed framework is applied to a recycling plastic packaging waste manufacturer in Thailand as a case study. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can assist logistics and supply chain managers in the recycling plastic industry in making rational decisions to implement proactive risk mitigation strategies. Moreover, the framework can be applied to other waste recycling industries in a similar way.}

This new extension presenting larger domains for each parameter is employed for production design in this paper. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a structured approach for defining customer needs or requirements, which translates them into the final product in order to satisfy these needs. Spherical fuzzy QFD (SF-QFD) under impreciness and vagueness involving linguistic evaluations rather than exact numerical values is proposed in this paper. The importance ratings and global weights of customer requirements (CR) and improvement directions of design requirements (DR) are successfully represented by using spherical fuzzy sets. Judgments of multi-customers/experts are aggregated by spherical fuzzy aggregation operators. A comparative analysis using SF-TOPSIS is applied for competitive firms. A linear delta robot technology design and evaluation is performed by the proposed SF-QFD and a competitive analysis is presented.}

Given this context, this study proposes a model to support the formulation of SSDPs based on the HFLTS-QFD method, which combines Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets with the Quality Function Deployment technique. This model was applied to a European automotive company based on the judgments of an expert who evaluated six SSDPs regarding a set of buying company requirements. In this application, cost and quality were considered to be the most important requirements, whereas the programs related to the adjustment of production capacity, cost reduction, and the creation of a Kaizen system were classified as priorities for implementation. The results of the sensitivity analysis tests considering pessimistic and optimistic scenarios reinforced the robustness of the model. When compared with previous approaches, the proposed model presents several advantages, such as: it allows decision makers to use more than one linguistic term and linguistic expressions to evaluate buying company requirements and SSDPs; it considers the difficulty of implementation as a decision factor in selecting the most suitable SSDPs; and it provides an implementation ranking for the selected SSDPs based on the estimated implementation time and its potential to generate benefits for the buying company.}

Then, both qualitative and quantitative results derived from IF-Kano model are integrated into QFD with a non-linear programming model. The model aims to determine appropriate Kano categories of CRs and target values of engineering characteristics (ECs) with a view to achieving an optimal design solution under the best balance between enterprise satisfaction and customer satisfaction (CS). To solve the presented model, a multi-population adaptive genetic algorithm (MPAGA) is designed.

abstract = {Software Process Improvement (SPI) has become the key to the survival of many software development organizations. As a follow-up of a previous paper on SPI for the CMM using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a new SPI framework integrating QFD with the CMMI is developed. Similar to the earlier SPI framework for the CMM, the proposed SPI framework based on the CMMI using QFD aims to achieve three objectives: (1) to map process requirements, including business requirements, to the CMMI with the help of QFD; (2) to develop a method based on QFD for the integration and prioritization of requirements from multiple perspectives (groups); and (3) to be able to prioritize software process improvement actions based on process requirements. Process requirements from multiples groups of stakeholders (perspectives), including business goals, are integrated and prioritized. SPI actions are linked to these process requirements using QFD. Thus, the priorities of actions reflect the priorities of process requirements. By executing the actions with the highest priorities, the highest satisfaction level of process requirements can be achieved. One unique feature of the framework for the CMMI Continuous representation is that the priority values of these actions can be compared across PAs, even when the PAs attempt to reach different capability levels.}

These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision framework involving Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) to investigate the true potential of blockchain to address the CE adoption barriers. Our findings indicate that enhanced supply chain traceability management, improved collaboration and coordination in supply chain ecosystems, building higher levels of trust in supply chain ecosystems, and enhanced business models are the most significant functions of blockchain to help overcome the CE adoption barriers.}

Existing robotic vacuum cleaners can address the issues of small dust and hair accumulation; however, a comprehensive and integrated solution for sweeping, mopping, sanitizing, and general waste cleaning remains necessary. This paper employs the Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) tool and the Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving (ARIZ) algorithm to address these challenges. The research framework integrates FQFD with the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) methodology to evaluate the weights of user requirements for a robotic vacuum cleaner. Subsequently, these requirements were translated into technical specifications, thus establishing a link between user needs and technical requirements. The ARIZ algorithm is subsequently employed to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies within the FQFD model. Finally, an innovative design for a robotic vacuum cleaner was proposed by utilizing the ARIZ algorithm's problem-solving principles and qualitative and quantitative insights derived from the FQFD. The design is evaluated using the Fuzzy Order Preference Technique (FTOPSIS) method, which resembles the ideal solution. Furthermore, the operational dynamics of the critical components of the design solution that navigate obstacles are analyzed to ensure their effectiveness. The final product can effectively replace humans in complex cleaning tasks while navigating obstacles during sweeping, mopping, and sanitizing for comprehensive space cleaning. The results of this study provide valuable insights for designers to enhance user experience, improve customer emotional satisfaction, and guide future product designs in related product development initiatives.}

The application of QFD (Quality Function Deployment) can be particularly valuable to link customer expectations with the technical characteristics of the product. In the case of products, such as batteries for electric vehicles, where technology is not yet mature, and the technical requirements (e.g., autonomy) are continuously more demanding, this is particularly relevant. The QFD customer-oriented product development technique is applied to a cover of a battery pack, to improve the negotiation process with the car manufacturer, the automotive industry battery components supplier company and its suppliers, to ensure market success once the product is released. The application of the HoQ revealed that Product Design and Tolerancing are the main technical requirements with the most impact over the battery cover development, followed the Leakage ratio. This research confirms that the voice of the customer could be quite generic, and it is critical that these requirements are translated into engineering requirements, which, in turn, can be translated into items that can be measured quantitatively and actionable within the company. The application of the affinity diagram was found to be quite valuable to address the significant amount of subjective information, and it is also relevant that OEMs have a desire to standardize the electric vehicle platforms at least on fewer and general sizes, hinting the need for more collaborative team approaches.}

It is a traditional multi-attribute decision making problem, and the trade-off strategy among CRs which is interpreted as decision parameters, is crucial for resulting the overall customer satisfaction. Although the general trade-off strategies concern about the importance weights of CRs, which are specified with a variety of methods, they ignore the influence of the degree of compensation among them. In this paper, we embed the degree of compensation among CRs into QFD, which is expressed as a symmetric triangular fuzzy number, and develop a fuzzy non-linear regression model using the minimum fuzziness criterion to identify it. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the application and the performance of the modeling approach. It can be verified from the experimental results that the overall customer satisfaction as well as the prioritization of products are affected by the degree of compensation among CRs. Meanwhile, against to the products in example, the overall customer satisfaction obtained with the traditional weighted-sum method is confirmed to be underestimated.}

In the present day business, organizations have to take care of both the economic growth and environmental impact. Eco-efficiency determines the value of a product considering its environmental impact. In this research, the eco-efficiency requirements of an electronics industry are analyzed. The customer requirements (CRs) and design requirements (DRs) are identified for increasing the eco-efficiency in the industry. Seven CRs and fourteen DRs are identified for the electronics industry to improve eco-efficiency. An integrated Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is applied to prioritize the design requirements as per the customer's needs. QFD helps to incorporate the concept of the voice of customers for the design and development of products/services. The House of Quality developed translates the CRs to prioritize the DRs to improve eco-efficiency. The study encompasses the voice of customers in developing the sustainability performance of the electronics supply chain. It is found that design requirements to reduce greenhouse gases, air emissions, volatile organic compounds and carbon footprint is the most significant design parameter for eco-efficiency. The next design requirements with higher importance are Reduced use/consumption of resources, Use renewable energy like solar, State of the art innovative materials, Technologies for reducing use/consumption of energy, Green suppliers and green procurement, and Design for Environment. Focusing on these DRs aid in achieving the eco-efficiency goals of an organization. The paper contributes to the environmental sustainability aspect by identifying, prioritizing and creating a framework of requirements for eco-efficiency gains by an organization. The limitations and future scope of the study are also discussed.}

The first step was the identification of customers’ principal needs using Kano's model. Then, these needs were prioritized using AHP technique and at the end, technical commitments were ranked through QFD matrix. Ranking of the commitments reveals that the basic requirements which should be dealt with by the organization are of the most importance to the customers. The secornd requirement will be the operational and the lowest rank is devoted to the motivational requirement. In the next step, QFD shows that how customers’ need prioritize technical requirements.

Manufacturing industries strive to adopt lean concepts to maximize their resources like staff, facilities, materials, and schedules to be economically effective. However, managers face difficulty selecting the appropriate lean tools out of the many available LM tools for successful lean implementation. This study suggests an innovative approach to choose suitable lean tools to maximize these essential resources. Herein the Value Stream Mapping and plant layout are considered for waste identification. Fuzzy QFD and FMEA prioritize the crucial resources concerning the defined wastes and determine the risk associated with each failure mode's sub-element for lean application. It saves time by analyzing only the most critical resources for a successful lean implementation since its focus only on the most important resources. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study of an Ethiopian shoe manufacturing firm. With the aid of future state plant layout and value stream map, total cycle time is reduced by 56.3%, lead-time is reduced by 69.7%, materials transportation distance and transportation activities are reduced by more than 75%, and workers required are reduced from 202 to 200.}

In this research we develop a 0–1 multi-objective optimization model based on QFD methodology. Our multi-objective method is interactive and interacts with the decision makers to choose the most satisfactory efficient portfolio of supply chain resilience strategies. We apply our methodology to three large ready-made garment (RMG) companies of Bangladesh. Results show that lack of materials (high dependence on imported materials), disruptions in utility supply, increased competition (and hence competitive pressure), impact of economic recession, and reputation loss are the top most vulnerabilities of Bangladesh RMG industry. The most preferred resilience strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities are: back-up capacity, building relation with buyers and suppliers, quality control, skill and efficiency development, ICT adoption, demand forecasting, responsiveness to customers, and security system improvement. Theoretical and managerial implications of our study are included.}

In this paper, we develop a decision support system for technology adoption in transport / mobility division within the context of Industry 4.0 considering a case study in Spain. To find the adopted technology in this sector, several alternatives (options) and variables (criteria) should be assumed. We propose an integrated decision-making system including quality function deployment (QFD) and best-worst method (BWM) to find the importance weight of each criterion. After we apply the stratified Combined compromise solution (S-CoCoSo) to rate the alternatives and rank them under a multi-scenario perspective. The results will be analyzed through some sensitivity analysis actions. The novelty of our proposed decision support model contributes to the mobility sector and releases guidelines to managers and policy makers.}

In this study, we first developed a topic model named Defect Analysis Model (DAM) to discover product defects from defect-related texts, which are identified by the integrated BERT and Random Forest. Then we propose the Two-Phased Quality Function Deployment for Defect (TPQFDD) to prioritize discovered product defects. With the consideration of defect frequencies and defect costs, TPQFDD evaluates the importance of defective components, defects, and defect causes for more inspired managerial insights. We compare our approaches with baseline approaches using an online thread dataset of automobiles.

The results show that lack of awareness, lack of skilled human resource, poor logistical support and resource shortage inhibit effective delivery of m-health service.

abstract = {Lean production is one of the initiatives that major businesses all around the world have been trying to adopt in order to remain competitive in the increasingly global market. The focus of this multi-dimensional approach is on cost reduction by using tools such as Just in Time (JIT). On the other hand, many researchers have focused on the food supply chain in recent years because of the high importance of this issue in the supply chain management context. By linking Lean Attributes (LAs) and Lean Enablers (LEs), this study used Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to identify viable LEs to be practically implemented in order to increase the leanness of the food chain. Furthermore, fuzzy logic is used to deal with linguistic judgments expressing relationships and correlations required in QFD. To illustrate the practical implications of the methodology, the approach is exemplified with the help of a case study in the canning industry.}

abstract = {As a key trade facilitator, the impact of shipping on the global economy and societies cannot be underestimated. However, there are increasing trends of carbon emission caused by the shipping industry and the related cargo flow activities. As such, the adoption of green shipping practices (GSP) is increasingly popularized by shipping companies. This study aims to develop a decision-support model with systematic metrics for shipping companies to attain environmental sustainability in their operations. An integrated analytical approach which combines Analytical Network Process (ANP) with Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is proposed to serve this purpose. A case study of an international tanker shipping company is used to demonstrate the application of this approach to enhance eco-efficiency. The case results show how the ANP-QFD model can be deployed to understand customers' expectation for environmental management and develop operational measures for shipping companies to achieve environmental and market-oriented outcomes. Accordingly, this study develops the concept of Customer Cooperation Programme for Sustainability in the shipping management context. From the practical standpoint, shipping firms that emphasize sustainability as a competitive priority will benefit by communicating sustainability efforts to better serve their customers, particularly those keen on environmental preservation. The ANP-QFD approach is an integrative method helpful for shipping managers to incorporate the ‘voice’ of customers for greening into their decision-making and operations processes. The decision-support tool is useful for shipping companies to meet customer requirements for environmental performance and thus progress towards achieving more sustainable performance outcomes.}

abstract = {A wheelchair design with a nested seat back and hand-rest was proposed and ergonomically analyzed, with the objective of decreasing the likelihood of poor and awkward body postures for both the disabled user and his/her companion. The proposed design was validated by integrating a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) framework with a Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) to determine the degree of importance of the engineering characteristics. In this study, the influence of this integration on determining weights that prioritize engineering characteristics (ECs) was highlighted by taking into consideration the mutual dependence between customer needs (CNs) and ECs and the inner dependence amongst them. This study focused on utilizing FANP methodology, in which triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) were used to represent the degree of importance of CNs and ECs, since human judgments of the intensity of preference for these attributes are subjective, vague, and uncertain. Regarding the importance weights for engineering characteristics of the proposed wheelchair design, it has been found that the quality of material scores the highest weight compared to other ECs, with an overall importance weight of 0.43. This result differed from that one obtained using the QFD model without integration, in which the method of design came in first position. The integrated approach proved to be a promising tool in solving fuzzy decision-making problems in different fields and in several applications such as product development and design for ergonomics. As the FANP approach is not popular in the product development/selection field, this study will expand its employment by decision makers in facilitating the evaluation process where there are interrelated factors under an uncertain environment.}

Systems engineering has been introduced as a feasible process for handling sustainability issues in the fisheries, because it contains methods for general system design, operation, and support in a life-cycle perspective. QFD is related to systems engineering as a method for translating stakeholder needs into detailed system requirements at each life-cycle stage. Eco-QFD extends the scope of QFD, and combines QFD, Life-Cycle Cost (LCC), and Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) to evaluate environmental effects and costs in the system development process. The article assesses the usefulness of Eco-QFD in fisheries management decision-making regarding sustainability in the fishing fleet, and for shipyards in their design of fishing vessels. It is concluded that Eco-QFD may be difficult to use for fisheries management in its present form, due to the complexity of sustainability, and the time and efforts demanded to carry out the analyses. Nevertheless, the structuring of the stakeholder needs and requirements may contribute to improved understanding of the decision-situation.}

abstract = {The development of attractive and competitive products is not a question of unique features but of best quality for money. However, defining ‘quality’ from the customers’ perspective and controlling it throughout the product development process is a fuzzy and arduous task. Especially for producers of exchangeable consumer durables, which are, simultaneously, fighting cost pressure and shortening product and technology life cycles. To solve this dilemma of speed and focus, a proper methodology is needed to enhance customer orientation and systematically integrate customer requirements into the product development process. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and its derivates represent trailblazers for this kind of systematic, quality focused and customer oriented product development. Nevertheless they are largely dependent on the quality of their input. The “resolution” of requirements is crucial for the outcome. In case of single sensual perceptions as haptics or optics this challenge becomes obvious. An appropriate survey method to identify requirements regarding those sensations can be found with food science. Sensory studies for the description and discrimination of single-sense impressions are used to evaluate and improve new products, usually regarding taste and smell. The paper presents the integration of Descriptive Analysis (DA) and QFD for the case of surface haptics. Next to the fact that DA is rather new to the investigation of haptics, the integration demands a matching of steps and a combination of quantitative (DA) and qualitative (QFD) approaches. Nevertheless, this traceable and repeatable proceeding allows for an impact driven resource deployment and, for this reason, a more effective product development process, as well as a sustainable improvement in perceived product quality. A case of leather surfaces serves as an example for this matter.}

This study employs a multi-faceted approach involving the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) to prioritize customer requirements, propose technically aligned solutions, and offer innovative design options for cassava graters. A total of 10 customer requirements (CR), 21 technical solutions (TS), and 63 innovative design options (IDO) were established and prioritized, aiming for easy adoption by fabricators, engineers, manufacturers, and artisans. Implementing these insights boosts cassava grater efficiency and productivity and significantly advances knowledge.

Confronting the inherent vagueness or impreciseness in the QFD process, we embed the fuzzy set theory into QFD. A fuzzy chance-constrained modelling approach with core philosophies of fuzzy expected value model and fuzzy chance-constrained programming is used in this paper. Thus, a novel fuzzy chance-constrained programming model whose objective is to minimize the fuzzy expected cost is proposed to determine the target values of the ECs with risk control to ensure satisfying CRs. Meanwhile, when considering the importance of the ECs, we adopt a more reasonable dispose which is to aggregate the relationships between the CRs and the ECs, and the correlations among the ECs. In order to solve the presented model, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by integrating fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm. Finally, an example of a motor car design is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the devised modelling approach and algorithm.}

Supply chain collaborative design has been discussed in the literature and multiple effective methods have been proposed. Nevertheless, the systematic framework for collaboration has been scarcely addressed, and multi-objective decision-making with uncertain information and poor data is still a research difficulty. This paper proposes a novel collaborative quality design framework for large complex products supply chain by integrating the fuzzy QFD (quality function deployment) and the grey decision-making approach. The proposed method exerts QFD design deployment function to decompose design tasks to all participants in the supply chain systematically, from overall design to detailed design. The joint design team composed of supply chain participants, can effectively ensure that all design phases are aligned with the general design objective. In addition to market competitiveness and quality, multi-objective assessments are developed in the fuzzy QFD to make the design method more practical. Moreover, a weighted multi-attribute grey target decision-making method assists decision-makers to identify the optimal quality scheme with uncertain information and poor data. The proposed framework is applied to a new launch vehicle design in China to illustrate its effectiveness. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.}

Although these tools can be used separately, their integration can provide a deep analysis of the service quality, generating opportunities for its improvement. However, the effective integration of these tools requires the proper handling of their variables, which contains imprecision and uncertainties since they are based on customer’s perceptions. Fuzzy approaches are feasible alternatives to overcome these limitations and integrate these tools. Nevertheless, sophisticated fuzzy methods can deal better with these limitations. This article proposes an integrative framework involving SERVQUAL, Analytical Kano (A-Kano), and QFD using fuzzy approaches (Fuzzy Inference System and 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation). The framework comprises four main phases concerning (i) the identification of quality attributes and service processes using the A-Kano and SERVQUAL; (ii) the integration of these two quality tools using the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS); (iii) the integration between A-Kano and SERVQUAL output and QFD matrix using 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation; and (iv) the identification of improvement projects to address the opportunities identified in the previous phases. The proposed integrative framework was tested and validated in an entrepreneurial education company that provides experiential services. It contributes to providing a new method to assess the service quality perceptions, categorizing these perceptions according to their effects on customer satisfaction, prioritizing improvements, and identifying technical requirements. Mainly, this study presents a new proposal for integrating the SERVQUAL, A-Kano, and QFD using advanced fuzzy techniques, which contributes to overcoming the limitations found in the extant literature.}

This study used an innovative research approach to breastfeeding chair design from the standpoint of user requirements to improve breastfeeding willingness and user experience. We propose a user requirement assessment design approach that integrates the Kano model, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and quality function development (QFD) based on the requirements of mother and baby groups. This approach was intended to build a user experience evaluation model for mother- and baby-friendly products. Following this approach to breastfeeding chair design, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) was used to assess the chair. Compared to the original breastfeeding chairs, the designs of breastfeeding chairs that met important requirements for mothers and infants, such as safety, hygiene, and breastfeeding support, resulted in an approximately 23 % increase in user satisfaction. This effectively improved the user experience of both mothers and infants. This approach is centred on the basic requirements of mothers and babies. It evaluates the essential requirements that impact the breastfeeding experiences of mothers and babies and provides multifaceted data regarding the attributes of the different requirements of mothers and babies. This results in theoretical research references for ensuing user-driven design products that cater to the requirements of mothers and their infants and play a pivotal role in formulating design guidelines for mother- and baby-friendly products.}

An integrated fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD) framework and technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) selection algorithm is proposed. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to determine importance weights of attributes in MCDM model to avoid inconsistent results of crisp QFD analyses caused by the variability of human judgment. Fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) is used to consider both symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships between customer requirements (CRs) and engineering characteristics (ECs) for constituting internal and external correlation matrices in the house of quality (HOQ). The comprehensive weight vector of ECs is used as the weights of the selection criteria in the TOPSIS side of the integrated methodology. The proposed MCDM methodology is used for the goal of choosing the ideal gas fuel at WWTPs. Regarding to the results of application of the proposed MCDM model at a WWTP in Turkey, the most important EC regarding to the goal is hydrocarbons with the weight value of 0.32, while gas processing system with 0.21 is the second and impurities with 0.19 is the third EC. Biogas is chosen as the ideal gas fuel. In addition, natural gas is the second, liquefied natural gas is the third, compressed natural gas is the fourth and landfill gas is the fifth gas fuels in turn at the WWTP in Turkey.}

abstract = {In recent years, there is a noticeable increase in interest in supply chain smartness and sustainability since a growing number of companies are adopting smart technologies and sustainable practices in the functions of supply chain management. Therefore, scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this phenomenon can be addressed concerning companies’ maturity level of supply chain smartness and sustainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to assess the level of maturity for supply chain smartness and sustainability by weighting the functions of supply chain management. A twin-QFD technique is used to obtain a conceptual design to determine the relationship between the functions of supply chain smartness tools and sustainability indicators to assess the level of maturity, whereas the BWM is used to determine the weights of the functions of supply chain management. A case study in the automotive manufacturing industry is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings disclose the prominent smart technologies (simulation, big data analytics, cloud computing) and sustainability indicators (costs, lead time, and damage and loss) in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain practices. Findings also suggest a guideline to compare the current and targeted levels of smartness and sustainability maturity. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners and contributes to the body of knowledge by evaluating companies’ maturity of digital transformation and sustainable practices in the supply chain functions.}

abstract = {With quality function deployment (QFD) as its basis, the product design team is instrumental in promoting sustainability by incorporating relevant requirements in the early stages of the design process. The domain literature, however, contains significant gaps, especially for food products. First, the current literature fails to consider the requirements of all relevant stakeholders, which are crucial to sustainability. Second, while some offer various models of fuzzy QFD – multiple-attribute decision-making (QFD-MADM), they fail to comprehensively address the underlying interdependencies of decision parameters in the QFD. Furthermore, the majority of the works on QFD-MADM limit themselves to product planning while losing control over other subsequent phases of product development. Thus, this work attempts to advance these gaps by proposing an integrated multiphase fuzzy QFD-MADM framework that combines QFD, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and analytic network process (ANP) along with fuzzy set theory. A case study in a Philippine meat processing industry was implemented to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results of the case study show the crucial decision parameters for all phases, which would serve as inputs to design teams. Unlike previous models, the proposed framework preserves the transition of the priorities flow along with all four phases of product development. Thus, the stakeholder requirements are integrated into all product development stages, which is a strong indication that these requirements are addressed in each phase. Also, the proposed framework ensures that the uncertainty and the underlying complexities of interdependencies among decision parameters of the four phases of product design and development are addressed. The proposed framework contributes to sustainable product design literature in a manner that is comprehensive and analytical.}

As such, a constant and continuous challenge for decision makers is to decide which projects should be given priority in terms of receiving critical resources in a way that the organisation's productivity and profitability is best guaranteed. Previous literature has already developed a plenitude of project portfolio selection methodologies ranging from simple scoring to complex mathematical models. However, most of them too often fail to propose one integrated and seamless method that can simultaneously take into account three important elements: (1) prioritisation of selection criteria over each other, (2) uncertainty in decision-making, and (3) projects interdependencies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated method that can simultaneously address all these three aspects. The proposed method combines Quality Function Development (QFD), fuzzy logic, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to accounts for prioritisation, uncertainty and interdependency. We then apply this method in a numerical example from a real world case to illustrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed methodology.}

Compared to manufacturing and other disciplines where QFD is widely used, expectations of the infrastructure user as a customer are truly dynamic given the changing economic conditions, technologies, environmental regulations, etc. While such dynamic or changing customer expectations can be addressed by repeated surveys and constant communication, having indicators to predict customer response would be a valuable tool and aid the QFD decision-making process. In this study, a framework that utilizes hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed for evaluating customer expectation by using probabilities of focus areas that are of interest to the infrastructure user as hidden parameters. The focus areas are based on sustainability parameters and include economic, social, technological, maintenance efficiency, safety and environmental conditions. Probabilities that represent the probability of transition from current state (of the focus area) to next possible state were generated based on expert opinion of the authors. Using the 2005 customer survey by California Transportation, a case study is presented in order to demonstrate the application which concludes that the proposed methodology can be successfully implemented for infrastructure maintenance.}

However, the h value, which is a vital parameter in the proceeding of the FLR model, is usually set by the design team subjectively. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach using the FLR models attached with optimized h values to identify the functional relationships in QFD, where the coefficients are assumed as symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. The h values in the FLR models are determined according to the criterion of maximizing the system credibilities of the FLR models. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Results of the numerical example show that the fuzzy coefficients obtained through the FLR models with optimized h values are more effective than those obtained through the FLR models with arbitrary h values selected by the design team.}

The analysis of QFD matrices 1 and 2 identified electrical heating as the optimal method for synthesizing Na-jarosite, exhibiting removal capacities of removal capacity of 65.56 mg g−1 for As(V), 94 mg g−1 for Pb(II) and 2.45 mg g−1 for F(-). Rotating disc granulation was chosen for adsorbent formation, demonstrating environmental viability based on E Factor (0.6 kg of waste) and Eco scale (89) indicators. Further analysis of the QFD 3 matrix allowed the selection of essential equipment, including an electrical heating oven, a rotating disc granulator, and an extended tray for synthesis, granulation, and drying processes, respectively. Additionally, the QFD 4 matrix analysis identified drying the adsorbent at temperatures below 100 °C as a critical parameter for effective adsorbent formation.

It is expected to translate online opinions for designers automatically when they are launching a new product. In this research, an exploratory study is conducted, in which customer requirements in online reviews are manually translated into engineering characteristics (ECs) for Quality function deployment (QFD). From the exploratory study, a simple mapping from keywords to ECs is observed not able to be built. It is also found that it will be a time-consuming task to translate a large number of reviews. Accordingly, a probabilistic language analysis approach is proposed, which translates reviews into ECs automatically. In particular, the statistic concurrence information between keywords and nearby words is analyzed. Based on the unigram model and the bigram model, an integrated impact learning algorithm is advised to estimate the impacts of keywords and nearby words respectively. The estimated impacts are utilized to infer which ECs are implied in a given context. Using four brands of printer reviews from Amazon.com, comparative experiments are conducted. Finally, an illustrative example is shown to clarify how this approach can be applied by designers in QFD.}

First, the extant studies focused on identifying important engineering characteristics and seldom explored the subsequent prototype product selection issue. Secondly, the previous studies usually use fuzzy number algebraic operations to calculate the fuzzy sets in QFD. This approach may cause a great deviation in the result from the correct value. Thirdly, few studies have paid attention to the competitive analysis in QFD. However, it can provide product developers with a large amount of valuable information. Aimed at these three issues, this study integrates fuzzy QFD and the prototype product selection model to develop a product design and selection (PDS) approach. In fuzzy QFD, the α-cut operation is adopted to calculate the fuzzy set of each component. Competitive analysis and the correlations among engineering characteristics are also considered. In prototype product selection, engineering characteristics and the factors involved in product development are considered. A fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach is proposed to select the best prototype product. A case study is given to illustrate the research steps for the proposed PDS method. The proposed method provides product developers with more useful information and precise analysis results. Thus, the PDS method can serve as a helpful decision-aid tool in product design.}

Both methods are integrated with an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) approach to reflect the uncertainty in the QFD evaluations of decision makers.

To solve the uncertainty or imprecision in QFD, numerous researchers have attempted to apply the fuzzy set theory to QFD and have developed various fuzzy QFD approaches. Their models usually concentrate on product planning, the first phase of QFD. The subsequent phases (part deployment, process planning, and production planning) of QFD are seldom addressed. Moreover, their models often use algebraic operations of fuzzy numbers to calculate the fuzzy sets in QFD. Biased results are easily produced after several multiplicative or divisional operations. Aiming to solve these two issues, the objective of this study is to develop an extended fuzzy quality function deployment approach (E-QFD) which expands the research scope, from product planning to part deployment. In product planning, a more advanced method for collecting customer requirements is developed while the competitive analysis is also considered. In part deployment, the original part deployment table is enhanced by including the importance of part characteristics (PCs) and the bottleneck level of PCs. A modified fuzzy k-means clustering method is proposed to classify various bottleneck (or importance) groups of PCs. The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is conducted for the high bottleneck (or high importance) group of PCs through the fuzzy inference approach. Moreover, E-QFD employs a more precise method, α-cut operations, to calculate the fuzzy sets in QFD instead of algebraic operations of fuzzy numbers.

Quality function deployment (QFD) is widely used for rating ECs to satisfy consumer requirements (CRs). In existing approaches, ECs were rated by designers from CRs. With the development of the Internet, open design (OD) is exerting an increasing important effect, and consumers can freely express their requirements for the product. However, in OD environment there will be a large number of CRs expressed using the free text without the guide of purposive questions and the CRs are characterized by uncertainty and diversity of meaning, which makes it hard to rate ECs using the previous methods. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes an extended probabilistic language method based on fuzzy QFD to determine the importance weights of ECs according to the context of CRs in OD. The method focuses on considering the impact of the words in CRs to identify the relationships between CRs and ECs in OD. Meanwhile, a calculated model and a utility-based evaluation approach are suggested to rate ECs based on the fuzzy QFD. An example of the smartphone is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.}

The research gap addressed in this study is the lack of a comprehensive, data-driven optimization model for effectively mitigating sustainable supply chain management adoption challenges specific to the Bangladeshi Readymade Garments (RMG) industry. While previous studies often relied on single techniques, this research proposes a novel AHP integrated QFD-based MILP optimization model. This innovative approach empowers Bangladeshi RMG industries to make data-driven decisions for prioritizing sustainability challenges and selecting cost-effective mitigation strategies to promote the integration of sustainability initiatives within the sector. The study identifies and prioritizes 25 sustainable supply chain management adoption challenges and proposes 16 mitigation strategies. The model emphasizes the critical interplay between sustainability performance and implementation costs, achieving a sustainability performance score of 0.4511 while effectively implementing 12 out of 16 strategies within the expected budget. The optimal solution incorporates green strategies, technology integration, and aspects of Industry 5.0, demonstrating a holistic approach to sustainable supply chain management. The findings are crucial for Bangladeshi RMG industries aiming for global market competitiveness and contribute significantly to the academic field by introducing a robust, data-driven decisions for sustainable supply chain optimization. The implications extend beyond the RMG sector, offering a replicable model for other industries and regions facing similar sustainability challenges.}

Moreover, with the introduction of micro-computers, large databases for maintaining such autonomous vehicles can be handled easily. This paper presents a collective study of Kano model analysis and quality function deployment (QFD) in a detailed manner. Different attributes were provided to the potential customers regarding an autonomous electric car in a survey form. The consumers were asked to express their feelings regarding the product if a particular feature is provided and not provided in the product for conducting Kano analysis. Furthermore, QFD was implemented to determine the priority for making improvements in the product profile design. The attributes were mapped to technical metrics/parameters and ranked based on the target customers’ priorities. The output is displayed in a typical house of quality which also consisted of a benchmarking on market competitors. Overall, the paper provides a scientific and engineered framework regarding the attributes which may help the manufacturing organizations re-evaluate their services and come up with efficient and new technological features in the automobile domain.}

The results demonstrate that understanding the customer expectations with customer relation management is the most important innovation strategy for the green supply chain management in energy industry with the consecutive stages of QFD whereas benchmarking the competitive market environment has relatively the last seat in the ranking. Hence, it is recommended that energy companies should have an effective customer relationship management. In this context, these companies should make a detailed analysis to learn what their customers directly expect from them. With the help of this issue, these companies should generate their product and services based on these expectations. Additionally, it is also stated that new service and product development is also essential for energy companies to improve their innovativeness. For this purpose, a research and development department should be created, and the qualified people should be employed. Additionally, different opinions should be collected from various parties, such as customers, employees, and suppliers.

Studies have shown, however, that this design poses problems with usability (difficulty in extruding toothpaste) and sustainability (difficulty in disposing or recycling of materials). While efforts have been made to alleviate these concerns, new designs fail to adequately address both problems jointly. For this reason, this paper aims to introduce a new design incorporating these two aspects for the benefit of its users and the environment. The Green Quality Deployment (GQFD) II methodology was therefore applied in this study as it employs a quantitative approach to developing products by addressing customer needs while also considering sustainability. It was then determined that a rigid, twistable tube made of polylactic acid (PLA) yielded the best mix of usability and sustainability considerations and was chosen among the other alternatives. This was supported by user feedback given that 6 of the 7 customer requirements showed an enhanced performance compared to the laminated tube, using the Welch's t-test having a p-value of less than 0.05. On average an improvement of 1.16 points (out of a scale of 5) was achieved. This suggests that the integration of both usability and sustainability in product design is possible without compromising on one aspect for the other and that sustainable products need not sacrifice functionality. Thus, it serves as a stepping stone towards achieving sustainable production and consumption by providing functional eco-friendly alternatives.}

The aim of this study is to provide managers with a more decisive and sustainable framework to fulfill customer satisfaction by determining the most essential customer needs and gain a competitive advantage by applying a benchmarking process for the whole retailing activities. To essentially support managers in determining and implementing required store attributes, this study develops a sustainable linear programming (LP) based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology under IVIF-environment. The proposed method determines more accurate customer expectations (CEs) and related service requirements (SRs). Accordingly, while “Clothing Quality”, Price Policy”, and “Staff Behavior” are determined as the most important CEs, “Design of Customer Persona”, “Production Cost”, and “Marketing Applications” are obtained as the most affecting SRs. Since no specific study in the literature addresses uncertainty in CEs and SRs in the apparel retailing industry, we developed an LP-based QFD under the IVIF-environment framework, which reflects the ambiguity and vagueness of the evaluations better. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by proposing a sustainable framework for managers to make decisions that are more effective and take sustainable actions. The companies who want to get the advantage in the apparel retailing industry should follow the methodology provided within this study by adding their business specific dimensions. Lastly, to represent the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach sensitivity and comparison analysis are conducted. The results of comparison show that the LP based QFD method is as consistent as other method but more effective in terms of handling ambiguity and fuzziness of expert evaluations, comprehensively.}

This work developed and applied a quality function deployment method based on the spherical fuzzy bipartite graph (SFBG-QFD) to comprehensively consider the dependency relationship between PRs and DRs during AP design. Specifically, a spherical fuzzy bipartite graph is constructed in the PR-DR relationship matrix. The projection algorithm generates the one-mode spherical fuzzy graphs of PRs and DRs, reflecting the internal relationship of PR-PR and DR-DR pairs. Subsequently, the interaction influence of PRs and DRs is defined as an additional criterion for the QFD method. Through the SFBG-QFD method, designers can better consider the uncertainty of interaction between different types of requirements and make more reliable decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the AP design for pneumoconiosis patients, and the stability and potential of the proposed method are emphasized through comparative studies.}

The accurate and heuristic root cause analysis for QAs is an important and challenging task in exploring this mechanism due to the fuzzy and vague nature of the collected big quality data. Thus, in this study, a heuristic root cause identification solution based on the fuzzy weighted association rule mining (FWARM) for QAs is proposed. First, the formation mechanism of QAs and big quality accident data is expounded, and a big data driven root cause analysis framework of QAs is presented with the aid of reverse cascading decomposition in Quality Function Deployment (QFD). Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is adopted to eliminate redundancy and reduce data dimension of original process feature parameters from raw data in low-dimensional space so that the key variables as the potential root cause candidates can be extracted. Third, considering the fuzzy mechanism and vague nature of big data, a heuristic root cause identification approach based on FWARM is established, and the weight of nodes on the accident-relevance tree is computed by fuzzy weight coefficient. Finally, the proposed approach is verified with a case study of a quality accident analysis of a washing machine.

It is important that SMEs are able to prioritize business quality by identifying business requirements based on customer requirements. This strategy is able to help SMEs generate innovation in the form of improved business quality activities to meet customer requirements. This approach uses the “quality function deployment (QFD)” method to identify the priority business requirements and improvement actions to generate business quality. As a result, we managed to identify five priority variable business requirements (BReqs) based on seven variable customer requirements (CReqs) with the lowest satisfaction score. We proposed some improvement actions in perspective quality based on five priority business requirements. Moreover, the final quality matrix of business quality improvement priority generally makes it easier for users to read and find out which variables need to be improved. This research also presents a solution so that users can perform business actions effectively and efficiently in allocating their resources.}

As an effective method of multi-objective decision-making, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method can describe, evaluate, and rank the evaluation objects according to different criteria. Therefore, this paper proposes a new integrated MCDM method for improving QFD, which integrates the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA). Firstly, the HFLTS is used to deal with the ambiguity in the evaluation process. Secondly, with regard to the interaction relationships among QCs, fuzzy DEMATEL technology is employed to capture their influence weights. Furthermore, an extended MULTIMOORA method is developed, which combines the entropy weight method to obtain the objective weights of customer requirements (CRs), and introduces the influence weights to prioritize QCs. Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method are verified by an example regarding the product design of CNC machine tool.}

Product-service system (PSS) is a highly integrated production system of products and services which can afford full life cycle product and service solutions. This paper introduces a nursing bed PSS, which is able to provide sustainable functional solutions for product design guided by customer requirements. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a common method for requirement-driven solution design, which can transform requirement attributes (RAs) into engineering characteristics (ECs). Nevertheless, general QFD requirement acquisition exists limitations, such as the subjectivity and incomprehensiveness of expert evaluations. Besides, the psychological preference of decision makers to deal with risk is ignored. In this study, we propose a scenario-driven dual-layer requirement network and a modified QFD model to mine latent RAs and prioritize the ECs by maximizing customer satisfaction using Nash Bargaining. The major contributions are listed as follows. First, nursing scenarios drive the acquisition of multiple stakeholders. Second, link prediction program is employed to map and mine latent RAs. Third, TODIM is applied in order to consider the psychological references of decision makers. Fourth, a Nash bargaining non-linear programming model is constructed for optimal compensation of ECs to maximize customer satisfaction under cost constraint. Finally, functional solutions of nursing bed are designed through the proposed QFD model, which are demonstrated to be effective and superior. The results indicate that the new proposed scenario-driven dual-layer network QFD model can capture latent RAs from nursing scenarios, take experts psychological preferences into consideration, provide a more precise ranking of ECs for the development of nursing bed functional solutions.}

In response to the rise of intelligent products and the increasing prevalence of urban "empty nesters," we have developed a product specifically tailored for elderly diabetic patients. This product fulfils functional requirements and addresses stylistic preferences, contributing to the age-friendly evolution of home intelligent medical devices, particularly in intelligent blood glucose monitoring.
Methods
Our approach commenced with a comprehensive user experience analysis to ascertain the needs of elderly users regarding home blood glucose meters. This involved constructing a hierarchy of user demands, followed by analysing and prioritising these needs. Utilizing Quality Function Deployment (QFD), we aligned user requirements with design specifications, identifying specific product functionalities and service design elements. Further, we employed Kansei Engineering (KE) to select sample designs that resonate with the concept of sensual imagery, leading to the derivation of specific modelling intentions. Combining these design elements, we proposed product design strategies and conducted practical case studies. The effectiveness of these designs was then assessed through fuzzy evaluation methods, allowing for user feedback.
Results
Employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process for goal analysis, along with Quality Function Deployment theory and Kansei Engineering, we developed a home intelligent blood glucose meter catered to the elderly. This device not only meets its users' physiological and psychological needs but also provides an operationally convenient, health-conscious, and aesthetically pleasing experience.
Conclusions
This methodology enhances the age-appropriate design of home-based smart glucose monitors for the elderly, offering innovative insights and optimization strategies for designing elderly-centric smart medical products.}
