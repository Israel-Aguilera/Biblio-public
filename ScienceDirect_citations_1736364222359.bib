abstract = {In recent years, the number of direct flights between Taiwan and mainland China has grown rapidly, as charter flights have been turned into regular flights. This important issue has prompted airport ground handling service (AGHS) companies in Taiwan to enhance convenient services for passengers and to invest in airport logistics center expansion plans (ALCEP) to broaden the AGHS market. Due to their budgetary restrictions, AGHS companies need to outsource many of their services to contractors to implement these plans. This study proposes an ALCEP solution procedure to guide AGHS companies in adjusting their priority goals and selecting the best contractor according to their needs. This proposed procedure successfully solves the ALCEP problem and facilitates the assignment of contractors by considering both qualitative and quantitative methods.}

abstract = {To manage the design matrix is an apparently easy thing to do. Discovering incongruences and converging at least towards a decoupled structure could suggest to designers that they have reached a sufficiently good starting point for the product under development. This is not sufficient. To be able to evaluate the information content of that solution is on the contrary an almost difficult activity because many relations between Functional Requirements and Design Parameters may not be completely defined deterministically. Eliminating bias and reducing variance remain the objective to be pursued. The paper discusses a procedure based on the Taguchi method to orient designers when verifying the influence that each design parameter has on the functional requirements. After the association of an Objective Function with one functional requirement or with a macro-functional requirement, the relation between the Objective Function and a set of design parameters can be identified from the Design Matrix. This can allow the designer to discern the best range of each parameter, analysing the Mean Value of the Objective Function and Signal to Noise Ratio. In the case of a conjoint influence of many design parameters on the functional requirement, it is important to verify the mutual interaction among the design parameters and evaluate the kind and level of interaction.}

Light-saturated net photosynthesis rates during emersion were found to be in the same magnitude as values reported in the literature for both species under submersed conditions at various locations. Net photosynthesis of exposed shoots of Z. noltii showed a very low light-compensation point, a high light-saturation value, and a light-saturated assimilation rate nearly twice as high as for co-occuring Z. marina plants. Artificial drying of the leaves of Z. marina in the air stream of the gas exchange cuvette led to a continuous reduction in the light-saturated net photosynthesis rate that was partly reversible after re-wetting of the leaves. More research is needed to qualify whether intensive photosynthetic activity is a common phenomenon in emersed intertidal seagrass populations and how significant this process is for the carbon balance of these plants.}

In order to meet these requirements, many enterprises face a critical need for advanced system engineering for Engineering. The changeover from the Traditional method of manufacturing to Concurrent method of manufacturing is one of the solutions. The front fork of the leading two wheeler was chosen for implementing the Redesign in Concurrent Engineering (CE). The main objective is to reduce the Manufacturing lead time and the cost of the product. The Co-ordinates of the already existing Front fork of a leading 2 wheeler was done using Co-ordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) and the model of the fork was obtained in CATIA, which is a Reverse Engineering concept. The model of the fork was stored in a database, such that it can be retrieved anytime in future. Slight variations in the design in future can also accommodated. Parts with similar design attributes can be grouped such that the Group Technology is achieved. The machining simulation was done using CATIA. The machining simulation can also be used to group the components having similar manufacturing attributes by storing the machining codes generated, in the database. The buckling analysis of the component was done using ANSYS for compressed loading condition. As the number of iterations in the Redesign-Concurrent method increased, both time and the cost reduced drastically.}

However, DfX methodologies are undergoing the lack of real integration with 3D CAD systems. Their principles are currently applied downstream of the 3D modelling by following the well-known rules available from the literature and engineers’ know-how (tacit internal knowledge). This paper provides a method to formalize complex DfX engineering knowledge into explicit knowledge that can be reused for Advanced Engineering Informatics to aid designers and engineers in developing mechanical products. This research work wants to define a general method (ontology) able to couple DfX design guidelines (engineering knowledge) with geometrical product features of a product 3D model (engineering parametric data). A common layer for all DfX methods (horizontal) and dedicated layers for each DfX method (vertical) allow creating the suitable ontology for the systematic collection of the DfX rules considering each target. Moreover, the proposed framework is the first step for developing (future work) a software tool to assist engineers and designers during product development (3D CAD modelling). A design for assembly (DfA) case study shows how to collect assembly rules in the given framework. It demonstrates the applicability of the CAD-integrated DfX system in the mechanical design of a jig-crane. Several benefits are recognized: (i) systematic collection of DfA rules for informatics development, (ii) identification of assembly issues in the product development process, and (iii) reduction of effort and time during the design review.}

Product platform architectures support planning for addressing diverse markets and fulfilling future market desires. Applying standardization or modularization on product platform components leverages current product design effort across future products. This work introduces a method—SMDP (standardization and modularization driven by process effort)—for focusing engineering effort when applying standardization or modularization on product platform components. SMDP calculates the total design effort from current to future generations of the platform following standardization or modularization of components. By comparing the total design cost of different simulations, we can direct the design team to standardization or modularization opportunities. The contribution of this work is in using an estimation of design effort as the basis for decision in contrast to commonly used static measures of components' interactions. Such a computational approach allows conducting sensitivity studies that address the subjective nature of various estimations needed for exercising SMDP. SMDP is illustrated in a product platform design of an external-drum plate-setter for the digital prepress printing market.}

This NP-hard problem is an important issue involving several contradictory objectives which have to be tackled by software companies when developing new releases of software packages. Software projects have to stick to a budget, but they also have to satisfy the highest number of customer requirements. Furthermore, when managing real instances of the problem, the requirements tackled suffer interactions and other restrictions which make the problem even harder. In this paper, a novel multi-objective teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm has been successfully applied to several instances of the problem. For doing this, the software requirements selection problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives: the total software development cost and the overall customer׳s satisfaction. In addition, three interaction constraints have been also managed. In this context, the original TLBO algorithm has been adapted to solve real instances of the problem generated from data provided by experts. Numerical experiments with case studies on software requirements selection have been carried out in order to prove the effectiveness of the multiobjective proposal. In fact, the obtained results show that the developed algorithm performs better than other relevant algorithms previously published in the literature.}

However, in order for the embedded system to be adaptable its architecture, the first step in the development, should itself be adaptable. It will be helpful if the generation of this architecture could be automated. In this paper, we describe a tool called the Software Architecture Adaptability Assistant (SA3) that helps generate adaptable architectures. SA3 uses the properties of the NFR Framework, in particular its knowledge base properties, to create a catalog of various constituents of architecture such as components and connections, and then searches the catalog to find adaptable constituents for the architecture. In this paper, we describe the theory behind SA3 and then describe the tool itself. We then demonstrate the architecture generation capability of the tool for embedded systems. We also discuss why these architectures are adaptable as well as point out directions for further improvement.}

Four sustainable mobility sharing systems are proposed. They are electric vehicle (EV) sharing, autonomous EV sharing, e-bike sharing, and e-scooter sharing systems. A multi-level practical framework, including four clusters and 20 criteria offers a primer on how city authorities should evaluate mobility sharing systems in real-life settings. Also, this research introduces an advanced decision-making model to prioritize sustainable mobility sharing systems. The model integrates the DIBR (Defining Interrelationships Between Ranked criteria) method and the EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) method in a fuzzy-rough environment. A case study of Belgrade, Serbia, is provided to offer decision-making guidelines in a real-world context. The practical findings show that “e-bike sharing” is an advantageous alternative in the context of Belgrade. The integrated fuzzy DIBR and fuzzy-rough EDAS model could serve as a powerful tool for rational and objective solving not only the newly addressed problem but also other emerging decision-making problems related to sustainable cities.}

A better understanding of what affects cocoa quality will allow researchers and managers to improve their product, benefiting producers and consumers. The present analysis was based on known desired characteristics of the cocoa bean. Total fat, total acidity, total phenols, phenolic acids, organic acids, heavy metals, amino acids, caffeine, theobromine, pH, sugars and macro and micronutrients were the main variables included in the CQI for the Forastero cocoa beans. The analysis was run on beans from two separate sites in Bahia, an Oxisol and an Alfisol. CQI values from the two sites did not differ statistically, but the adopted qualitative classification identified that the Alfisol had a ‘good’ CQI (0.703) while the Oxisol was classified as ‘regular’ one (CQI = 0.652). The difference was due to the better edaphic characteristics of the Alfisol. Results suggested that improving the cocoa bean in Bahia will require that total fat, phenolic compounds and glucose be increases and that total phenols, heavy metals, organic acids and caffeine be decreased. The proposed CQI method can be adapted to other agricultural products.}

Although there are several studies dealing with these aspects separately, to the best knowledge of the authors, this study is the first candidate attempting to solve this type of problem with an integrated approach including Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. This study mainly operates in two stages. In the first stage, the relative weights of each criterion for each type of item are determined via F-AHP technique. In the second stage, these outputs are used as inputs in the MILP model to determine the suppliers and the quantities to be provided. In order to validate the model, an application is performed in a gear motor company and numerical results of the problem are revealed to select the best suppliers among 6 alternatives, for the procurement of 5 items regarding 4 criteria, namely, price, quality, delivery time performance, and after sales performance, in case of quantity discounts.}

All 25 participants were non-Hispanic white and the median age was 33 years (range: 19–57). All had ever injected extended-release oxymorphone (Opana® ER) and most (n=20) described preparing Opana® ER for multiple injections per injection episode (MIPIE). MIPIE comprised 2–4 injections during an injection episode resulting from needing >1mL water to prepare Opana® ER solution using 1mL syringes and the frequent use of “rinse shots.” MIPIE occurred up to 10 times/day (totaling 35 injections/day), often in the context of sharing drug and injection equipment.
Conclusions
We describe a high-risk injection practice that may have contributed to the rapid spread of HIV in this community. Efforts to prevent bloodborne infections among people who inject POA need to assess for MIPIE so that provision of sterile injection equipment and safer injection education addresses the MIPIE risk environment.}

However, the descriptions of linguistic terms in the form of traditional fuzzy sets are not perfectly supported in the sustainable supplier selection process. Luckily, the intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets can effectively deal with this uncertain and incomplete data information when selecting evaluation criteria and facing with the ambiguity of human thinking, whereas providing us with a helpful tool to resolve fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems in a more flexible way. Moreover, the cumulative prospect theory can be introduced to well depict decision-makers’ risk preferences and psychological behaviors. Therefore, this study develops a novel fuzzy MCDM approach based on the combination of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, interval-valued fuzzy sets and cumulative prospect theory for selecting the most sustainable supplier. A case study from the sustainable recycling supplier selection of e-bike sharing is studied to illustrate applicability of the proposed method. By comparing with other methods, the rationality and feasibility of the proposed method are verified. This can provide an insightful implication for decision-makers with different risk preferences to select the most sustainable supplier under uncertain environment.}

This study presents a robust design approach incorporating the Kano model to obtain the optimal combination of design form elements. This can effectively enhance customer satisfaction and aesthetic product qualities with multiple-criteria characteristics. The Kano model is used to better understand the relationship between performance criteria and customer satisfaction, and to resolve trade-off dilemma in multiple-criteria optimization by identifying the key criteria in customer satisfaction. The robust design approach combines grey relational analysis with the Taguchi method to optimize subjective quality with multiple-criteria characteristics. This simultaneously yields the optimal aesthetic performance and reduces the variations in customer evaluations. Based on Kano model analysis, a weight adjustment process determines the weight of each product criterion for achieving the desired customer satisfaction performance. This process guides the prioritizing of multiple criteria, leading to higher customer satisfaction. A mobile phone design experiment was conducted to verify the benefits of using the proposed integrative approach. Results show that the generated optimal mobile phone design can effectively enhance overall aesthetic performance and customer satisfaction. Although mobile phone designs are the examples of this study, the proposed method may be further used as a universal robust design approach for enhancing customer satisfaction and product quality with multiple-criteria characteristics.}

Also of significance is how well the programme and its projects are aligned to the company's strategy. Frequently practitioners will select projects on their individual merits, rather than with proper reference to their contribution to business strategy. In this manner, it is therefore possible to build portfolios of projects that are at best suboptimal and at worst counter to the company's overall strategic direction. The construction of project portfolios is thus a critical step in effective programme management and this would suggest that organizations would benefit from a framework to assist them with the selection of projects and portfolios that are aligned with the company's overall strategy. While tools such as Critical to Quality Flow-down are available to translate the voice of the customer to metrics and goals, practitioners do not have a structured approach to construct and assess portfolios. In this paper we present a framework to assist programme managers to develop portfolios of improvement projects targeted to fulfil their company's strategic needs and also align with the organisation's objectives and measures. Consideration is given to quantitative and qualitative aspects of strategy and how these may best be related to provide a set of orthogonal and common metrics.}

Decision makers (DMs) or SoS experts must select the optimal equipment portfolios for engineering and manufacturing under many constraints. Aiming to solve this problem, a hybrid method integrated network DEA and grey target model is introduced. Firstly, modelling the ESoS. By the network DEA approach, each ESoS is described as a three-stage network decision unit with inputs and outputs. Then calculate the input–output efficiency of equipment portfolios from the perspective of benefit and we consider two situations about development cost. Finally, with three stages efficiency as objectives, the grey target technique is applied to rank the portfolios. Moreover, the case study verifies the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed methodology via selection decision results obtained with development cost is sufficient or limited. DMs can use the suggested methodology to help them make decisions on the difficulty of selecting equipment portfolios. The network DEA approach makes the first attempt in the literature at ESoS input–output efficiency evaluation; based on this, the performance and cost of single equipment and the ESoS effect are all taken into account in the selection process.}

Even though MC strategy was described decades ago, its implementation within industry is hindered by the partial understanding of its underlying philosophy and operational drivers. A central question to be dealt with for a successful MC implementation is how to balance between products and services variety and their induced complexity. Modularity is one of the commonly used means for dealing with such as question. While this concept has been widely discussed in product design and operations management literature at large, its applicability to service or product-service systems is only poorly addressed. This paper addresses the question of how to deal with the service modularity and how this can be exploited jointly with product modularity to modularize an offering, in a way to increase offering variety and improve internal company performance.}

We noticed a critical research gap when we performed an extensive literature review. Although there are many studies available that assess the readiness of companies for I4, only a few deal with decision-making in terms of sustainable development, and none have applied that to the automotive industry. Practitioners can apply the proposed model to determine the strategy based on technological developments in I4. The current paper proposes an extended version of the combined compromise solution approach with the help of the picture fuzzy sets. According to the paper's results, by using the proposed model, developing a new business model based on technological improvements is the best strategy for the digital transformation of the automotive industry. Also, the lack of research and development implementations on I4 implementation is the most influential factor. Hence, practitioners in the automotive industry know the significance of research and development in reaching successful results for digital transformation. The acquired outcomes of the paper show that developing technology-based new business models is the best strategy for the automotive manufacturing industry concerning digital transformation instead of accommodating traditional business models and high technology utilization.}

This paper incorporates domestic trade and transport margins into the GTAP-E model, which has previously been used to analyze climate change policies. Models that do not explicitly incorporate domestic margins over-estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions from a given carbon tax or under-estimate the level of a carbon tax needed to achieve a specific abatement target when domestic margins are fixed or when the carbon tax is treated as a consumption tax with variable domestic margins. However, this result can be reversed when the carbon tax is treated as an output tax with variable domestic margins.}

However, these new production technologies are not only considered for lightweight components but also for the manufacturing of molds, tools and jigs. In this context the additive manufacturing of heated compression molds for the production of thermoset composites by using a Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or also called Laser Beam Melting (LBM) process is particularly promising. In comparison to conventional machining the additive tool manufacturing obtains shortened time for development, simplified of the production due to less process steps, reduced production lead time and a general cost reduction. By the way, less energy consumption and improved material usage for the manufacturing of composite molds are further benefits, which cause an additional increase of the cost efficiency and economical sustainability. Moreover, an optimization of the fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) part quality, an improvement of the reproducibility of manufacturing processes and a higher freedom of the part design can be realized due to a higher complexity of the mold geometry, an increased functional integration, new design approaches of heating channel systems and an improved temperature distribution of the additive manufactured compression molds. Consequently, these new composite tool manufacturing opportunities promise enormous potentials, but also several challenges for the future production of aircraft components. This paper deals with a first feasibility analysis of the Additive Layer Manufacturing of heated composite molds, jigs and tools for aerospace industries. Furthermore, the additive manufacturing of a heated research mold for a Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) aircraft component and first investigation findings of the influences on the manufacturing process parameters by using this research mold are further key aspects of the present work.}

In the IIDSE, the importance degrees of the DVs and PVs are analysed based on their differences. Then, according to the importance classifications, values, characteristics, and numbers of DVs and PVs, a multi-information fusion (MIF)-based ideal solution definition strategy, which covers quantitative criteria with i) benefit characteristics, ii) cost characteristics, and iii) qualitative criteria, is proposed. A rough multi-criteria decision-making (R-MCDM) model is used to evaluate an alternative by computing its deviation from the defined ideal solution. The effectiveness of the IIDSE was validated via empirical comparisons. Experiment I showed that the MIF-based strategy is compatible with different R-MCDM models for selecting the preferred and best performing solution. In experiment II, among the R-MCDM models, R-COPRAS plus the MIF-based strategy is the best combination for constructing the IIDSE. Experiments III and IV demonstrated that the IIDSE can obtain more reasonable solutions compared with classical evaluators, especially in the case where conflictions between the objective DVs and subjective PVs exist.}

However, limited by various factors, the NSR has not witnessed sustained commercial operation, that is, no shipping companies have started regular services there. By reviewing existing literature, we classify 10 factors that have influenced NSR development into four categories: natural conditions, commercial costs, service support, and political considerations. We evaluate the interdependent relationships among these factors through a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL), an effective approach in identifying the cause–effect chain in an uncertain and complex decision-making environment. The most critical elements restricting Arctic NSR development include extreme climate, political considerations, and sea ice condition based on expert inputs. This study discusses relations among these factors as well as their policy implications, which could contribute to the decision making of shipping companies and policy focus of the government.}

This input is invaluable in defining and understanding the technical/functional needs that the product must fulfill.

Along with the functional needs, these play an important role in the ultimate success of a product. This is particularly true in the case of assistive products where functionality is critical but the treatment of non-functional needs can play a large role in a device's acceptability, the stigma associated with it and reducing rates of abandonment. This paper will review the product development challenges faced by producers of assistive technology products. It will then describe results from two early studies which may provide new approaches to meeting these challenges. The first is an investigation of the accuracy of user input when it is provided based on different representations of a design (such as sketches, renderings or models) that are commonly available at various stages of the design process. A better understanding of this input will allow designers to focus more on the components of it that are more likely to accurately represent users’ opinion of a finished product. The second is an investigation into the use of augmented reality to facilitate usability testing of design concepts.}

abstract = {This paper uses System Dynamics modeling and process simulation to explore coordination in two logistic processes (procurement and production) of the supply chain of an ethanol plant. In that sense, three production scenarios are evaluated to identify: a) stock movement according to current inventory policies, and b) the critical variables affecting the coordination for these two processes. Since the main goal in the company is to meet customer demand, this research incorporates sales forecasting, and four performance indicators to evaluate the state of the processes: 1) average percentage of demand satisfaction, 2) maximum amount of ethanol in excess, 3) available ethanol at the end of the year, and 4) inventory costs. To model the case study, the change in production yield and specific constraints for the chain are considered. The simulation results show that System Dynamics modeling can be used to observe the effects of policies on inventory, and meeting the demand in a real system. It also can define the coordination for a supply chain and give information to improve it. The developed model uses STELLA® software to simulate the logistic processes and execute the evaluation employing the performance indicators.
Resumen
Haciendo uso del modelado en Dinámica de Sistemas y simulación, se explora la coordinación de dos procesos logísticos (aprovisionamiento y producción) de la cadena de suministro de una alcoholera. En este sentido, la evaluación de tres escenarios de producción permite identificar: a) el movimiento del inventario de acuerdo a las políticas actuales de inventario, y b) las variables críticas que afectan la coordinación de estos dos procesos. Dado que el objetivo principal de la empresa es satisfacer la demanda del cliente, se incorpora un pronóstico de ventas, y cuatro indicadores de desempeño para evaluar el estado de los procesos: 1) el porcentaje promedio de la satisfacción de la demanda, 2) la cantidad máxima de etanol en exceso, 3) el etanol a disponer al finalizar el año, y 4) los costos de inventario. Para modelar el caso de estudio, se considera el cambio en el rendimiento de producción y las restricciones particulares de la cadena. Los resultados de la simulación muestran que la Dinámica de Sistemas puede utilizarse para observar los efectos de las políticas sobre el inventario, y la satisfacción de la demanda en un sistema real, igualmente, permite definir la coordinación para una cadena de suministro y proporcionar información para mejorarla. El modelo creado utiliza el software STELLA® para simular los procesos logísticos y para realizar la evaluación utilizando los indicadores de desempeño.}

The paper is based on the assumption that the need for technology transfer originates from a markets failure, i.e. a significant imbalance between supply and demand for innovation. A smooth technology transfer is likely to correct this market imbalance, while difficulties in achieving technology transfer generates lack of competitiveness, inability to generate added value, especially in the economic sector and the impossibility to achieve the innovative potential, both within SMEs (main sources of innovation in a functional market economy) and institutions which operate in research-development-innovation field.}

Unfortunately, sourcing digital services from external providers has brought with it stringent quality of service (QoS) demand from the library service users. Currently, there is no way for ensuring QoS between the digital service providers and the library management. In this paper, we propose service level agreements (SLAs) to capture the QoS requirements of the digital service users and the commitments, as well as adherence of the digital service providers.}

It is a major activity that can assist manufacturers to identify optimal conceptual design before prototyping can commence. This article presents the identification of optimal conceptual design by hybridizing two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) models which are; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy Grey Relational Analysis (F-GRA). The selection of F-AHP and F-GRA is based on the ability of the F-AHP to determine weights of design features and sub-features without prejudice and the ability of the F-GRA to create comparability elements for the design concepts considering their distances from an ideal design. An extensive analysis on the formulation of mathematical model for the two MCDM models is presented which is followed by the application of the hybridized model to the appraisal of conceptual designs of pipe bending machine. The hybridized model provided satisfactory results by its ability to identify one of the designs as an optimal design considering the values obtained from the fuzzified grey relational grades. The performance of the model was validated by a sensitivity analysis using two defuzzification methods and various values of the distinguishing or resolving coefficient. The variation of the resolving coefficient shows that the application of the hybridized model to design concept selection is viable in terms of stability and uniformity over a wide range of resolving coefficient.}

Moreover, due to the rising competition in the HDS sector, service providers need to put more concentration on the continual improvement and differentiation of service to maintain the competitive advantage. After experiencing the current services, customers are always expecting the new ones. Thus, the idea of new service design never ends. Designers always have to insight into the real feelings of customers so that they could design the new service, which is able to meet customers' expectation. Kansei engineering is a means to transform real voices of customers into the product and service design. This method is able to quantify the relationship between feelings represented by simple words and design elements. In this study, the Partial Least Square (PLS) is used to analyze the relationships between the real feelings of customers and characteristics of HDS. Finally, this study combines those characteristics, which are strongly related to important feelings, to obtain the original idea of new design of HDS.
Relevance to industry
As stated in this abstract, our study offers an exemplification on applying Kansei engineering to design service in service industries. Specifically, along with the application of Kansei engineering, the research findings offer a technique for service design of service industries.}

However, EBM requires the realization of co-benefits of biodiversity and human wellbeing improvement. Furthermore, overall and internal knowledge of the ecoregion of interest is essential. With this knowledge, EBM can be integrated better into the spatial planning process. The present study proposes a dual service strategy for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA): the ecosystem-based adaptation for human index (EbA-HI) and the ecosystem-based adaptation for biodiversity index (EbA-BI), which are examined at finer spatial scales. The Qilian Mountain protected area was used as an example to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the two indices. Panel quantile regression was used to identify factors influencing the spatial distribution variations. Both EbA-HI and EbA-BI increased by 1.87% and 0.84%, respectively, from 2003 to 2019 in the Qilian Mountain Protected Area. Nevertheless, variations in the values of these indices, as well as their factors, were evident in different areas. Higher air temperatures significantly facilitated the increase in both EbA-HI and EbA-BI. A higher degree of land use positively affected EbA-HI but negatively impacted EbA-BI. Our findings illustrate the complexity associated with EbA and elucidate the need for in-depth theoretical thinking and practical adaptation measures for efficient ecosystem management, which will help to sustain and improve both biodiversity and human well-being.}

abstract = {Being prone to dispute, airport projects involve diverse stakeholders including also national and international aviation authorities, and this complicates the dispute resolution process in these projects. Hence, decision-makers should not entirely rely on standard forms of contracts to settle disputes in airport projects. Instead, these projects necessitate a specific dispute resolution framework that meets their needs. Even though some effort has already been devoted to developing a framework for ADR selection, most of these studies neglect airport projects. Furthermore, existing studies fell short of adopting more advanced techniques such as fuzzy set logic and Fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija | Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), posing a variety of drawbacks. Thus, this study aims to guide decision-makers by developing a selection framework of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods to resolve disputes in airport projects. Firstly, the literature was reviewed comprehensively to reveal the criteria affecting the selection of ADR methods. Next, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) session was conducted with the participation of 17 experts who have diverse experiences in the dispute resolution process in airport projects to omit or validate the detected criteria obtained from the literature review. This was then followed by the Fuzzy VIKOR method to evaluate the importance of each ADR method. In the final step, sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the reliability of the results. The results confirmed that a plethora of factors governs the ADR selection process, pinpointing the need for a systematic and holistic framework. Secondly, the “Expert Determination” was determined to be the most convenient ADR method for airport projects. The “Expert Determination” was followed by the “Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB)” and “Arbitration”, respectively. Revealing the very first holistic framework concerning ADR selection for airport projects, this study significantly contributes to the dispute resolution domain. Furthermore, this proposed framework is believed to have promising benefits for the decision-makers while drafting the contract clauses in terms of ADR methods in airport projects.}

Therefore, the sustainability awareness has become an important issue in supply chain management and companies prefer to work with other companies focusing on this subject. This study presents a decision framework for sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem. The framework consists of three integrated components. First, fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach is used to calculate the weights of sustainable criteria considered in decision making process. Second, these weights are used as inputs in Taguchi Loss Functions for ranking and calculating the rating value of each supplier. The ranking values are then taken as inputs to determine the optimal order quantities that should be allocated to each supplier using bi-objective optimization. The first contribution of this study is that it presents a novel hybrid approach by integrating fuzzy DEMATEL and Taguchi loss functions for evaluating and ranking sustainable suppliers. The second contribution is that a new bi-objective model considering the issue of lost sales has been proposed for order allocation phase for the first time in literature. The illustration of the proposed framework is shown on a case study which helps decision makers to select the sustainable suppliers and determine order sizes considering lost sales.}

To deal with regular undersampled issue, we propose a novel anti-aliasing Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) interpolation method using the curvelet transform. First, we decompose the curvelet transform into two operators: a frequency-wavenumber (f-k) operator and a curvelet tiling operator. These two operators are used to respectively link time-space (t-x) domain to f-k domain, and f-k domain to the curvelet coefficients. In the f-k domain, the two boundaries for dominant dips can be identified by an angular searching within the whole frequency range. Second, we expand the two boundary dips to design a mask function that can eliminate the wraparound aliasing artefacts caused by regular undersampling. Finally, by incorporating the mask function into conventional POCS method, we are able to derive a robust anti-aliasing POCS interpolation method under the curvelet transform. With an exponential threshold model, the satisfactory interpolation result can be obtained by 10–12 iterations. The proposed interpolation method, which has no assumption for linear or quasi-linear events like a Fourier transform-based interpolation method, works for either regularly or randomly undersampled seismic data. Synthetic and real data examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.}

How these criteria impact each other has few been examined, and how to integrate the objective and subjective criteria need a comprehensive model with considering the fuzzy characteristics of the subjective criteria. This study targeted these two questions. An empirical study was adopted with hundreds of experts taking part in reviewing hundreds of Sci-Tech projects. The impacting relationships among the criteria were analyzed based on the empirical study. In order to deal with the intuitionistic fuzzy data on the subjective criteria and improve the estimation efficiency, an IVIF-BWM (best worst method under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment) was proposed by combining IVIF and the classical BWM to generate the importance weight for each criterion. The MULTIMOORA (multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form) was used to determine how to combine these criteria. At last, the proposed meta-evaluation model based on IVIF-BWM and MULTIMOORA was applied in a real case. The case study results supported the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model.}

Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers’ preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance.

abstract = {Lean manufacturing or also known as lean production has been one of the most popular paradigms in waste elimination in the manufacturing and service industry. Thus, many firms have grabbed the benefits to practice lean manufacturing in order to enhance quality and productivity. However, previous research shows that there are various sets of tools or techniques that had been adopted at a certain degree across firms according to their own understanding of lean manufacturing. The scenario resulted with varying leanness measures in order to measure lean practices. This paper describes a preliminary study in developing a conceptual model to measure leanness in manufacturing industry. Thorough literature survey, books and report analysis contribute to the main preliminary analysis of this study. The most common tools or techniques and their usefulness have been investigated. In this research, a conceptual model for leanness measurement in the manufacturing industry has been developed and designed in two main levels, namely the dimensions and the factors. There are seven main dimensions in measuring leanness in lean manufacturing practices such as manufacturing process and equipment, manufacturing planning and scheduling, visual information system, Supplier relationship, customer relationship, workforce and product development & technology. In addition, the model also shows how lean dimensions in the manufacturing system relate to eight types of wastes.}

abstract = {Sustainable supplier selection is a pressing mater in supply chain management. This paper tackles the main pain points in decision making during supplier selection and order allocation (SSS & OA) under uncertainties for a multi-item, multi-period setting, where each supplier has its own pricing policy. In the first phase, a hybrid BWM-ER method is employed for evaluating and ranking suppliers. In this method, the best worst method (BWM) for determining weights of the sustainability criteria and evidential reasoning (ER) for evaluating suppliers under uncertainty are used. Based on constraints related to demand, capacity, inventory, and allowed shortages in the next phase, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented, to make a trade-off between sustainability and economic cost. The demand is assumed to be stochastic, and there are uncertainties in the availability of suppliers during different periods. The combination of these two uncertainties is studied via a set of scenarios. A new integrated solution approach based on stochastic programming and dynamic programming to solve the bi-objective model under uncertainties is presented. The proposed approach results are compared with the results obtained via revised multi-choice goal programming and the Epsilon constraint method for a real-life case. These comparisons show that by using the new method, better and faster results are obtained. Sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the effect of quantity discounts, uncertainties in suppliers’ availability and demand. Results obtained for a real-life case study are presented and discussed.}

Electroless copper plating could be achieved in three steps, namely: (i) chemical etching with potassium permanganate solution; (ii) sensitization and activation with glucose and silver nitrate solution respectively; and (iii) electroless copper plating. Compared with the sample sensitized with stannous chloride (SnCl2), the copper plating obtained in the tin-free process showed excellent adhesion with the PRMC substrate, but had lower plating rate and conductivity. Additionally, the morphology of the copper plating was affected by the sensitization process, and the tin-free process was conducive to the formation of the large spherical copper polycrystal. Although the process is slightly complicated, the new sensitization process is so low-cost and environment-friendly that it is of great significance and could be applied into large-scale commercial manufacturing.}

The intelligence that smart, connected products embed paves the way for more sophisticated data gathering and analytics capabilities ushering in tandem a new era of smarter supply and production chains, smarter production processes, and even end-to-end connected manufacturing ecosystems. This vision imposes a new technology stack and lifecycle models to support and capacitate smart, connected products and services. The main contribution of this article is a novel PSS customization lifecycle methodology with underpinning technological solutions that enable collaborative on-demand PSS customization by supporting companies to evolve their product-service offerings by transforming them into smart, connected products. This is facilitated by the proposed lifecycle through formalized knowledge-intensive structures and associated IT tools that provide the basis for actionable PSS and production “intelligence” and a move toward more fact-based manufacturing decisions. The basic building blocks of the proposed PSS customization lifecycle and its technological stack are implemented in an integrated tool-suite and validated via large-scale industrial case studies. The PSS customization lifecycle described in this paper, paves the way for a new direction in highly-connected, knowledge-enabled smart factories, where devices, production equipment, production processes, and human-operators are connected, offering decision-making support on the basis of production knowledge and data.}

There already exist specific methods to classify and prioritize requirements, most of them based on quantitative measures. However, most of existing approaches do not consider collisions, which are an important concern in large-scale requirements sets and, more specifically, in agile development processes where requirements have to be uniquely selected for each software increment. In this paper, we propose QMPSR (Qualitative Method for Prioritizing Software Requirements), an approach that features the prioritization of requirements by considering qualitative elements that are related to the project's priorities. Our approach highlights a prioritization method that has proven to reduce collisions in software requirements rankings. Furthermore, QMPSR improves accuracy in classification when facing large-scale requirements sets, featuring no scalability problems as the number of requirements increases. We formally introduce QMPSR and then define prioritization effort and collision metrics to carry out comprehensive experiments involving different sets of requirements, comparing our approach with well-known existing prioritization methods. The experiments have provided satisfactory results, overcoming existing approaches and ensuring scalability.}

Laser light collides head-on with beam particles and either the energy of the Compton scattered electrons near the kinematic endpoint is measured or the positions of the Compton backscattered γ-rays, the edge electrons and the unscattered beam particles are recorded. A compact layout for the Compton spectrometer is suggested. It consists of a bending magnet and position sensitive detectors operating in a large radiation environment. Several options for high spatial resolution detectors are discussed. Simulation studies support the use of an infrared or green laser and quartz fiber detectors to monitor the backscattered photons and edge electrons. Employing a cavity monitor, the beam particle position downstream of the magnet can be recorded with submicrometer precision. Such a scheme provides a feasible and promising method to access the incident beam energy with precisions of 10-4 or better on a bunch-to-bunch basis while the electron and positron beams are in collision.}

abstract = {The core of a terrestrial-type planet consists of a spherical shell of rapidly rotating, electrically conducting, fluid. Such a body supports two distinct classes of quasi-geostrophic (QG) eigenmodes: fast, primarily hydrodynamic, inertial modes with period related to the rotation time scale and slow, primarily magnetic, magnetostrophic modes with much longer periods. Here, we investigate the properties of these hydromagnetic quasi-geostrophic modes as a function of non-dimensional parameters controlling the strength of the background magnetic field, the planetary rotation rate, and the amount of magnetic dissipation. We first present analytic solutions that illustrate the essential parameter dependences of the modes and provide a convenient benchmark for our numerical scheme. A comparison between known three-dimensional inertial modes in a sphere and our axially invariant QG modes shows encouraging agreement at low azimuthal wavenumbers, particularly for the slowest modes. The container geometry and background magnetic field structure are found to influence the radial structure of the modes, but not the scaling of their frequency with the control parameters. When the background magnetic field decreases toward the outer boundary in a spherical shell, QG modes tend to be compressed towards the outer boundary. Including magnetic dissipation, we find a continuous transition from diffusionless slow magnetic modes into quasi-free decay magnetic modes. During that transition (which is controlled by the magnitude of the Elsasser number), we find that slow magnetic modes weakly modified by diffusion exhibit a distinctive spiralling planform. When magnetic diffusion is significant (Elsasser number much smaller than unity), we find quasi-free decay slow magnetic modes whose decay time scale is comparable to, or shorter than, their oscillation time scale. Based on our analysis, we expect Mercury to be in a regime where the slow magnetic modes are of quasi-free decay type. Earth and possibly Ganymede, with their larger Elsasser numbers, may possess slow modes that are in the transition regime of weak diffusion, depending on the details of their poorly known internal magnetic fields. Fast QG modes, that are almost unaffected by the background magnetic field, are expected in the cores of all three bodies.}

abstract = {The ancient European mechanical clock with automata is one of the indicators of manufacturing technology, and the clocks exported to Asia offer evidence of cultural exchange at that time. The Gilded Copper Rising and Falling Pavilion Clock Inlaid with Gemstones is one of the ingenious mechanical work made in Britain and exported to China in the 18th century. Although it's well preserved in the Forbidden City in Beijing (Palace Museum currently), the internal mechanical structure is not open to the public, because of its historical value. In order to reconstruct the pagoda automaton attached to the clock, structural analysis is presented according to the text records of the other four clocks with similar automata. A systematic design approach is proposed herein. The feasible mechanisms are synthesized by going through generalization, specialization, and particularization. As the result, nine, three, and four feasible mechanisms with linkage, gear, and cam are generated, respectively. One of the feasible designs with the largest output motion range is selected, and dimensional synthesis is made to achieve the motion characteristics. Its performance is verified through prototype testing.}

This paper aimed to explore the service quality of Public Utility Vehicles (PUV) in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing the SERVQUAL dimensions. A total of 564 participants answered an online questionnaire using the convenience sampling approach, consisting of 58 questions. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to derive the causal relationships between SERVQUAL dimensions, COVID-19 safety protocol, and customer satisfaction simultaneously. Out of the six dimensions, the SEM indicated that COVID-19 protocols, tangibility, and assurance variables were found to significantly affect PUV service quality and thus, customer satisfaction. This study is one of the first complete studies that analyzed the PUV service quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could provide the government with an evaluation of the compliance of PUVs to the imposed COVID-19 protocols. Furthermore, the framework of this study could also be applied and extended in evaluating PUV worldwide.}

abstract = {Societal and economic developments pose numerous challenges for companies in the manufacturing industry. Increasing pressure on quality, time, and costs due to global competition puts entire companies at risk. Growing demands on employee performance due to individualization and increasing product variety pose a further threat. In addition, countries such as Japan and Germany face demographic change and a corresponding shortage of workers at specific skill levels. While a higher age influences the performance level of employees negatively, the shortage of qualified workers induces a lack of required skills. This mismatch between the actual capabilities of employees and the growing performance requirements is leading to an increasing number of human errors, e.g., due to stress reactions, with rising costs caused by scrappage, rework, and further quality-related problems. Therefore, this article proposes a conceptual methodology for selecting measures to prevent human errors in manual assembly lines by mitigating error-influencing factors. Firstly, a method for the selection of error-influencing factors is outlined. Subsequently, a method for the adaptive pre-selection of preventive measures is introduced. Finally, a systematic link between the error-influencing factors and the preventive measures is outlined, which allows an individual selection of measures for the most relevant error-influencing factors. The proposed methodology aims to create value for manufacturing companies by promoting profitability by preventing error-related costs, caused by things such as scrap, rework, or other quality-related issues.}

Green SCs have forced policymakers and managers to pay more attention to the environment rather than only focus on the economic aspect. Performance evaluation of complex systems, including green SCs is a critical issue in organizations. Most of the current models are unable to evaluate the performance of green SCs in an integrated framework. To address this issue in organizations, in this paper, our objective is to propose a powerful network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) to evaluate green SCs. The NDEA method is considered an effective approach to deal with complex settings including SCs. Our multiplier NDEA model for cost efficiency evaluation is presented based on the cost production possibility set (PPS). A common set of weight model based on cost PPS is formulated. The proposed model maximizes the cost-efficiency of all decision making units (DMUs), simultaneously. In our model, the common set of weights and cost efficiency of each stage and the overall cost are obtained. Finally, the developed model for assessing the sustainably of SCs in the wire and cable industry is applied. The results show how well our developed model, based on common set of weights, can evaluate the performance of green SCs compared to the classic models.}

abstract = {One challenge that product design has faced is the ongoing threat of obsolescence, where investment in an updated solution can quickly become irrelevant within months or years as technology advances. This phenomenon not only affects consumers, who may find themselves with quickly outdated devices but also poses a dilemma for designers and manufacturers who must balance constant innovation with sustainability and product durability. In this dynamic scenario, there arises a critical need to understand how design attributes impact obsolescence and how this relationship can influence the creation of more sustainable and resilient products. This paper develops a taxonomy of product design attributes influencing different types of obsolescence to address the research gap between product design and obsolescence. It investigates the significance of obsolescence types across product categories, the impact of design attributes on these obsolescences, and the role of design in product sustainability. Employing a theoretical framework combining product design and lifecycle analysis, the methodology includes a literature review and an expert survey to evaluate design attributes against obsolescence types. From the literature review, 21 design attributes were identified and evaluated by 26 industry and academia experts. The findings reveal distinct patterns of obsolescence in various product categories, emphasizing the influence of specific design attributes. The role of attributes such as upgradeability and compatibility in technological, functional, and planned obsolescence was highlighted. Limited familiarity with certain types of obsolescence among experts was acknowledged, underscoring the importance of raising awareness within the design community. These insights are critical to align product design with sustainability goals and challenging traditional product development practices. The study has significant implications for designers, manufacturers, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of understanding design choices in reducing obsolescence and promoting sustainable consumption.}

Indeed, Manufacturing Engineers exploit modelling approaches derived from Information Technology or Operations Research, but modelling means quite different things to experts of these two areas. Still, the aim is a common one: to design, implement, operate and maintain a CIM system. One of the aims of this paper is to point out the need for better integration among the disciplines which are involved in CIM. Furthermore, due to the multi-actorial and multi-disciplinary nature of CIM system development, modelling should be regarded as a support tool for communicating. This paper discusses CIM modelling as a communication process and presents a short survey on languages and formalisms, in order to put into evidence their potential use, the difficulties in learning and mastering them, and the unavoidable distortions every language casts on the object being represented.}

abstract = {Purpose
Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion and methylation of a CGG tract in the 5′ untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The estimated frequency of expanded alleles (≥55 repeats) in the United States is 1:257–1:382, but these estimates were not calculated from unbiased populations. We sought to determine the frequency of fragile X syndrome premutation (55–200 repeats) and full mutation (>200 repeats) alleles in nonselected, unbiased populations undergoing routine carrier screening for other diseases.
Methods
A previously validated laboratory-developed test using triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction was used to detect premutation and full mutation alleles in an unselected series of 11,759 consecutive cystic fibrosis carrier screening samples and 2011 samples submitted for screening for genetic diseases prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
Results
Premutations were identified in 48 cystic fibrosis screening samples (1:245) and 15 samples (1:134) from the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Adjusted for the ethnic mix of the US population and self-reported ethnicity in our screening population, the estimated female premutation carrier frequency in the United States was 1:178. The calculated frequency of full mutation alleles was 1:3335 overall, and the calculated premutation frequency in males was 1:400. Based on frequency of larger, ≥70 repeat alleles, and reported penetrance, the calculated fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome, and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency frequencies is 1:4848 and 1:3560, respectively.
Conclusion
Our calculated fragile X syndrome carrier rate is higher than previous estimates for the US population and warrants further consideration of population-based carrier screening.}

This paper investigates a method for optimizing product design V&V planning in the early stages of product development to maximize the product reliability improvement. The proposed V&V planning model considers the priorities of the failure modes based on failure rate, detectability, and consequences. The sequencing of performing V&V activities and the effectiveness of each V&V activity in reducing failure rate and improving failure detectability are also considered. The objective of the V&V optimization model is to maximize the system reliability improvement by optimally selecting a set of V&V activities. The sequencing for V&V activities is formulated using the job shop scheduling concept. The set covering problem concept is applied to assure that all critical failure modes are covered. A V&V planning example of an engine power unit development is demonstrated and the results are compared with existing planning methods, which shows the advantages of the proposed V&V planning approach.}

Simulation results indicate that if the reliability increases, the optimal logistics capability order quantity, the buyback price and all expected profits decrease.

abstract = {Manufacturing companies are increasingly moving toward delivering combinations of products and services to provide higher value to their customers. The development of such Product Service Systems (PSS) escalates in complexity when several products developed by different suppliers need to be integrated into a unique system. For first tier suppliers, it is a great challenge to model and simulate the impact of changing design variables at the micro-level on both hardware properties and governing behaviors of services over the entire life-cycle of the PSS. The paper describes a model-based approach developed to estimate the life cycle cost of a PSS hardware already at a concept design stage. The proposed approach computes the relative cost efficiency of a set of design variants using as input the data generated by the simulations run in the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) environment. The approach allows the exploration of the design space of a PSS given by the variation of the geometry of a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model, building on the computation of customized cost modules selected by a generic list of PSS cost dimensions. For each evaluated design case, the model produces as output a unique monetary figure of the cost expected to incur by owning or using the asset throughout the lifetime. The work has been conducted in collaboration with a tier-one aerospace component manufacturer, and the application of the model is exemplified through a case study related to the development of a turbine rear structure (TRS) for commercial jet engines. The approach is most suitable for the development of complex systems in which new products and components are integrated into a shared product platform. The results are discussed in relation to the current literature on PSS cost engineering, highlighting challenges to be addressed to increase cost estimation accuracy and increase uncertainty identification and awareness.}

abstract = {As a hub connecting power production and consumption, the urban power grid (UPG) is the basis for realizing the carbon–neutral goal. To ensure carbon–neutral progress, it is necessary to conduct an effective analysis of carbon–neutral potential from the UPG perspective. Given this, this paper proposes a multi-stage decision model that integrates Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) methods under the rough-fuzzy (RF) environment. Firstly, a multi-dimensional attribute system is innovatively established, and then the rough-fuzzy number is presented to assemble assessment information of groups and to manipulate internal and external uncertainties during decision process. Subsequently, the RF-DEMATEL is utilized to determine the importance-weights of the attributes, in which the interrelationships between attributes are fully considered. Finally, the RF-MARCOS is developed and applied to obtain carbon–neutral potential analysis results based on utility functions in relation to the ideal and anti-ideal solutions. A case study is conducted based on the proposed methodology, and the stability and robustness of the results are verified through sensitive and comparative analysis. This research contributes theoretically and practically to related literature by providing a systematic model capable of handling decision problems with complexity and uncertainty.}

ClientPro was developed as a Microsoft Access application, and it is designed to facilitate the effective processing of client requirements on construction projects. The methodology, development, operation and evaluation of the prototype are discussed, and it is concluded that, ClientPro is potentially useful in facilitating the systematic definition, analysis, and mapping of client requirements to design specifications. It also provides for the incorporation and prioritisation of the perspectives represented by the client, the determination of the relative importance of his/her requirements, and the early consideration of issues affecting the life cycle of a facility. Thus, it can contribute to the ultimate satisfaction of the requirements of construction clients.}

abstract = {Despite the growing importance of developing a novel business model, most previous studies on business model remain conceptual and theoretical. A paucity of empirical studies has hindered the use of the business model concept in practical purposes. Hence, this study proposes a systematic approach to new business model development (NBMD) that helps business practitioners to develop, evaluate and select the best business model to meet the business objectives. The proposed approach comprises two stages: identification of business model alternatives and business model evaluation and selection. During the first stage, a set of business model alternatives are derived by exploring all the possible combinations of a morphological matrix, and in the second stage, we conduct an evaluation and selection of a suitable business model. Morphological analysis (MA) has been employed for the derivation and aggregation of business model alternatives, and decision-making approach that integrates fuzzy extent analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods is used as an evaluation and selection tool. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of proposed approach, a case study on the development of a business model for a Telco has been presented.}

The naturalness of a real CKM matrix is studied within the framework of general multi-Higgs-doublet models with spontaneous CP violation. As an example, we discuss a specific two-Higgs-doublet model and its implications for CP asymmetries in non-leptonic neutral B-meson decays.}

abstract = {Establishing a product family enables companies leverage mass customization to meet demand from different market segments. Product family design environment can be inherently decentralized and requires a number of entities to achieve a common goal. Issues related to product platform design can be modeled as multi-objective optimization with respect to design variables, production cost and other factors. A common drawback in decentralized environments is information sharing which can reduce the quality of the decision especially under partial information or information privacy restrictions. In this paper, we present an agent-based collaborative design model and propose a decentralized coordination mechanism to facilitate decision-making. This is achieved by modeling a collaborative design environment and applying a two-phase augmented Lagrangian-based algorithm such that the decision makers achieve a common goal without having a global view of the entire design space. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism using a General Aviation Aircraft and a Universal Electric Motor product family design problem. The product designers and the platform designer act independently and each has no knowledge of the decision functions of other designers. The computational results showed that quality solutions can be obtained in decentralized environments.}

abstract = {The management of new service development (NSD) has become an important competitive concern in many service industries. However, NSD remains among the least studied and understood topics in the service management literature. As a result, our current understanding of the critical resources and activities to develop new services is inadequate given NSD’s importance as a service competitiveness driver. Until recently, the generally accepted principle behind NSD was that “new services happen” rather than occurring through formal development processes. Recent efforts to address this debate have been inconclusive. Thus, additional research is needed to validate or discredit the belief that new services happen as a result of intuition, flair, and luck. Relying upon the general distinctions between research exploitation and exploration, this paper describes areas in NSD research that deserve further leveraging and refinement (i.e. exploitation) and identifies areas requiring discovery or new study (i.e. exploration). We discuss the critical substantive and research design issues facing NSD scholars such as defining new services, choice in focusing on the NSD process or performance (or both), and specification of unit of analysis. We also examine what can be exploited from the study of new product development to further understanding of NSD. Finally, we explore one important area for future NSD research exploration: the impact of the Internet on the design and development of services. We offer research opportunities and research challenges in the study of NSD throughout the paper.}

In the first part of this work, the product-related design stages of the Product-driven Process Synthesis methodology were addressed. The concept of House of Quality was used to link both design spaces and additionally to map the product attributes onto product properties. Further, we identified the fundamental tasks to convert raw materials into a final product which led ultimately to two alternative process flow-sheets. These process flow-sheets were not obvious and hence were experimentally verified. In this work, we demonstrated that the process alternative based on combined enzymes and ultrasound improved the purity of the final product, and reduced processing time. For the selected alternative, we defined the operating window and developed an overall process design.}

abstract = {Environmental concerns related to fossil fuels utilization has developed different energy/environmental policy tools that Carbon tax is one of the important ones. There are huge debates among different political parties related to the positive and negative effects of the carbon tax on the energy and environmental policies of the countries. However, carbon tax not only can have effects on the utilization and consumption of energy sources portfolios, but it may also have negative or positive effects on the economy, industry, and social welfare of the countries that should be identified and analyzed, in particular for countries with high energy-intensive industries such as Finland. The purpose of this research is to answer the question: “How does Carbon Tax affect social welfare and emission reduction in Finland?” We use the computable general equilibrium model to analyze the impact of the carbon tax on social welfare and the rate of emission reduction. Considering the fact that Finland has several years of carbon tax policy application background, evaluation of the impact of this policy on Finland’s social-environmental structure is very valuable for other countries, especially newcomers. Our results show that despite carbon tax policy in Finland has been successful in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, however, it has negative effects on the social welfare of Finns. Therefore, an optimum level of the carbon price is recommended for future policy revision}

Bivariate correlations and one-way ANOVAs were conducted in JMP Pro 14. The results indicate that design thinking activities may be useful also for large food safety projects. Multidisciplinary collaborative workshops can generate optimism and a sense of belonging among the participants, visualization tools can contribute to simplify complex information, and empathic observation studies makes it easier to think user centric. This study is one of few that quantitatively investigate the perceived usefulness of implementing design thinking into a multidisciplinary research project, and the findings contribute to a better understanding of the perceived effects of implementing design thinking into a large complex food safety research projects.}

Several studies indicate that conflicting stakeholder requirements are a main barrier in implementing sustainable retrofits with the decision often made based purely on short-term economic grounds. However, most studies did not take into account the important role that different stakeholders can play in determining the type and extent of any retrofit measures, or develop methodologies that integrate social, environmental, economic, and technical concerns. In this research, a House of Quality (HOQ) model is developed that synthesizes differences among the stakeholders and integrates their competing objectives to establish hierarchy of retrofits that meet the stakeholder requirements in using the existing building. The developed model is tested on a decision to sustainably retrofit an existing US Navy case study building. The HOQ analysis revealed that the stakeholder type for this case study did not affect the ranking of their requirements, and in general, all 5 of the main groups of stakeholders involved in this study, agreed without persuasion that the primary reasons for implementing sustainable retrofits in each of the four main systems are to save energy, reduce costs, and adhere to policy.}
