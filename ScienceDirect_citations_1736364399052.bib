Phase transitions occur when the structure of a system changes. In magnetic materials this change may be from a high-temperature disordered phase in which the atomic magnetic moments are randomly oriented, to a low-temperature phase in which the magnetic moments are ordered in a well-defined structure. The most detailed tests of the theory of phase transitions have been performed using magnetic systems; neutron scattering techniques have also made a significant contribution to structural phase transitions. The chapter discusses the phase transitions in pure model systems. The structural phase transitions are divided into two types: the displacive transitions and the order-disorder transitions. The latter, such as the atomic ordering transition in β-brass or the ordering of the NO2 groups in the ferroelectric transition of NaN02, are similar to the magnetic transitions. They involve large motions of the atoms, which have a characteristic time that is much longer than the oscillatory time of the phonons. In contrast, the displacive transitions occur when the displacements of the atoms are small distances from their equilibrium positions in the ordered high-temperature structure. These order-order transitions are conveniently discussed by the soft-mode concept, in which the transition arises because of instability of the crystal against a particular mode of vibration. Structural phase transitions are more susceptible to the effects of a compressible lattice, impurities, and imperfections than are magnetic ones.}

His major contributions are first listed and then described in a systematic and analytical manner. The concepts underlying Taguchi's univariate quality loss functions (QLFs), his orthogonal arrays (OAs), robust designs, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and their corresponding applications to quality and process engineering are examined and described in great detail. Some of Taguchi's OAs are related to the classical (fractional) factorial designs (a field that was started by Sir Ronald A. Fisher in the early 1920s). The applications of Taguchi's robust (parameter and tolerance) designs to manufacturing engineering are illustrated through designed experiments.}

abstract = {Small inflections in plots of the total yield of secondary electrons versus primary electron energy were reported more than fifty years ago and attributed variously to thresholds for the excitation of core states, and to diffraction of the incident electrons. Although the existence of these inflections was discounted by later researchers, recent studies of the derivative of the yield leave no doubt as to their reality or their origin. The spectrum of core excitation thresholds provides information on the composition of the surface region. Near-threshold structure is related to the electronic state of the atoms. Extended fine structure above the threshold can be inverted to obtain interatomic spacings even from relatively disordered surfaces. The principal limitation in these measurements results from diffraction of the incident electron beam, which produces variations in electron reflectivity. The extreme simplicity of the equipment required makes this technique available to essentially every surface science laboratory.}

It has been observed that the Cauchy relations amongst these constants are broken due to the presence of the many body term in this potential as in the case of the second order elastic constants. It has further been demonstrated that five of the six third order elastic constants can be evaluated from the values of the sixth third order elastic constants and the second order elastic constants of the solid. Application to NaCl and KCl leads to values of the five constants which agree fairly well with the corresponding measured values.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
In a solid-catalyzed gas reaction any one of several steps may be a rate-determining step. The possibilities should be considered when only one molecule reacts. The rate-determining step could be adsorption, reaction on the surface after adsorption, or desorption. The dissociation of the molecule might or might not necessarily accompany adsorption. A surface reaction might be one of several kinds. The adsorbed molecule could isomerize or decompose on a fixed site, and either kind of step could be rate determining. In some cases reaction occurs only when two adsorbed molecules react with each other. Regardless of whether the surface reaction is monomolecular or bimolecular, the reacting molecules could possess surface mobility and not be attached to fixed sites. A desorption rate-determining step could be simple desorption from a site upon which reaction has occurred. Surface mobility could also be a factor in desorption. For example, in some cases the adsorbed molecule must move from the site of reaction to a site from which it can desorb.}

abstract = {A preliminary examination of some potential safety questions for conceptual fusion-fission hybrid reactors is presented in this paper. The study and subsequent analysis was largely based upon one design, a conceptual mirror fusion-fission reactor, operating on the deuterium-tritium plasma fusion fuel cycle and the uranium-plutonium fission fuel cycle. The major potential hazards were found to be: (a) fission products, (b) actinide elements, (c) induced radioactivity, and (d) tritium. As a result of these studies, it appears that highly reliable and even redundant decay heat removal must be provided. Loss of the ability to remove decay heat results in melting of fuel, with ultimate release of fission products and actinides to the containment. In addition, the studies indicate that blankets can be designed which will remain subcritical under extensive changes in both composition and geometry. Magnet safety and the effects of magnetic fields on thermal parameters were also considered.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter presents a melting model of pulsed-laser processing. The theoretical foundation of the melting model is developed in the chapter, with an emphasis on the aspects important for laser-processing applications. The modeling involves finite-difference or finite-element solutions of the heat diffusion equations and explicitly evaluates both the temperature dependence of the thermal properties and the possibility of melting. The success of the melting theory of pulsed-laser annealing leaves little doubt that the conceptual foundation of the modeling is basically correcting the regime of nanosecond, and probably even picosecond, laser pulses. Nevertheless, some proponents of a plasma model of pulsed-laser annealing are reluctant to concede this. The chapter discusses the interaction of intense laser radiation with a semiconducting material and concludes with a discussion of future developments in the modeling.}

This chapter describes the novel amphibian toxins, their isolation, structure, and syntheses, the phenomenon of receptors that selectively bind to specific agents. The chapter also discusses the location and function of amphibious venoms; spiropiperidines, cis-decahydroquinolines, and octahydroindolizidines; neurotoxins, receptors, and ion transport. Amphibian venoms may offer only some passive protection. The venoms are located in skin glands, in some cases in the eggs of the species, and very rarely in the bloodstream. Tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin bind at receptor site 1 and block the ion transport activity of the sodium channel. The steroidal alkaloids batrachotoxin and, to a lesser degree, veratridine and the terpinoids aconitine and grayanotoxin, bind at receptor site 2, a common binding site probably in the sodium channel, belonging to a subunit exercising control over other subunits that must interact for the various functions of the sodium channel. Batrachotoxin is the most useful probe for biochemical studies of neurotoxin receptor site 2 on the sodium channel.}

The paper provides a classification of existing approaches and unsolved problems. For the sake of pragmatism, it has been chosen to organize such classification around a specific architecture for a Negotiation Support System which is being developed within a wider research project. The aim of the paper is to show how a system for supporting negotiation between different firms should be effective and which are the problematics and the research fields involved during the development.}
