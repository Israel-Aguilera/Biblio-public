abstract = {In recent years, semiconductors have become essential components in a wide range of electronic information products. The manufacturing of semiconductors requires production in an electronic clean room. Choosing the right honeycomb structural material (HSM) can maximize the efficiency and operation of the electronic clean room. Nonetheless, selecting the optimal HSM for electronics clean rooms requires balancing tradeoffs between conflicting criteria. This study aims to develop a comprehensive evaluation criteria system for proper HSM selection. We propose a multi-criteria decision support framework based on the notion of basic uncertain linguistic information and an integrated approach that combines the Bayesian best-worst method technique with the Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE) III method. The proposed framework is used to address the HSM selection problem faced by a cross-functional team who are responsible for the design and construction of an electronics clean room. The results of the case study show that construction cost and clean ventilation capacity criteria are very important and that Sheet Molding Compound straight cylinders, a subtype of HSM, stand out from the crowd of materials. The proposed model was further subjected to sensitivity and comparative analyses to compare the current model with several existing methods to validate its advantages and confirm its validity.}

However, little or no consideration, it seems, is afforded the production workers who must produce and assemble these products. Given the conservative bent of governments, industry will have less incentive to invest in equipment which will reduce the risk of work-related injuries, or to give maximum consideration to designing the products and processes in such a manner that the risk of worker injury is minimized. One possible approach to make industries more accountable in this regard, is to utilize ISO 9000 as a vehicle for incorporating FMEA-like analysis techniques for occupational health issues and to audit every customer/supplier to assure that actions are being taken to solve any problems which have been identified. The authors suggest some strategies for implementing and controlling this type of system. Relevance to industry The concepts and methods presented here will allow product designers and process planners to not only assess the injury risk of their proposed design on the workers who must manufacture the product, but also determine the costs associated with such risks.}

Maintenance is a critical activity carried out in the use phase of the product life cycle to prolong system availability. The increasing amount of repairs and maintenance of machinery has become a burden on the environment. Therefore, green maintenance driven product design and maintenance actions are critically important; and organizations are now looking for methods and tools to assess the sustainability aspects of their design and operation. This paper presents an objective approach to evaluate green maintenance aspects of mechanical systems at its design stage and rank the design alternatives. It takes into consideration the green maintenance requirements, environment conscious attributes and their interrelationships. The evaluation problem is formulated as a multi-attribute decision-making model and solved using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach. The proposed approach starts with applying AHP method to evaluate the importance of green maintenance requirements during maintenance. Then the relationships between the requirements and design characteristics are established and the TOPSIS method is adopted to rank the design alternatives.}

abstract = {Airlines typically carry out freight transportation in a hub and spoke structure, where the movements between the outstations and the hub are served by trucks. To transport freight efficiently, air carriers must consider bundling options for shipments that are delivered at outstations and have to be moved to the hub. There are three options when it comes to bundling freight: on ‘through unit load devices’ (T-ULD) (all freight for the same flight at the hub), on ‘mixed unit load devices’ (M-ULD) (freight for different flights at the hub) and loose freight in trucks. The optimal freight bundling configuration for carriers, taking into account their main KPIs (key performance indicators), is unknown. This research formulates the problem as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, allowing carriers to decide which configuration is optimal for a given outstation. The selected KPIs (cost, (un)loading time, and quality) are formulated as mathematical functions. A new MCDM, called best worst method (BWM), is then used to identify the best configuration with respect to the three KPIs. The proposed methodology is applied to KLM Cargo to identify the best configuration for the selected outstations that supply freight to the KLM hub at Schiphol Airport. This case study shows that there are different optimal freight bundling configurations for different outstations and that trucking costs and freight handling tariffs are among the key factors in deciding which configuration is optimal.}

abstract = {In customer-driven design, reusing the design experiences of solving previous problems is a potential methodology, and the case retrieval (CR) process is a major step process, in which similarity measurement (SM) among cases is its core. However, performing the CR model with high retrieval accuracy and low computational complexity for the fuzzy, vague and imprecision customer requirements is a huge challenge for researchers and few studies attempt to research the CR model for customer-driven design. This paper proposes a new fuzzy SM (FSM) method in CR model which based on adapted Gaussian membership for customer driven design, i.e., AGFSM. In AGFSM, the adapted Gaussian membership is established based on demand information, meanwhile, the adjustment parameter is optimized via genetic algorithm (GA). Subsequently, the corresponding local similarity (LS) and global similarity (GS) are obtained. In order to find the more proper design solution, the similar case with higher suitable coefficient (SC), instead of similarity degree, is recommended as the finally design solution. Furthermore, we take power transformer design as an example to illustrate the process of the CR model with AGFSM and compare with other FSM methods to validate its superiority. As a result, the AGFSM is more efficient than previous FSM methods on the basis of retrieval accuracy and computational complexity.}

This research highlights the effect of high trade value on performance, an effective braking system effect on reliability, and engine life on durability; among two wheeler customers, a two wheeler's conformance to specifications has a positive relationship with lower maintenance during the purchasing process.

Therefore to understand GSD projects as complex systems we need to combine the state-of-the-art of GSD research, as addressed in the software engineering discipline, with results of other disciplines that study complexity (e.g. Enterprise Architecture, Complexity and Information Theory, Axiomatic Design theory). In this paper we study the complexity of GSD projects and propose an upper bound estimation of Kolmogorov complexity (KC) to estimate the information content (as a complexity measure) of project plans. We demonstrate using two hypothetical examples how good and bad project plans compare with respect to complexity, and propose the application of extended Axiomatic Design (AD) theory to reduce the complexity of GSD projects in the project planning stage, as well as to keep this complexity as low as possible during the project execution stage.}

However, it also faces huge challenges and problems such as fierce market competition, serious photovoltaic curtailment, high cost, etc. In order to promote the sustainable development of photovoltaic industry, this paper constructs an energy storage-involved photovoltaic value chain (ES-PVC) consisting of three nodes for upstream, midstream and downstream, in which photovoltaic power suppliers, battery energy storage business and electric vehicle manufacturers locate respectively. The coupling problem for node enterprises in the value chain is studied by multi-objective optimization and G1 method, which is measured eventually via a single value transformed by ideal point method. Considering the particularity of issue, the paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to fit and solve the model. A best value chain is acquired via proposed approach whose feasibility and applicability are verified through comparative analysis with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and linear assignment method (LAM) and sensitivity analysis. The implications and limitations are presented in the conclusion, aiming to provide theoretical reference for value management of photovoltaic enterprise and to get further research.}

Local comprehensive plans were quantitatively analyzed and case studies were conducted within an urbanizing lake watershed to determine how well plans support watershed protection. On average, plans are not supportive of lake water resource protection. Plan quality scores revealed a free rider problem, as scores were unexpectedly higher for non-users compared to users of Jordan Lake as a drinking water supply; in other words, local jurisdictions that benefit more from the water supply contributed less in terms of comprehensive planning to protect that supply. Core determinates of watershed protection in comprehensive plans were networks for information exchange, a civic culture supportive of collaborative governance, and a centralized role for planning. To more effectively address regional scale common-pool resources problems, we recommend that (1) state and federal governments require or incentivize coordinated planning among local governments, (2) plan quality principles be applied during creation of comprehensive plans, and (3) plan effectiveness be tracked through time. Integral with these recommendations, future research should identify and test methods and metrics to evaluate plan effectiveness and outcomes.}

However, there are limited studies considering sustainability issues and global economic aspects of the soybean supply chain design and optimization. Moreover, it is challenging to integrate many sustainability criteria into a single-stage optimization model for a soybean supply chain configuration. This research proposes a novel two-stage approach, integrating a multi-criteria decision-making technique and a new multi-objective optimization model to design and optimize a soybean supply chain network in Canada, considering sustainability and global factors. In Stage 1, several qualitative and quantitative sustainability criteria are considered to calculate the sustainability scores for the potential suppliers, using the Interval Type 2 Trapezoidal Best Worst Method. Then, the scores are used as input in Stage 2, where a new optimization model with four objective functions is formulated to design and optimize a soybean supply chain. The objective functions include maximization of total profit, created job opportunities, and suppliers' sustainability, and minimization of CO2 emissions. Then, the Pareto frontier is generated, using the augmented ε-constraint method which helps policymakers to make appropriate decisions. Furthermore, four cases are proposed and analyzed to assess the impacts of the objective functions on strategic and tactical decisions. The results show the importance of the presented method as an integrated approach, considering sustainability pillars in agri-food supply chains. In addition, the results indicate that the proposed stochastic multi-objective model can handle fluctuations in uncertain parameters.}

The originality of the proposed method lies in the use of predictive models (multivariate regression), whose coefficients are used to weigh the contribution of each upstream characteristic to predict the final characteristics. In the context of continuous improvement environments, the application of different SPC approaches to manufacturing processes were compared. The results showed that the multivariate SPC method based on partial least squares regression was superior to traditional univariate and multivariate SPC methods in terms of the predictive precision to detect downstream faults in customer characteristics. However, the use of multiple linear regression may also be an option, since the identification of what upstream characteristic is causing the out-of-control signal is simpler than that of partial least squares regression, and predictive precision in the case of each of the two methods is comparable in practical terms.}

The customer demand is allocated by using a hybrid algorithm based on the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the mixed linear integer programming (MILP) approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with computational results. Drawing to a case, a supplier S3 is identified as the best supplier by using the TOPSIS method for demand allocation under no restrictions. On the contrary, under constrained scenario, supplier S2 is selected as the best supplier by using the hybrid algorithm for demand allocation and maximum units are allocated to S2.}

A complex system is also one which evolves throughout its life cycle, interacting with the external environment. These characteristics rapidly result in a great number of configurations which must be assessed in order to identify the optimal system for the environment (using many criteria and over the whole of the life cycle). To ecodesign such a system in the early stages of the design process, we have investigated, from the literature, 3 different methodological approaches, each of which uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Approach 1 is the intuitive approach of the designer based on simple rules or on a Pareto combined with LCA. Approach 2 is based on Design of Experiments (DoE) combined with LCA and in approach 3 the Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), based on the calculation of intervals, are combined with the LCA. These three methods (Pareto/LCA, DoE/LCA and CSP/LCA) have been tested in an ecodesign project for a complex system: a hybrid passenger ferry. The results of each method are evaluated according to the following criteria: time consumed, training, exploration of fields of possibility, interpretation of results and reusability. These results show that the CSP/LCA approach has certain advantages, in particular for exploring the fields of possibilities, interpreting results and the time saving through reusing results obtained for similar systems.}

It is found that the software so developed must be free from defects / bugs. One major area that requires concentration is requirements analysis. The requirements from various stakeholders must be received and analyzed for their relevance in the final product. Some prioritization analysis is also required to consider some requirements over the others. Kano and AHP are known to help the developers in analyzing relative strengths of various requirements. However, after defining the requirements clearly, the developed product must be free of defects. SWFMEA is a technique to ensure the defect-free development of the software. Software User Review Defect Corrective Model (SURDCM), which has Kano and AHP models for requirements analysis cum prioritization and SWFMEA to detect possible defects and their respective effects, is used for development of a software product. It is expected that with the use of this model, the user involvement is increased to clearly specify the requirements and the possible defects and the effects are analyzed. This model encourages the user participation throughout the development of the product.}

To that end, we estimate a negative binomial regression based on a sample of 213 Spanish industrial establishments, defining a constant random parameter to account for non-observable heterogeneity. Our results show that the emphasis on the innovative dimensions of prevention activities, the intensive use of quality management tools, and the empowerment of workers are all factors contributing to reduce the number of injuries. By contrast, the implementation of flexible manufacturing processes is associated to higher accident rates.}

However, these methods have been criticized in the literature because they present a problem called rank reversal. In particular, analyzing this problem in relation to the TOPSIS method is still limited. Our review of the literature showed that papers are limited to analyzing cases of rank reversal by adding and removing alternatives and the solutions proposed are limited to case studies and can be improved in order to widen the scope of their application. Thus, we initially performed an analysis to determine the main cases of the rank reversal presented in the literature and to identify the main gaps in relation to the TOPSIS method. Next, we define a framework for evaluating both the TOPSIS method and the proposed model in relation to different cases of rank reversal. Finally, this paper puts forward a new method called R-TOPSIS, which proved to be robust in the experiments performed, since there were no cases of rank reversal for either the simulated cases nor for the real case used to validate it. The proposed method was also validated using statistics of dispersion and similarity to evaluate its adherence to the classic TOPSIS method.}

We find that the highest level of dishonesty occurs in settings where the parent acts alone and the dishonest act benefits the child. In this spirit, there is also an interesting, quite different, effect of children on parents’ behavior: parents act more honestly under the scrutiny of daughters than under the scrutiny of sons. This finding sheds new light on the origins of the widely documented gender differences in cheating behavior observed among adults, where a typical result is that females are more honest than males.}

The flow stress and stress-strain response are measured by a proposed method. The strain rate sensitivities and deformation mechanism are also investigated with macroscopic results. Compared with those of low strain rate tests performed at 4 × 10−3S−1, the results showed that the flow stress, strain rate sensitivities and deformation mechanisms of tungsten composite are strongly sensitive to strain rate. Microstructural observations revealed by quantitative metallographic techniques found that the deformation of tungsten grains varied with strain rate levels and that microcracks are visible under dynamic loading conditions. Fracture appearance is analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to find out the reason why both the binding strength between the tungsten grains and the binder phase, and the fracture characteristics change with increasing loading rate.}

These wide-ranging enquiries have shed light on the impact of lead-user engagement in new product development, demonstrated ways to examine service production and delivery, such as the use of ‘line of visibility’ in service blueprints and the modelling of ‘service encounters’, and have created new terms such as ‘value co-creation’. Despite these efforts, recent reviews have identified the lack of an holistic approach to new product-service system (PSS) development. This deficiency needs to be rectified, especially for complex PSS developments in regulated industries such as healthcare, as often there are multiple stakeholders posing conflicting priorities to the development team. This paper describes a novel PSS characterisation approach that supports the early-stage new PSS development process. The approach is originated from eleven healthcare case studies, involving twenty-five new products, services and PSSs. Following the methodology of action research, further cases are selected for the application of the approach to a new product, service or PSS concept in facilitated workshops. Initial implications of employing this approach in three cases are discussed in this paper.}

Then, SPs/non-sensory preferences (NSPs) are extracted from extensive online product evaluations using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and sentiment analysis. Customer preferences (CPs) are formed by combining quantifiable SPs/NSPs. Following that, CPs are used to design and distribute product components. To improve customer satisfaction, a new product development approach has been developed. Finally, a genetic algorithm is applied to the optimization model in order to determine the best product development approach.

This paper proposes the use of a time-based compositional forecasting method, which is based on the idea of exponential smoothing, to deal with the AHP priority dynamics. The proposed method is particularly useful when there is a limited number of historical data, and might be considered to be more effective and time-efficient compared to that of multivariate time series method. It was also shown that the proposed method provides much greater adaptability in modeling the AHP priorities change over time compared to that of recently developed methods in compositional data research field. The shortcoming of Saaty’s dynamic judgment approach and some limitations of the other existing methods will be discussed. Finally, to substantiate the validity of the proposed method and to give some practical insights, an illustrative case study is provided.}

A comparative case study analysis of electric utilities in three East African countries (Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) explores the drivers of utility performance. Findings show that Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited performed the worst. Kenya Power performed better, while Umeme is the most financially sustainable of the three utilities. However, this ranking among the three utilities is inconsistent across all performance measures. PSP is widespread and brings in much-needed investments in generation and distribution. Countries that restructured their power systems have reduced conflicts of interest, enabled deeper management focus, improved transparency and accountability, and built institutional capacity that translates into improved utility performance. One of our major conclusions is that despite improved governance in market-oriented power markets, consistent regulatory decision-making for cost-reflective tariffs and adequate indexation is still necessary to guarantee financial viability and sustainability.}

With the development of industries and increased diversity of their associated hazards, the importance of identifying these hazards and controlling the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks has also dramatically augmented. Currently, there is a serious need for a risk management system to identify and prioritize risks with the aim of providing corrective/preventive measures to minimize the negative consequences of OHS risks. In fact, this system can help the protection of employees’ health and reduction of organizational costs. Method: The present study proposes a hybrid decision-making approach based on the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), and Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) for assessing and prioritizing OHS risks. After identifying the risks and determining the values of the risk assessment criteria via the FMEA technique, the attempt is made to determine the weights of criteria based on their causal relationships through FCM and the hybrid learning algorithm. Then, the risk prioritization is carried out using the MOORA method based on the decision matrix (the output of the FMEA) and the weights of the criteria (the output of the FCM). Results: The results from the implementation of the proposed approach in a manufacturing company reveal that the score at issue can overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional Risk Priority Number(RPN) in the conventional FMEA, including lack of assignment the different relative importance to the assessment criteria, inability to take into account other important management criteria, lack of consideration of causal relationships among criteria, and high dependence of the prioritization on the experts’ opinions, which finally provides a full and distinct risk prioritization.}

abstract = {The construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries worldwide due to deadly fatalities and accidents recorded yearly. Though many countries have established and implemented safety programs, the situation does not seem to have been mitigated. This study aims at developing a risk assessment approach that can be used to enhance the safety performance of construction projects. The study has employed pair-wise comparisons and weighting-by-ranking surveys to establish risk scores and weights for the various construction accidents, and their potential causes. Data has been collected from safety professionals in 15 large construction sites across the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that the type of accident with the highest risk score is “falling objects”, while the most significant cause is excessive winds on the project site. The developed approach was applied on an on-going car park construction project. Results showed that slips, trips and falls had the best safety performance. Furthermore, based on six sigma evaluation, the average project safety performance was at 2.33-sigma which implies that 228,739 accidents may occur in every million opportunities. The paper also provided recommendations to improve the safety performance of the case study.}

abstract = {Purpose
The current research examines the utility of risk terrain modeling (RTM) in developing an aggregate neighborhood risk of crime (ANROC) measure. RTM is often employed at the micro-place, forecasting future crime by street segment from attributes of the physical environment. Controlling for concentrated socioeconomic disadvantage and residential stability, we examine the ability of RTM to forecast neighborhood-level violent crime rates in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Methods
Grounded in the extant literature and our knowledge of the area, we identified 14 risk factors expected to influence violent crimes. Once a RTM was constructed on 2013 violent crimes, the risk of crime per cell was averaged by neighborhood (Census tract), developing an aggregate neighborhood risk of crime measure. The ANROC measure was used to predict 2014 neighborhood violent crime rates.
Results
This measure significantly increases the understanding of variation in neighborhood violent crime rates. The regression analyses indicated all three measures were significant predictors of neighborhood violent crime rates in Little Rock.
Conclusions
The overall pattern of results supported our contention that the development of a macro- or neighborhood-level measure reflecting risk for criminal opportunities contributes substantively to the neighborhoods and crime literature.}

These numbers are generally attained from past experience and engineering judgments, and this way of risk assessment sometimes leads to inaccuracies and inconsistencies during priority numbering. Fuzzy logic approach is preferable in order to remove these deficiencies in assigning the risk priority numbers. In this study, a fuzzy-based FMEA is to be applied first time to improve the purchasing process of a public hospital. Results indicate that the application of fuzzy FMEA method can solve the problems that have arisen from conventional FMEA, and can efficiently discover the potential failure modes and effects.

These product EoL strategies need to be considered early during product design in order to reduce the total lifecycle cost, minimize environmental impact, and enhance overall product sustainability. Considering the implementation of such EoL strategies across multiple lifecycles of a product will enable maximum recovery of the materials and embedded energy from previous lifecycle products for use in subsequent lifecycle products. Such practices can help companies increase global manufacturing competitiveness and promote corporate social responsibility for more sustainable economic growth. However, a multi-lifecycle based approach to product configuration design optimization, simultaneously considering conflicting objectives, has not been well addressed in previous studies. In this study, a multi-lifecycle based methodology is proposed to solve multi-objective product configuration design problems considering conflicting economic and environmental objectives. The methodology addresses issues across all the lifecycle stages, from extracting raw materials to product EoL recovery (i.e., pre-manufacturing, manufacturing, use, and post-use), and the entire demand cycle. The multi-objective optimization problem can be solved by introducing a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II using which various product design solutions can be generated by considering the tradeoff between several objectives. The proposed methodology is implemented on an industrial case study for the configuration design of toner cartridges. The Pareto optimal solutions yield better economic and environmental performances compared to the performance of the base toner cartridge. The results show that following the multi-lifecycle based approach to implement EoL strategies (i.e., reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling) could provide over 20% savings in total lifecycle cost, total global warming potential, and total water use in comparison to the same product configuration made up with entirely new components.}

Two flexible time horizon project portfolio selection models are proposed. In the two proposed models, some realistic decision criteria are taken into consideration including risk control over bankruptcy to avoid a possibility of bankruptcy at each period, project start time constraint and reinvestment strategy. Then, a novel genetic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed models. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the application of the two proposed models and illustrate the effectiveness of the designed solution algorithm.}

Most organizations use sub-optimal VVT processes and methods. The literature does not offer an effective approach for associating VVT methods to VVT activities in order to satisfy customer and engineering requirements. In many large and complex projects, the project manager faces the dilemma of how best to validate and verify customer and engineering requirements, respectively. In many cases, decisions are made in an intuitive manner. For a project with a small amount of requirements (e.g., design of a new chair, table, or a simple toy), optimum decisions for VVT methods to be included within the project are feasible. For projects with large amount of requirements, for example, design of a new payload (e.g., captive carriage of a fuel tank, camera pod or other equipment) on an aircraft, a structured process to evaluate the overall impact of VVT methods implemented in order to satisfy those requirements, and the risk involved by performing these and not other methods, is necessary. This paper proposes a model for selecting an appropriate VVT approach depending on the phase or the level of the product in the system hierarchy; the model is independent of project size or precedence. We present an analytical model that not only structures the decision process but also outputs the optimal VVT methods given Cost and Risk constraints. The analytical model was formulated as an optimization problem, where a function that associates Quality derived from incorporating VVT methods is maximized subject to Cost and/or Risk constraints. The use of the model is demonstrated on a sample problem.}

In order to achieve this goal, this study identifies environmental criteria for use in assessing and selecting green suppliers of the furniture industry; then, the study directs readers towards a successful implementation of GSCM practices. The proposed methodology uses a hybrid Entropy-TOPSIS-F framework to weight the criteria and select the supplier with the best environmental performance. The fuzzy approach is integrated with Shannon's Entropy and the TOPSIS method to deal with uncertainty in the decision-making process. To show the applicability and results of the proposed framework, we collected 32 experts' information from the furniture industry about the environmental criteria that are more suitable for evaluation and selection of suppliers in this sector. A real case involving the evaluation, based on the defined criteria, of three potential suppliers by three managers of a furniture industry was discussed. According to the findings, “Management Commitment to GSCM”, “Ecodesign” and “Environmental management system” are the first three criteria in the ranking of selection of sustainable suppliers. In addition, of the three potential suppliers of the case, supplier A1 presented superior environmental performance. A sensitivity analysis is performed to test the stability of the Entropy-TOPSIS-F approach and to verify the robustness of the proposed framework.}

A first phase involves generating a high number of potential eco-innovative R&D projects that are then analyzed and assessed using an appropriate multi-criteria grid. Three structured filters enable an informed selection of the most promising projects that will then make up a balanced R&D project portfolio.

The material selection problem is associated with design and manufacturing problems which have been widely investigated. This study develops a hybrid fuzzy decision-making model which combines the fuzzy weight average (FWA) with the fuzzy inference system (FIS) for material substitution selection in the electronics industry. FWA is employed to select a substitute material in an uncertain environment, while FIS is used for reasoning purposes. FWA with α-cuts arithmetic (FWAα-cut) is a popularly technology in decision-making problems. However, FWAα-cut may result in the following unanticipated situations: (1) unclear decision situations; (2) undecided results expressed by fuzzy membership functions; and (3) high computational complexity. Therefore, a fuzzy weight average with the weakest t-norm (FWATω) is designed as an alternative method for group decision making. In contrast to traditional FWA methods, FWATω obtains more visible fuzzy results for decision makers with lower computational complexity, and can provide exacter estimation by the weakest t-norm operations in uncertain environment. Thus, the proposed hybrid fuzzy decision-making model imitates an expert’s experiences and can estimate substitution purchasing in various statuses. A real material substitution selection case is employed to examine the feasibility of the proposed model; experimental results reveal that the proposed model performs better than the traditional FWA model in coping with material substitution selection problems.}

The success rate is defined as the percentage of launched products that during the last three years have proved successful according to companies. The model for describing and testing the success rate in the individual companies is a multiple regression model, inspired by a literature review on product development success and based on experience obtained from qualitative surveys among Danish food processing companies. The initial model building starts with 21 explanatory variables, and the analyses result in a regression model with nine significant explanatory variables describing the success rate. The resulting determinants for success are grouped into marketing activities to promote new products, company competencies, management support, usage of customer information and calculations of the likelihood of success before introducing products to the market.}

abstract = {Background: The microtubule network, upon which transport occurs in higher cells, is formed by the polymerization of α and β tubulin. The third major tubulin isoform, γ tubulin, is believed to serve a role in organizing this network by nucleating microtubule growth on microtubule-organizing centers, such as the centrosome. Research in vitro has shown that γ tubulin must be restored to stripped centrioles to regenerate the centrosomal functions of duplication and microtubule nucleation. Results We have re-examined the localization of γ tubulin in isolated and in situ mammalian centrosomes using a novel immunocytochemical technique that preserves antigenicity and morphology while allowing increased accessibility. As expected, α tubulin was localized in cytoplasmic and centriolar barrel microtubules and in the associated pericentriolar material. Foci of γ tubulin were observed at the periphery of the organized pericentriolar material, as reported previously, often near the termini of microtubules. A further and major location of γ tubulin was a structure within the proximal end of the centriolar barrel. The distributions were complementary, in that α tubulin was excluded from the core of the centriole, and γ tubulin was excluded from the microtubule barrel. Conclusion We have shown that γ tubulin is localized both in the pericentriolar material and in the core of the mammalian centriole. This result suggests that γ tubulin has a role in the centriolar duplication process, perhaps as a template for growth of the centriolar microtubules, in addition to its established role in the nucleation of astral microtubules.}

abstract = {A flow mathematical model with multiple horizontal wells considering interference between wells and fractures was established by taking the variable width conductivity fractures as basic flow units. Then a semi-analytical approach was proposed to model the production performance of full-life cycle in well pad and to investigate the effect of fracture length, flow capacity, well spacing and fracture spacing on estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Finally, an integrated workflow is developed to optimize drilling and completion parameters of the horizontal wells by incorporating the productivity prediction and economic evaluation. It is defined as nested optimization which consists of outer-optimization shell (i.e., economic profit as outer constraint) and inner-optimization shell (i.e., fracturing scale as inner constraint). The results show that, when the constraint conditions aren't considered, the performance of the well pad can be improved by increasing contact area between fracture and formation, reducing interference between fractures/wells, balancing inflow and outflow between fracture and formation, but there is no best compromise between drilling and completion parameters. When only the inner constraint condition is considered, there only exists the optimal fracture conductivity and fracture length. When considering both inner and outer constraints, the optimization decisions including fracture conductivity and fracture length, well spacing, fracture spacing are achieved and correlated. When the fracturing scale is small, small well spacing, wide fracture spacing and short fracture should be adopted. When the fracturing scale is large, big well spacing, small fracture spacing and long fracture should be used.}

However, there is a research gap regarding whether such a simple approach can adequately model uncertainty. This paper proposes a new approach to handling interval data in the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method based on the cartesian product of boundaries. This approach is compared with the most popular extension proposed by Jahanshahloo. In this work, two study cases taken from the literature were analyzed.

The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to supply chains, underscoring the critical need for resilience. However, there is no clear definition of customer-oriented maritime supply chain resilience (MSCR) during pandemic. This study proposes a definition of MSCR in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the needs of customers (i.e., freight service continuity and freight rate stability). The study aims to investigate the hierarchical and causal relationships among MSCR enablers and classify them into driving and dependence power, using an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that combines Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), fuzzy Matriced Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC), and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). A total of eighteen MSCR enablers during the pandemic are identified through literature review and experts’ opinions. The results of the study manifest that the most influential enabler is the redundancy plan, while freight service continuity and freight rate stability are determined to be the most significant and resultant enablers. The proposed approach has the potential to assist decision-makers in identifying the critical factors that require focused attention to enhance MSCR in the future.}

However, P-DSP solving (P-DSPS) is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, which is context sensitive in solution objects-attributes and chaos in the decision process of manufacturing knowledge collaboration and reuse. To alleviate these limitations, this paper presents a novel triple deep workflow model for P-DSPS. Driven by a wicked task query, the proposed workflow of P-DSPS (WP-DSPS) has the function to retrieve similarity-based alternatives from domain knowledge driven solution flow (KSF) and to evaluate with expert knowledge collaboration from knowledge driven decision flow (KDF) based on utility theory under the task event driven control flow (ECF) strategy and operation logic. In the view of alternative adaption, a domain knowledge ontology-based degree of similarity (DoS) determines the P-DSPS alternatives width, a utility function-based degree of decision (DoD) determines alternatives quality, and a belief-based knowledge fusion technique is used to synthesize decision conflicts with a consensus degree (CD). To support the proposed models, a workflow-based system prototype is proposed and validated in two case studies.}

Without creativity in design there is no potential for innovation. A complete design process for product innovation must include problem analysis and idea generation simultaneously. However, both Axiomatic Design (AD) and Theory of Solving Inventive Problems (TRIZ) techniques have their own advantages and drawbacks. There is the attribute of complementarity between AD and TRIZ in practical application. Based on AD and TRIZ, this paper presents a novel hybrid-compact design matrix by integrating problem analysis and idea generation approaches into the conceptual design stage for new product innovation. Despite the recognized importance of innovative design, there is a lack of systematic and effective design process that can cover all conceptual design activities. To address this gap, a useful and powerful hybrid model of the problem-solving is created for innovative product design, depending on the capability of AD detailed problem analysis and the expertise of TRIZ innovative idea generation. Finally, a case study of designing a new elderly rehabilitation equipment (ERE) is used to demonstrate the proposed method and the results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. This hybrid-compact design matrix can really help designers generate more creative outcomes in NPD.}

The aims of this research are to identify those negative impacts induced by foreign workers in the Malaysian construction market and to determine strategies in minimizing these negative impacts. Data were collected through a structured interview and survey. The questionnaires were delegated to professionals in construction projects who have direct contacts with foreign workers. Only respondents from those companies registered under the CIDB grade G7 were chosen for this survey. There were 117 sets of questionnaires completed and analyzed through the structured interviews. The three principal factors attracting foreign workers to the Malaysian construction market are “Preference of the employers”, “Lifestyle and working conditions”, and “Unattractiveness of the career pathway”. The main negative impacts induced by foreign workers are “Over-dependence on foreign workers”, “Increment in criminal activities or social problems”, and “Existence of illegal workers”. This research proposes that strategies such as “Attract local workers into the construction industry”, “Industrialized Building Systems”, “Eliminate illegal migration”, and “Improve governance structure” would be successful in minimizing negative impacts induced by foreign workers.}

The understanding of information usefulness was found to be affected by business priorities and goals, internal competence, in addition to function and professional training. The competent use and exploitation of relevant environmental information in product development has the potential to add value to products beyond functionality, quality, and cost, and hence in general enhance firms' competitiveness.}

abstract = {In engineering design, the decision to select an optimal material has become a challenging task for the designers, and the evaluation of alternative materials may be based on some multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods. However, the current methods for material selection may induce the information losing and cannot represent the real preference of decision maker precisely. Therefore, in this paper, inspired by the idea of the intuitionistic linguistic variables, we define a new fuzzy variable called uncertain membership linguistic variable (UMLV) which composes two linguistic variables and membership degrees of elements to the linguistic variables. Meanwhile, the operational laws, score function, accuracy function and comparison rules of the UMLV are defined. Then, some aggregation operators are developed for aggregating the uncertain membership linguistic information such as the uncertain membership linguistic weighted average (UMLWA) operator, the uncertain membership linguistic weighted geometric (UMLWG) operator, the uncertain membership linguistic ordered weighted average (UMLOWA) operator and the uncertain membership linguistic ordered weighted geometric (UMLOWG) operator, and some desirable properties of these operators are discussed. Based on the proposed operators, an approach is proposed for material selection problems under uncertain membership linguistic environment. Finally, two numerical examples for material selection are given to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.}

The proposed approach considers the future trends of various customer responses and service concept strategies of firms by using ABS, generating a more accurate concept.

In the present study, pulsed field gradient NMR was used to study the effects of calcium binding and hydration on carp parvalbumin. Carp parvalbumin is known to undergo large changes in tertiary structure with calcium loading. The diffusion coefficient is a sensitive guide to changes in molecular shape and in the present study the large changes in tertiary structure were clearly reflected in the measured diffusion coefficient upon calcium loading. The (monomeric) calcium-loaded form had a diffusion coefficient of 1.4 × 10−10 m2 s−1 at 298 K, which conforms with the structure being a nearly spherical prolate ellipsoid from X-ray studies. The calcium-free form had a significantly lower diffusion coefficient of 1.1 × 10−10 m2 s−1. The simplest explanation consistent with the change in diffusion coefficient is that the parvalbumin molecules form dimers upon the removal of Ca2+ at the protein concentration studied (1 mM).}

The possibility to encode into Sπ@ several bio-inspired, compartmentalised languages demonstrates its expressive power and flexibility. The calculus is accompanied by an extended version of Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm, able to handle multiple compartments with varying volumes. An enhanced formalisation of the algorithm is also presented, in order to provide efficient simulation in the presence of a high number of compartments and reactions.}

Unfortunately, classical methods such as Integrated Product Development (IPD), Concurrent Engineering (CE), and Simultaneous Engineering (SE) were developed for re-engineering of existing products, and have written reports and project reviews at discrete points (at the gates) as feedback principles, which for all types of development means fragmented information, delayed information, and reactive management. Dynamic Product Development (DPD) has a different mindset and is the product concept developed as long as a project runs and not just before engineering starts. Feedback is in DPD based on management participation for immediate and qualitative information, which facilitates control and guidance in real time, reducing unwanted surprises to low levels. Frequent solution iteration (making almost right and quickly testing the solutions) is in DPD important, which is opposite to classical methods. High demands on creativity, development time, usability, cost, and quality have in practical tests shown to be satisfied using DPD.}

abstract = {Assessing and ranking private health insurance companies provides insurance agencies, insurance customers, and authorities with a reliable instrument for the insurance decision-making process. Moreover, because the world’s insurance sector suffers from a gap of evaluation of private health insurance companies during the COVID-19 outbreak, the need for a reliable, useful, and comprehensive decision tool is obvious. Accordingly, this article aims to identify insurance companies’ priority ranking in terms of healthcare services in Turkey during the COVID-19 outbreak through a multi-criteria performance evaluation methodology. Herein, alternatives are evaluated and then ranked as per 7 criteria and assessments of 5 experts. Experts’ judgments and assessments are full of uncertainties. We propose a Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) technique under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment to rank insurance companies. The outcomes yielded ten insurance companies ranking in terms of healthcare services in the era of COVID-19. The payback period, premium price, and network are determined as the most crucial factors. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the proposed methodology’s stability and effectiveness. The introduced approach met the insurance assessment problem during the COVID-19 pandemic very satisfactory manner based on sensitivity analysis findings.}

abstract = {In the industrial 4.0 era, the development of an intelligent manufacturing business model is driven by satisfying customer needs and intelligent algorithms. Enterprises are desirous of adapting a product to the personalized needs of customers to the maximum possible extent. Thus, they increase production configuration diversity, and this leads to increased cost and less efficiency. In order to improve the economy and efficiency of production, this paper proposes an intelligent type-decreased mass customized product configuration method with an improved fuzzy clustering algorithm that combines the Kano’s model and social inertia. The Kano’s model is improved, and social inertia is introduced into the product configuration to adapt to customer psychology and gain better configuration results. We apply this intelligent proposed algorithm to the design of a tablet PC and verify that the improved algorithm is operable and effective in dealing with customer demands and decreases in the variety of products.}

The traditional NPD analysis method determines the solution using the membership function of fuzzy sets which cannot treat negative evidence. The advantage of vague sets, with the capability of representing negative evidence, is that they support the decision makers with the ability of modeling uncertain opinions. In this paper, we present a new method for new-product screening in the NPD process by relaxing a number of assumptions so that imprecise, inconsistent and uncertain ratings can be considered. In addition, a new similarity measure for vague sets is introduced to produce a ratings aggregation for a group of decision makers. Numerical illustrations show that the proposed model can outperform conventional fuzzy methods. It is able to provide decision makers (DMs) with consistent information and to model situations where vague and ill-defined information exist in the decision process.}

abstract = {Recently, large companies have shown a growing tendency to enhance the reliability and sustainability of their supply chains to increase customers’ satisfaction in terms of on-time fulfillment of demands and to be compatible with environmental regulations. Therefore, finding the best approaches to achieve companies’ goals is a crucial concern in supply chain management, and the majority of organizations prefer to cooperate with reliable and sustainable companies. In designing a supply chain, the supplier selection problem, order size identification, and order allocation are midterm decisions that are needed to be made separately. To this end, three levels of the supply chain, i.e., suppliers, central warehouses, and wholesalers are considered. In the first level, to address the sustainable supplier selection problem, a novel hybrid approach based on the fuzzy logic is implemented. This approach applies the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to ranking criteria and sub-criteria, the fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is applied to identification of the relationships among the main criteria, and the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to prioritizing the suppliers. After prioritizing the suppliers, the obtained weights are considered as the input of a tri-objective model designed to optimize the proposed supply chain. The objectives are minimization of the total cost of the chain, maximization of the weighted value of products by taking the account of suppliers’ priorities, and maximization of the reliability of the supply chain. Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) method is then used to deal with multi-objectiveness. To assess the applicability of the suggested methodology, a case study of the lamp supply chain was considered and solved using GAMS/CPLEX solver and optimal policies based on suppliers’ sustainability. The reliability of the supply chain was tested, and sensitivity analyses were also performed on the main parameters of the model.}

abstract = {Reduced product lifespan results in accelerated flow of materials and ultimately more waste. Rapid technology cycles, frequently changing consumer preferences and increasing market competition, provide consumers with an opportunity to use products with more functions and better quality at a cheaper price. Consequently, these products quickly become technologically, psychologically, or economically obsolete—even before the actual end of their physical life/economic value—resulting in shorter product life cycles. These products are often disposed as landfill. In this context, it can be argued that reduced product lifespan has a significant impact toward, both the environment and the economy. To address this issue, our study investigates the concept of upgradability while exploring its potential as a product lifetime extension strategy. Several research papers regarding product upgradability have been published in the past in a variety of settings/domains. However, the collective contributions of these papers have yet to be summarized in order to provide a platform of knowledge for furthering the research on upgradability. To contribute to the body of knowledge, this article aims to identify, interpret, and summarize the current literature available on product upgradability. First results indicate growing interest and promising potential of upgradability as a product lifetime extension strategy, especially given the increasing importance of a product's middle of life phase in the context of Product-Service Systems (PSS). Additionally, upgradability facilitates the implementation of the circular economy, the dissemination of PSS, as well as remanufacturing approaches. However, our findings show that research on upgradable PSS is still dominated by theoretical work and more empirical research is necessary to further establish this concept. In terms of future work, there is a clear need to develop upgradeable PSS-specific design methodologies as well as associated sustainable business models.}

This manuscript proposes the framework of a reliability analysis based on online reviews, and combines the statistical reliability analysis with current text mining technology. The proposed method adopts lexicon-based text mining technology to extract the failure-related customer knowledge from product users’ online reviews. Using the information on the symptom and time of each failure experienced by customers, we classify the failure for each component and analyze the reliability using the estimated parameters of failure distributions. A comparative analysis is proposed to eliminate the uncertainty accompanying the review information. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated by a case study of two similar mobile phone products. The results indicate that the consideration of failure distribution affects the analytical results significantly, and that the type of components, rather than the product model, has a greater impact on the product reliability.}

For the particular case of one population and one spatial dimension the general model is reduced to analytically tractable PDE with polynomial nonlinearity up to 4th order. We investigate this particular case and obtain two kinds of solutions: (i) approximate solution for small value of the ratio between the coefficient of diffusion and the wave velocity and (ii) exact solutions which describe nonlinear kink and solitary waves. In an appropriate phase space the kinks correspond to a connection between two states represented by a saddle point and a stable node. Finally we derive conditions for the asymptotic stability of the obtained solutions.}

A variety of quantitative selection procedures have been developed to solve this issue, so that a systematic evaluation can be made. This paper seeks to address the following questions: (1) what is the contribution of the literature in the field of screening and choosing the materials? (2) What are the methodologies/systems/tools for material selection of engineering components? (3) Which approaches were prevalently applied? (4) Is there any inadequacy of the approaches?

abstract = {This research seeks to investigate the effects of a Group Model Building approach on the sustainability knowledge base prior to the weighting of design requirements. Current practice shows that the knowledge about sustainability impacts and implications on other design objectives often is limited and dispersed among decision-makers. Including sustainability criteria in needs and requirements, therefore, tend to rely on limited knowledge and decision-support, leading to decision-makers often prioritizing design objectives that they are more experienced with. The aim of this research was to capture and discuss effects on team alignment of contextual sustainability understanding from co-modeling impacts and implications of sustainability on other design objectives. The research question guiding the study is ‘what are the effects of a group model building approach on early sustainability design decisions?’. A mixed-methods research, structured according to four assumptions, was designed to analyze effects quantitatively and qualitatively. The assumptions were that the proposed approach helps design teams foster an improved contextual sustainability understanding, align the view of the relative importance of sustainability, identify suitable sustainability improvement, and increase the knowledge maturity of their design decisions. The results triangulation showed that the participants showed signs of improved sustainability understanding of their design projects and that improvement actions were identified from applying the approach. A statistically relevant converging effect could be found on the team alignment of the weighting of sustainability criteria but not on the knowledge maturity. These findings are discussed to conclude on main contributions, limitations, and areas for future work.}

This study is composed of two phases: the first phase establishes the modular architecture, and taking a bicycle as the case study, applies the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) to modularize and cluster parts, and then models the connecting relations between the parts numerically using a Disassembly Effort Index (DEI). The second step involves the development of a product family using cluster analysis to divide the experimental samples and the employment of an Analytic Network Process (ANP) to obtain the optimal weight performance of the modules after establishing the market segmentation model. Results of the case study establish four product families and address construction performance of both the common and independent modules between the product families.}

abstract = {Due to growing concerns about electronic waste (e-waste), manufacturers are constantly pressured to adopt sustainable product development. In this regard, a product-service system (PSS) is a circular economy business model that offers a potential solution. Consumers are considered to play a vital role as key stakeholders in waste management and PSS. Although a substantial amount of research has been conducted on the consumer-facing sustainability aspects of PSS, most studies have neglected waste management in product-oriented PSS. On the other hand, research has either discussed sustainability theoretically or used traditional methods such as surveys to obtain consumers' opinions regarding the functionality of PSSs and the sustainability of their programs. Consequently, in the present study, the success of product-oriented PSSs in various aspects of waste management is evaluated utilizing a method centered around social media as the primary source of consumer feedback through machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The novelty of this study stems from its determination of the significance and level of consumer satisfaction over an extended period to identify major topics among consumer opinions on social media. The proposed method was used in Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) to evaluate leading corporations, such as Apple, Samsung, and Google. In addition, the Delphi method was implemented, and the reasons behind extracted trends are discussed based on experts' opinions. The results indicate that ‘cost,’ ‘trust,’ ‘convenience,’ ‘awareness and advertisement,’ ‘benefits,’ and ‘data privacy and security’ were the major topics identified. Moreover, ‘cost’ was the most important factor in determining whether consumers participate in waste management programs. Finally, this study can provide businesses with a six-year guide on how consumers have responded to their programs and concepts regarding WEEE.}

abstract = {With the increase of environmental concerns in recent years and the prevalence of such issues, which originate mainly from large industries and manufacturing plants, green supply chain management (GSCM) issues have been given special attention among researchers. GSCM is a group of management applications integrating supply chain management with criteria related to environment and supplier selection with the purpose of reducing environmental pollution caused by processes involved in a company supply chain. In this research the main contributions is to draw a decision-making structure addressing the applicability of the green supplier selection (GSS) and order allocation (OA) problem in an Iranian Oil refinery company. A combination of Cloud-PROMETHEE along with using GBWM was taken into account for GSS as the first phase and MCGP method for OA as the second phase, in order to solve the GSSOA problem. The proposed technique lets the vagueness and uncertainty of experts' judgments be obtained by assisting uncertain linguistic variable derived from the cloud model. Furthermore, the group best-worst method (GBWM) obtains the optimal criteria weights by forming a nonlinear programing model and the prioritizing of nominated suppliers is established using the PROMETHEE method with the possibility to pick a distinct preference function for each criterion and draw a graph of supplier preferences. At last, MCGP method was applied considering with the possibility of multi-choice aspiration levels (MCAL) for each goal. The suggested model illustrated with actual figures in an oil refinery to provide insight to decision-makers of green supplier selection and order allocation. To do so, initially nine criteria have been derived after vast research on literature and experts’ opinions. Then the suppliers was successfully evaluated with considering uncertainties and randomness in a group of decision maker judgments. The order allocation was also completed by minimizing total cost and delays and maximizing purchase using results of supplier ranking in the first phase. Results have shown that the supplier with better ranking in GSS is preferred in allocating orders. A sensitivity analysis then performed and confirmed that the suggested method is highly stable against different changes in the data. The proposed method was also compared with the basic MCGDM cloud model and the method is approved. Finally, managerial implications and conclusions for additional researches are demonstrated.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the business environment is characterized by great uncertainty and variability. In this environment, information technology (IT) has proved to be an important strategic ingredient for the creation of competitive advantage. This role of IT has been widely accepted during the past few years [Feeny D. Creating and sustaining competitive advantage with IT. In: Earl M, editor. Information management the strategic direction. Oxford, 1990; Ives B. Wingtip Courriers, Southern Methodist University Case Study #SMY/MIS/90-01, Edwin L. Cox School of Business, Dallas, TX, January 1990]. In the new era of production, strategic priorities rather than a cost contained focus have proved to be important for competition, namely: quality, dependability, flexibility, customer service, after sale service, supply chain management, etc. IT proved to be vital for successful competition as it can facilitate the attainment of these strategic targets. In this paper, the impact of IT on financial performance for the different types and levels of business strategy is examined. After the clustering of firms according to their strategic priorities, the effect of IT on financial performance is estimated. To do this a cross-sectional study was held in the field of Greek manufacturing firms that apply advanced IT, in order to explore which, how and in what level manufacturing priorities have been adopted. For that purpose, cluster analysis and VACOR algorithm were used, to distinguish clusters of firms and estimate the effect of IT on financial performance, for each type and level of strategic choice. Return on invested capital (ROIC) has been used as a criterion of performance in order to incorporate the effect of cost, revenues and profits. It was found that the effect of IT on financial performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize the higher level of flexibility strategy and the middle level of cost strategy. On the contrary, the effect of IT on performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize a lower level of quality and innovation strategy. Further discussion of these results and conclusions were drawn.}

abstract = {Recent market transition from mass production to mass customization forces manufacturers to design products that meet individual requirements. In order to address the high cost of this practice, manufacturers develop product families with a common platform, whose variants are designed to meet different customer demands. Parallel to this transition, the dynamics of the market forces designers to develop products composed of modules that are standardized as much as possible across products, thus can be more resilient than complete designs in a changing world. Starting from an original set of different components, our method designs a modular common platform and additional modules, shared by subsets of the designs, from which variants are composed. We applied the method to the layout design of a set of products. Consequently, the geometric aspect of the product family optimization is emphasized, but functional aspects related to the product features and to customer needs are also addressed due to their manifestation in the layout. The design search space is explored using shape grammar rules that alter component geometry and therefore, functionality. The search for optimal design is performed using simulated annealing. Given different objective formulations or parameter settings, the method can be used to explore the solution space. A simple example problem demonstrates the feasibility of the method.}
