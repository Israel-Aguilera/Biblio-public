abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) is the product development process to maximize customer satisfaction. The engineering design characteristics related to product performance are specified for this purpose. For dealing with the fuzzy nature in the product design processes, fuzzy approaches are applied to represent the relationships between customer requirements (CRs) and engineering design requirements (DRs) as well as among the DRs. A new measure for evaluating the fuzzy normalized relationships is derived. A fuzzy model is formulated to determine the fulfillment level of each DR for maximizing the customer satisfaction under the resource limitation and the considerations of technical difficulty and market competition. The producing ranges of fulfillment level of each DR and those of customer satisfaction can provide the QFD team with more information. An example is used to illustrate the model.}

In spite of its achievements so far, QFD does not sufficiently link engineering to marketing and marketing science. The QFD procedure takes neither the development of market orientated or constructional product concepts, nor the coordination of both into account, although they play an important role in product definition. In order to overcome this and other deficiencies of the traditional QFD method, the author develops the process model of ‘Integrated Concept Development’ (ICoDe). It is proposed to fill the gap between marketing science and engineering by consequently relating market orientated concept development and testing to the House of Quality concept of QFD. The ICoDe process is described by refering to a ‘simulated’ application example of a wind turbines concept development.}

When embracing agility, important questions must be asked. What precisely is agility and how can it be measured? How can one adopt the appropriate agile enablers to develop agility? How can one effectively assist in enhancing agility? For an enterprise to achieve agility, it is critical to create an effective integrated procedure within the business that coordinates and ensures that the agility providers can satisfy the agility capabilities and cope with drivers, ultimately transforming all of these attributes into strategic competitive edges. However, the existing literature on enterprise agility has failed to sufficiently address the relevant perspectives in such analyzes. The relationship matrix in the quality function deployment (QFD) method provides an excellent tool for deploying important concepts and linking processes. This report suggests a new agility development method for dealing with the interface and alignment issues among the agility drivers, capabilities and providers using the QFD relationship matrix and fuzzy logic. A fuzzy agility index (FAI) for an enterprise composed of agility capability ratings and a total relation-weight with agility drivers was developed to measure the agility level of an enterprise. This report also describes how this robust approach has been applied to develop agility in a Taiwanese information technology (IT) product and service enterprise. This development project revealed that the proposed framework and procedures can enhance the agility of an enterprise as well as ensure a competitive edge.}

One fundamental questions in port performance studies is how to evaluate and quantify intangible indicators on performance. There are definitely inputs and outputs, which may be measured and evaluated through conventional instruments. However, each instrument deals with a particular aspect of whole performance problem (e.g. port efficiency, port productivity,), and many of these instruments are limited to ‘measurable’ data on port management and operations. In this paper, these two common problems are put under the scope, and a comprehensive port performance assessment scheme is established by gathering various perspectives. Quality function deployment (QFD) approach is preferred to formulize the problem and define priority ratings of expectations by each stakeholder in the port domain. The framework can contribute to a broader understanding of ports as business units, its development drivers and interaction with community neighbors, and to shed light to port performance assessment considering both public and private entities.}

abstract = {The digital content industry is flourishing as a result of the rapid development of technology and the widespread use of computer networks. As has been reported, the market size of the global e-learning (i.e., distance education and telelearning) will reach USD 49.6 billion in 2014. However, to retain and/or increase the market share associated with e-learning, it is important to maintain or increase service quality in this sector. This research was intended to develop an analytical model for enhancing the service quality of e-learning using a hybrid approach from the perspective of customers. The evaluation methodology integrates the three methods: rough set theory (RST), quality function deployment (QFD), and grey relational analysis (GRA). First, important criteria affecting service quality (referred to as customer requirements (CRs)) and relevant technical information (referred to as technical requirements (TRs)) for e-learning are compiled from an extensive literature review. Using the data regarding customer satisfaction collected from a questionnaire survey, RST is then used to reduce the number of attributes considered and to determine the CRs. Furthermore, in consultation with domain experts, QFD is used together with GRA to analyze the interrelationships between CRs (which represent the voice of customer (VOC)) and TRs (which represent the voice of the engineer (VOE)) and to create an order of priority for the TRs given the CRs based on objective weighting using the entropy value. An illustrative example is provided—an empirical analysis of the students who participated in the e-learning program at a particular university. The results reveal that of the fourteen TRs, “Curriculum development” has the greatest effect on e-learning service quality, followed by “Evaluation”, “Guidance and tracing”, “Instructional design”, and “Teaching materials”. Both the CRs and the TRs may vary depending on the individual organization. Nevertheless, the proposed model can be a useful point of reference for e-learning service providers, helping them to identify the TRs that they can use to enhance service quality and to target vital CRs.}

First, this paper determines 20 evaluation criteria from the four dimensions of platform overview, core technology, application support, and operations management. On this basis, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based on customer needs is proposed, which consists of three main steps. First, quality function deployment (QFD) and the best and worst method (BWM) are used to evaluate the four dimensions of the BTAP and specific evaluation criteria from the perspective of customers to obtain the criteria weight. Then, this method uses the extended Vlse Kriterjumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) approach to sort the alternatives. Finally, the improved decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to analyse the relationships between the 20 criteria in the four dimensions. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method are verified by an example. According to the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, the results show that this method can evaluate blockchain anti-counterfeiting enterprises. The main conclusions are as follows: the core technology is the most important factor influencing the choice of a BTAP project, and the role of application support in evaluation cannot be ignored.}

abstract = {In this work, we compare two product design approaches, quality function deployment (QFD) and conjoint analysis, by applying each to the design of a new all-purpose climbing harness for the beginning/intermediate ability climber that would complement a leading manufacturer’s existing product line. While many of the optimal design features were the same under both approaches, the differences allow us to highlight the strengths of each approach. With conjoint analysis, it was easier to compare the most preferred features (i.e., ones that maximized sales) to profit maximizing features and also to develop designs that optimize product line sales or profits. On the other hand, QFD was able to highlight the fact that certain engineering characteristics or design features had both positive and negative aspects. This tradeoff could point the way to “out of the box” solutions. QFD also highlighted the importance of starting explicitly with customer needs, regardless of which method is used. Rather than competing, we view them as complementary approaches that should be conducted simultaneously; each providing feedback to the other. When the two approaches differed on the optimal level or importance of a feature, it appeared that conjoint analysis better captured customers’ current preferences for product features while QFD captured what product developers thought would best satisfy customer needs. Looking at the problem through these different lenses provides a useful dialogue that should not be missed. QFD’s ability to generate creative or novel solutions should be combined with conjoint analysis’ ability to forecast market reaction to design changes.}

Taking into account the financial factors and uncertainties in the product design process, this paper deals with a fuzzy formulation combined with a genetic-based interactive approach to QFD planning. By introducing new concepts of planned degree, actual achieved degree, actual primary costs required and actual planned costs, two types of fuzzy optimisation models are discussed in this paper. These models consider not only the overall customer satisfaction, but also the enterprise satisfaction with the costs committed to the product. With the interactive approach, the best balance between enterprise satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction can be obtained, and the preferred solutions under different business criteria can be achieved through human–computer interaction. Scope and Purpose Quality function deployment (QFD) that originated in Japan in the late 1960s is a concept and mechanism for translating the ‘voice of customer’ into product through various stages of product planning, engineering and manufacturing. It has become a widely used customer-oriented approach to facilitating product design by analysing customer requirements (CRs). Determination of the target levels for the technical attributes (TAs) of a product with a view to achieving a high level of overall customer satisfaction is an important activity in product design and development. Traditional methods for QFD planning are mainly subjective, ad hoc and heuristic. They can hardly achieve global optimisation, and most of these models barely take into consideration the correlation between TAs. Moreover, most of these methods are technically one-sided without considering the design budget. However, the financial factor is also an important factor and should not be neglected in QFD planning. In addition, owing to uncertainties involved in the decision process, these deterministic methods could not formulate and solve it effectively. Taking into consideration the financial factors and uncertainties in the product design process, this paper deals with fuzzy formulation combined with a genetic-based interactive approach to QFD planning. By introducing new concepts of planned degree, actual achieved degree, actual primary costs required and actual planned costs, two types of fuzzy optimisation models are discussed in this paper. These models consider not only the overall customer satisfaction, but also the enterprise satisfaction with the costs committed to the product.

In order for robot manipulators to achieve trajectory tracking control, the end-effectors must move precisely along the given trajectories. The nonlinearity, strong coupling, and uncertainty of the system make trajectory tracking very complicated and difficult. An approach for robust feedback control is presented in this paper as a solution to this problem. The design relies on active disturbance rejection control to estimate unknown disturbances affecting the plant. The controlled system is an uncertain two-link manipulator with elastic gear transmissions, described by nonlinear friction and elasticity. It is based on an industrial benchmark problem. The model has two significant uncertainties: parametric uncertainty as well as external disturbances that affect tools and motors. A simulation-based evaluation of the proposed control method and a comparison of its performance, considering specific robustness requirements and trajectory tracking, are presented. The comparison includes the baseline controller, the QFD (Quality Function Deployment) method, and PD-CNN (PD Control Compensation based on the Cascade Neural Network). Computer simulations of the proposed controller are carried out to validate the ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) industrial benchmark. The simulation results demonstrate superiority in meeting stability and target value requirements. The stability and ultimate boundedness of the tracking error of ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control) are demonstrated.}

The QFD framework is employed to allocate resources and to coordinate skills and functions based on customer needs. Differing from earlier QFD applications, the proposed methodology employs fuzzy regression to determine the parameters of functional relationships between customer needs and e-learning product characteristics, and among e-learning product characteristics themselves. Finally, the e-learning product alternatives are evaluated and ranked with respect to deviations from the target product characteristic values.

A three-domain PSS conceptual design framework based on quality function deployment (QFD) is proposed in this research. QFD is a widely used design tool considering customer requirements (CRs). Since both product and services influence satisfaction of customer, they should be designed simultaneously. Identification of the critical parameters in these domains plays an important role. Engineering characteristics (ECs) in the functional domain include product-related ECs (P-ECs) and service-related ECs (S-ECs). ECs are identified by translating customer requirements (CRs) in the customer domain. Rating ECs’ importance has a great impact on achieving an optimal PSS planning. The rating problem should consider not only the requirements of customer, but also the requirements of manufacturer. From the requirements of customer, the analytic network process (ANP) approach is integrated in QFD to determine the initial importance weights of ECs considering the complex dependency relationships between and within CRs, P-ECs and S-ECs. In order to deal with the vagueness, uncertainty and diversity in decision-making, the fuzzy set theory and group decision-making technique are used in the super-matrix approach of ANP. From the requirements of manufacturer, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is applied to adjust the initial weights of ECs taking into account business competition and implementation difficulty.

A fuzzy approach has been adopted for calculation of the relative importance of different aesthetic attributes. The proposed method has been illustrated using customer survey data. Four out of 12 aesthetic attributes (i.e., elegant, family-feeling, modern, and youthful) were found to be attractive (more significant).

The proposed design process brought relevant improvements in four main aspects: 1) facilitated the communication among members of the multidisciplinary design team (engineers, occupational therapists, end users); 2) provided a clearer identification of the design demands as well as the users’ needs, incorporating them into the process; 3) promoted a reduction in development time as a whole; 4) allowed the generation of feasible and inventive solutions, with functionality and innovation. Preliminary tests with the functional prototype have been conducted with a 60-year-old male with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication use and the single-case experimental design has been applied to evaluate the impact on the quality of the feeding task in terms of performance and satisfaction.}

abstract = {Quality Function Deployment is a tool for bringing the voice of the customer into the product development process from conceptual design through to manufacturing. It begins with a matrix that links customer desires to product engineering requirements, along with competitive benchmarking information, and further matrices can be used to ultimately link this to design of the manufacturing system. Unlike other methods originally developed in the U.S. and transferred to Japan, the QFD methodology was born out of Total Quality Control (TQC) activities in Japan during the 1960s and has been transferred to companies in the U.S. This article reports on the results of a 1995 survey of more than 400 companies in the U.S. and Japan using QFD. The research questions investigated in this study were developed both inductively from QFD case studies in the U.S. and Japan and deductively from the literature. The reported results are in part counterintuitive. The U.S. companies reported a higher degree of usage, management support, cross-functional involvement, use of QFD driven data sources, and perceived benefits from using QFD. For the most part, the main uses of QFD in the U.S. were restricted to the first matrix (“House of Quality”) that links customer requirements to product engineering requirements and rarely was this carried forward to later matrices. U.S. companies were more apt to use newly collected customer data sources (e.g., focus groups) and methods for analyzing customer requirements. Japanese companies reported using existing product data (e.g., warranty) and a broader set of matrices to a greater extent. The use of analytical techniques in conjunction with QFD (e.g., simulation, design of experiments, regression, mathematical target setting, and analytic hierarchy process) was not wide spread in either country. U.S. companies were more likely to report benefits of QFD in improving cross-functional integration and better decision-making processes compared to Japanese companies. Possible reasons for these cross-national differences as well as their implications are discussed.}

This paper proposes a novel dynamic network data envelopment analysis framework as a comprehensive performance management system to dynamically assess a supply chain’s performance from both sustainability and resilience viewpoints over the course of time. The proposed model is also associated with a hybrid method using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) together with Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to systematically select the best sustainability and resilience factors, which are then used in the data envelopment analysis model.

abstract = {Because of the huge potential profit, the development of virtual items in massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) has lately begun receiving attention. As a successful means for developing new products, the quality function deployment (QFD) has been widely used in devising virtual items. In traditional QFD, information about the customers’ needs and their priorities can be gained through some marketing methods. However, these approaches heavily rely on the subjective results and cannot identify the demands of each customer because of bewildering amount of information. Thus, we adopt the genetic chaotic neural network (GCNN) technique to identify each customer’s needs and their priorities and propose the enhanced qualify function deployment (EQFD). However, in most of the existing literature, the equations to describe chaos dynamics are fixed and rigid corresponding to different nonlinear dynamic systems. In fact, for many chaotic systems in applications, it is often difficult to obtain accurate and faithful mathematical models, regarding their physically complex structures and hidden parameters. Therefore, GCNN is proposed in this paper, where GA is embedded into the chaotic neural network to generate and refine the equations of chaotic systems. By experimenting our methods with several benchmark methods, the proposed GCNN is found to demonstrate a clear advantage over other identifying methods, and EQFD is proven to be a feasible technique for developing the virtual items in MMORPGs.}

This decision is often influenced by the concerned stakeholders, suppliers, plant operators and customers in different tiers. As firms continue to seek competitive advantage through supply chain design and operations they aim to create optimized supply chains. This calls for on one hand consideration of multiple conflicting criteria and on the other hand consideration of uncertainties of demand and supply. Although there are studies on supplier selection using advanced mathematical models to cover a stochastic approach, multiple criteria decision making techniques and multiple stakeholder requirements separately, according to authors׳ knowledge there is no work that integrates these three aspects in a common framework. This paper proposes an integrated method for dealing with such problems using a combined Analytic Hierarchy Process–Quality Function Deployment (AHP–QFD) and chance constrained optimization algorithm approach that selects appropriate suppliers and allocates orders optimally between them. The effectiveness of the proposed decision support system has been demonstrated through application and validation in the bioenergy industry.}

Therefore, selecting the best MHE with the desirable characteristics from a vast array of available alternatives is one of the most onerous tasks as often being faced by the construction engineers. In this paper, a software prototype based on quality function deployment (QFD) technique is designed and developed in Visual BASIC 6.0 for selecting two most suitable bulk-type MHEs, i.e. excavator and wheel loader for specific applications at a construction site. It is integrated with QFD method to provide due importance to the spoken and unspoken needs of the customers/construction engineers. It automates the entire MHE selection process and also performs sensitivity analysis study to investigate the effect of changing criterion weight on the alternative MHEs' ranking pattern. Its potentiality and applicability in solving bulk-type MHE selection problems is demonstrated in detail.}

A possible solution lies in designing environmentally benign product/service systems (PSSs), which often requires the redesign of existing offerings in industrial practice. This article presents a design navigator named lifecycle-oriented function deployment (LFD), which builds on the widely utilized life cycle assessment (LCA) and quality function deployment (QFD) to support the redesign of existing industrial offerings towards PSSs with reduced environmental impacts. LFD includes a novel procedure to derive environmental requirements using LCA and to prioritize them along with customer requirements. It introduces a list of generic service design characteristics to support service design. It also contains a QFD-based procedure to identify design parameters (characteristics and components for both products and services) that have a relatively strong influence on the prioritized requirements. Further, a novel way is proposed to capture specific product and service design characteristics that are feasible to integrate and potentially have a rather strong influence on the requirements when combined. LFD is subsequently applied in a case study to conceptually redesign an existing offering in a manufacturing company. The application is then assessed using an LCA and a semi-structured interview with the users of LFD. The LCA results indicate significant reductions in environmental impacts of the redesigned concepts, and the interview revealed benefits for the practitioners who used LFD.}

Results show that students value traditional elements of nursing education – clinical practice and lectures – more highly than recent additions such as computer-aided instruction and multimedia teaching. Results also show that students are looking for quality primarily in the area of faculty characteristics. The implication is that institutions which provide nursing education should not neglect the importance of investing in faculty when they are seeking to upgrade the quality of their programs. Further QFD studies are recommended to evaluate the quality of nursing education from the perspective of preceptors and nurses who help to train students in clinical settings.}

It should be noticed too, while the new requirements have a major effect on the product successfully, the traditional requirement should not be forgotten by designers. Unfortunately, new issues sometimes are deeply coupled with traditional functions, so the current design methodologies are not able to consider them in the product design process. In this regard, the development of new design methods and tools that facilitate design process by consideration new requirements is vital. The Axiomatic Design (AD) approach is one of the most promising design methodology in the field of conceptual design. This method is emerging as a superior method of design, particularly when innovation versus incremental design is needed.

It was reported that more than three-million manholes in the United States (US) were structurally weak and prone to collapse. To avoid sudden failure, systematic manhole condition assessment model is required. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to develop a component-based condition assessment model for sewer access holes. The methodology was based on integrating the Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Decision-Making Trial Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques to study the causality relationship between the defects in the nine identified components of the manhole. The relative importance weights of the components were found by deploying the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and were used to compute the overall condition of the asset. Based on the results, the roots were the highest influence power in many of the components. In addition, the wall, cone, cover and frame, and seals components were higher importance weights compared to the remaining components. This model was tested on an actual case study from the city of Edmonton in Canada and compared with actual values. The model produced an average validity percentage (AVP) of 76.24%. The developed model is expected to enhance the assessment of manholes and therefore provide robust conclusions. Besides, the model offers a backward analysis to pinpoint critical components in the manhole. Consequently, better decisions are made pertinent to maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement interventions.}

The study area is located in the southwest Kaeng Khoi district and the east Muang District, Saraburi Province, Thailand. Based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics, the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer (Qfd) and a volcanic aquifer (Vc).
Study focus
This research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality.
New hydrological insights for the region
The groundwater type in Qfd and Vc is mainly Ca-Na-HCO3, suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources. This study found evidence of ion exchange between Ca2+ and Na+ in both seasons. The five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76.11 and 77.88 % in the rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Based on correlation analysis and PCA, the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations, including alkali feldspar and Ca2+- and Mg2+- rich minerals. Moreover, some ions arose from anthropogenic activities, typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater. The presence of photphate (PO43-) may be related to the dissolution of apatite and associated with anthropogenic activities, causing an increase in PO43− in the rainy season.}

The main function of PLM is to develop an attractive system which ensures customer satisfaction. Therefore, one of the important topics of the PLM system developments is to take customer requirements into consideration. Quality function deployment (QFD) has been widely used for numerous years; it is one of the structured methodologies that are used to translate customer needs into specific quality development. However, in the traditional QFD approach, each element’s interdependence and customer requirements are usually not systematically treated. Additionally, the Kano model can effectively classify customer demand attributes, but to make Kano model more objective in the course of weighing, we have also included Fuzzy mode in our discussion. This study presents an integrative approach by incorporating the Kano model with Fuzzy mode into the matrix of QFD and adjusting customer requirement weights. This approach can fulfill two objectives, First, through the Kano model with the Fuzzy mode, it will not only discriminate out options for the required attributes in much more breadth but also simultaneously render the discretions on the linguistic implications much more accurate with the aid of the ambiguous questionnaire response method. Second, combining the Kano model and QFD, can not only provide a new way to optimize the product design but can also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, and minimize dissatisfaction. The proposed methods can be useful to both practitioners and researchers. To illustrate our findings, we have incorporated an example which suggests that the proposed approach can contribute to the creation of attractive PLM attributes and PLM innovation.}

In this work, a systematic and semi-quantitative decision support framework for risk management of hazmats road transportation based on the combination of quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP), fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (F-FMEA), and nonlinear goal programming is proposed. The QFD is used innovatively to construct the overall framework, which contains three main components of general risk management: risk identification, risk assessment, and risk control. The F-AHP is used to build a hierarchical risk assessment system and determine the importance rating of each risk factor. The F-FMEA is used to evaluate the potential risks of risk control measures and determine the risk adjustment coefficient of each risk measure, which is used subsequently to modify the fulfillment level of risk measure in the nonlinear goal programming model. To address the inherent vagueness and uncertainty contained in the risk management process, the fuzzy set theory is introduced as an effective tool. An empirical case on risk management of a hazmats transportation company is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methodology. Some managerial implications on risk management of hazmats road transportation are provided based on the obtained findings.}

abstract = {Research on service quality and customer satisfaction has become significant in the hospitality industry. Nonetheless, most previously proposed or introduced research paradigms have focused exclusively on customers without equally emphasizing the intra-organizational service generation and delivery processes. In contrast, this study considers both external and internal service management issues and subsequent service innovations based on the framework of Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD and its relationship to similar concepts are explained. Next, this study provides an overview of the QFD process and develops a hypothetical application in the lodging industry in order to illustrate future application and analysis strategies. Some benefits and disadvantages of the QFD process are discussed as compared to extant service quality and customer satisfaction paradigms. Finally, suggestions and directions are offered for future applications, with particular interest in hospitality-specific service management issues.}

An integrated model and the approach procedures consists of four steps. In step 1, identification of CSNs is based on a data source triangulation approach, questionnaire survey, 5-point liner numeric rating scale, factor analysis, and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha statistic are utilized to guarantee that the CSNs are complete and reliable. In step 2, a correlation matrix is built to identify the critical ergonomic design areas and the key problems are established by analysis of the negative relationships obtained from interrelationship half-matrix at the roof of the HoQ. In step 3, to solve the problems, TRIZ main tools and contradiction analysis are utilized. Several innovative alternatives are generated by combining appropriate Inventive Principles of TRIZ, the critical ergonomic design areas and the ergonomic design principles. In step 4, a general and easy fuzzy group decision-making method for evaluating of the best design alternatives is presented. A case study of the integrated kitchen stove innovative design and evaluation is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.}

The main difficulties of these methodologies are the transformation of customers’ needs in technical requirements, the subjectivity of the evaluation and the strong relation between requirements and the adopted technological solutions. The most structured methodologies use QFD (quality function development); sometimes in combination with other design theories. An easier and faster way is based on the evaluation of each product requirement by importance and satisfaction values. In this article, a methodology called “KOMpetitive Intelligence” is proposed to make the evaluation of importance and satisfaction a more robust and consistent process. First, knowledge of experts is integrated with knowledge extracted from patents, market analysis, scientific literature and commercial literature. Second, the generation of new alternative solutions, coming from problem solving activities, are integrated in the evaluation process. Third, decision making and the definition of an innovation strategy are supported with a concise diagram that summarizes the gathered knowledge and facilitates the assessment of each requirement. After several academic case studies, this methodology has been applied in a big multinational firm for two different products and is now on-going for the development of a third product.}

Generally, typical BI users consist of financial analysts, marketing planners, and general managers. However, most of them are not familiar with BI’s core technologies. In order to help corporate executives better assess BI vendors, evaluation criteria are separated into marketing requirements (MRs) and technical attributes (TAs), respectively. In particular, a fuzzy MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) based QFD (quality function deployment) is proposed as follows: (1) fuzzy Delphi is used to aggregate the performance scores of BI vendors, (2) fuzzy DEMATEL (decision making and trial laboratory) is conducted to recognize the causalities between MRs and TAs, and (3) fuzzy AHP (analytical hierarchy process) is employed to recommend optimal BI systems. For better benchmarking, the strengths and weaknesses of three competitive BI vendors (i.e. SAP, SAS, and Microsoft) are concurrently visualized through displaying a line diagram (in terms of TAs) and a radar diagram (in terms of MRs). More importantly, experimental results demonstrate that supplier assessment and supplier recommendation have been successfully accomplished.}

These networks may be owned by the manufacturer or they can be outsourced to third parties. Most manufacturers prefer outsourcing, so this study proposes a benchmarked recovery process for third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP) by evaluating design criteria, implementation criteria, process control characteristics, and business orientation policies. Expertise efficiency of third party providers dictates their competitiveness and/or survival. In an effort to help third parties enhance value recovery from the process in the market, this paper seeks to establish a meaningful benchmark that will dictate best practices through quality function deployment (QFD). In particular, the paper offers a theoretical background to measure the relative importance among the various types of criteria. The proposed technique also helps to establish guidelines by which to prioritize the various characteristics. This study finds that the main driving factor regarding waste management centers on mandatory laws. It also concludes that when government relaxes its policies, environmentally oriented businesses are able to strengthen their systems.}

Determining the aggregated priority ratings (PRs) of engineering characteristics (ECs) is a crucial step of constructing PPHOQ. A QFD team often involves a group of cross-functional team member from marketing, design, quality, plan, finance, logistics, and after service. Each member of the QFD team from different backgrounds often demonstrates significantly different behavior from the others and generates different preference assessment to the competitive products. The gross benefit of implementing the improvement goal of the performance value (IGPV) of each EC should be estimated from the short- and long-term perspectives in a comprehensive and accurate way. In this paper, we propose an extended PPHOQ by using a least deviation based approach (LDBA), and balanced scorecard (BSC), and develop a comprehensive and systematic approach to determine the aggregated PRs of ECs in the extended PPHOQ. The proposed approach is based on the presented LDBA for dealing with competition and preference information to determine the technical point of each EC, and the combination of BSC and analytic hierarchy process for estimating the gross benefit of implementing the IGPV of each EC.

A customer survey and an expert opinion survey were conducted for US customers. The top five customer requirements for bulgogi were identified as taste, freshness, flavor, tenderness, and juiciness; ease of purchase was included in the place of tenderness after calculating the weight requirements. Eighteen engineering characteristics were developed, and a ‘localization of bulgogi menu’ is strongly related to the other characteristics as well. The results from the calculation of relative importance of engineering characteristics identified that the ‘control of marinating time’, ‘localization of bulgogi menu’, ‘improvement of cooking and serving process’, ‘development of recipe by parts of beef’, and ‘use of various seasonings’ were the highest contributors to the overall improvement of bulgogi. The relative importance of engineering characteristics, correlation, and technical difficulties are ranked and integrated to develop the most effective strategy. The findings are discussed relative to industry implications.}

The House of Quality (HoQ) in QFD methodology is a systematic tool to consider the inter-relationships between two factors. In this paper, three HoQs are used to consider the interrelationships between tasks and hazards, hazards and events, and events and preventive/protective measures. The final priority weights of events are defined by considering their project-specific preliminary weights, probability of occurrence, and effects on the victim and the company. The priority weights of the preventive/protective measures obtained in the last HoQ are fed into a 0–1 knapsack model for the investment decision. Then, the selected preventive/protective measures can be adapted to the task design. The proposed step-by-step methodology can be applied to any stage of a project to design the workplace for occupational safety and health, and continuous improvement for safety is endorsed by the closed loop characteristic of the integrated methodology.}

The purpose of this study is to review EE practices and applications in residential buildings in order to raise awareness on smart energy consumption. In the preliminary stage of this study, consumers estimate their monthly energy consumption of their electrical appliances by using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach. QFD approach focuses on consumers’ opinion of electrical appliances good and beneficial functions. Selection of residence was made between medium and affordable cost residential areas in Johor. Databases for energy relating to electrical appliances were developed based on the data obtained from the relevant ministry and agencies such as KeTTHA, Energy Commission and TNB. Energy Efficiency Estimation System (EEES) is being developed to help consumers estimate the amount of energy being used daily, which will help consumers to use energy more efficiently. EE indirectly helps reduce the effect on environment especially the greenhouse gases. The promotion of EE and independence from the non-renewable energy source is important in ensuring a sustainable development.}

The House of Quality (HOQ) is the first matrix produced when QFD is applied. Although several adaptations to the HOQ have been made to make the method user-friendly for the food industry, very few industry applications can be found in the literature. This paper presents the possibilities and limitations of the HOQ for the improvement of food products based on consumer preferences, processing parameters and sensory attributes. The method is illustrated by a case-study for filled chocolates. Although the results of the case-study provide insights concerning product improvement of filled chocolates, it also reveals limitations for the application and interpretation of HOQ within the food industry. To tackle these problems, the authors propose to include fuzzy set theory when completing the planning matrix, to incorporate chain information in the HOQ, and to establish good communication between departments. With precise and appropriate application of the HOQ, it is possible for a company to produce products with high consumer preference and, thus, a high success rate.}

This aspect is becoming a key factor in the industrial competitiveness for the presence of extended enterprises that normally deal with huge data exchange and share processes. This scenario is due to the presence of partners geographically distributed over the entire globe, that participate in different steps of the product lifecycle (product development, maintenance and recycling). At present, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) seems to be the appropriate solution to support enterprises in this complex scenario, even though a real standardized approach for the implementation of knowledge sharing and management tools does not exist today. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to develop a knowledge management operative methodology able to support the formalization and the reuse of the enterprise expertise acquired while working on previous products. By focusing on consumer packaged goods enterprises and on the concept development phase (which is one of the most knowledge intensive phases of the whole product lifecycle), this research work has developed a new systematic methodology to support knowledge codification and knowledge management operations.

abstract = {Due to ever-increasing technological acceleration leading to rapid changes in society and its needs, just as today's habits and needs turn out to be completely different from those of only a few years ago, likewise it is reasonable to assume that the same trend will continue in its growth path, making today's solutions rapidly obsolete as time passes and technological innovations follow. This study aims to investigate possible solutions in search of a futuristic and breakthrough response to what is present today. The idea concerns the design of a new type of means of transportation that can best interface with what today are the various criticalities given by vehicular traffic mainly urban but also suburban, going to solve by generating new opportunities from previous problems. This system will be able to go alongside and gradually replace a substantial portion of the current means of transport going to conceptually redefine some elements taken for granted today. In this regard, the application of the IDeS (Industrial Design Structure) methodology has been found to be of great use, which, thanks to the scientific and repeatable methods contained within, has made it possible to arrive at a very clear visualization of the problem, a precise definition, and a level of innovation that is fully satisfactory with respect to the contemporary scenario, while always keeping an eye on feasibility while taking into account the conceptual and therefore deliberately very driven nature of the solution being designed.}

abstract = {Today, new services creation is very crucial for RFID (radio frequency identification) products manufacturers. A newly successful RFID application can enhance their change in organization and to manage growth in an increasingly competitive environment. But, there is a high failure rate in new products development processes. Thus, RFID manufacturers need an effective tool to assist them to create novel RFID product functions. This study proposes a newly systematic approach called QT-Kano model which integrates three management tools, quality function deployment (QFD), the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), and a refined Kano’s model, to create new product functions of RFID products. In QT-Kano model, QFD has firstly been used to transform customer demands into engineering quality characteristics. Secondly, based on the contradiction relationship between those engineering quality characteristics, the novel designed functions are created by TRIZ. Finally, to reduce the high failure rate in new products development processes, a refined Kano’s model are applied to offer a better understanding from customer’s viewpoint and to assist service designers focusing on the most important attributes that need to be improved. A real case of RFID product function development is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

Design requirements (DRs) and part characteristics are important decision making problems during QFD activity processes for new product development. Here a Fuzzy decision-making system (FDMS) considering customer needs (CNs) as factors is proposed to formulate the problem. The structure of the FDMS is based on fuzzy control rules. Thus, CNs are determined as input variables and fuzzified using membership function concept. Weights of these factors are then fuzzified to ensure the consistency of the decision maker when assigning the importance of each factor over another. By applying IF–THEN decision rules, DRs of the firm are scored. This paper also uses Fuzzy analytic-network process (FANP) to determine the fulfillment levels of DRs of the firm. The comparison of FDMS with Fuzzy analytical network process (FAHP) is also presented.}

However, none of the studies focus on the selection and weighting of the metrics as a group decision process and in a way that considers the degree of difficulty of collecting data for measuring performance on a particular metric. Therefore, this paper proposes a group decision model for selecting metrics for supply chain sustainability management. The proposal is based on the combination of Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) with the prioritization procedure of the house of quality of the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method. HFLTS are used to represent judgments of different decision makers about the importance of supply chain sustainable performance requirements and the relationship between selected metrics and requirements. Prioritization of requirements and metrics is based on the method of distance measures between HFLTSs. The degree of difficulty of data collection is also estimated based on judgments using linguistic expressions and on distance measures of HFLTSs. An illustrative application is presented based on a first tier automobile manufacturing company. Through this illustrative example it is possible to see the benefit of using hesitant fuzzy sets to aggregate the judgments of different decision makers. It is also evident the importance of considering the degree of difficulty of data collecting as an additional argument to select and prioritize metrics. The proposed decision model can also be applied to other decision problems such as selecting criteria for sustainable supplier selection and evaluation.}

Firstly, to deal with the vagueness or impreciseness of the voice of customer (VOC), the fuzzy quality function deployment (fuzzy-QFD) using fuzzy weighted average method in the fuzzy expected value operator is introduced into hypoid gear manufacturing. It can convert them into the critical to qualities (CTQs), and the technical geometric and physical performance requirements. And then, the multi-objective optimization (MOO) modification of machine settings is proposed to establish a basic data-driven model for collaborative system. Different with the conventional modification only considering geometric performance, it provides an improved modification also considering the physical performances. Finally, a double-curved shell model of hypoid gear finite element is used to perform the numerical loaded tooth contact analysis (NLTCA), as well as to establish the data-driven relationships between machine settings and physical performance evaluations. Immediately, whole development is divided into three sub-problems: i) optimal operations of the noise factors by measurement and numerical control (NC) compensation, ii) identification of the prescribed ease-off topography by multi-objective optimization using iterative reference point approach and iii) modification considering geometric performance by a trust region algorithm with step strategy. The numerical instance in practical applications is given to verify the proposed methodology.}

These activities urge governments and companies alike to set up environmental friendly production technologies, which aim to avoid harmful emissions into air, water and soil. However, these Eco-designed products have not been achieved a favorable position in the marketplace as expected even though they appear to be more environmental friendly and economical. This may be due that they are focused solely on environmental impact analysis without regard for customer needs and cost considerations. In this research, an Eco-quality function deployment (Eco-QFD) is developed to aid a product design team in considering environmental concerns since QFD is a proven quality systems tool to achieve total customer satisfaction. A fuzzy group method is applied to Eco-QFD for product development planning to reduce the vagueness and uncertainty in a group decision-making process. This fuzzy multi-objective model not only considers the overall customer satisfaction but also encourages enterprises to produce an environmentally friendly product. With an interactive approach, the optimal balance between environmental acceptability and overall customer satisfaction can be obtained. Finally, a case study illustrating the application of the proposed model is also provided.}

In the proposed methodology, a hierarchical framework for generating the refined set of EC candidates from the EC candidates obtained by brainstorming is established. A concept of a general relationship between a CR and an EC is introduced, and then a novel approach for identifying the general relationship measures with the help of intelligent characteristics of rough set is proposed. Another concept of the intension threshold of the general relationship corresponding to a CR is introduced, and then a set-operation-based method of acquiring ECs used in PPHOQ is presented. An example of a two-cylinder washing machine is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.}

The model was developed based on the needs of a group of 20 waste generator companies (WGCs) of the metal-mechanic sector in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, as a means to standardize the evaluation of their ESPs. The model uses the house of quality (HOQ) of the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool. This tool helps to systematize the identification and prioritization of the WGCs’ requirements as well as the indicators to evaluate and control the performance of the selected ESPs. Four macro-phases compose the developed model, which are divided into 12 steps and 31 activities. Following the QFD precepts, the 61 WGCs’ secondary requirements were organized into nine management areas of primary requirements. A set of 61 indicators complemented the top of the house of quality. In addition, two qualifying criteria were defined to identify ESPs with better performance. The criteria revealed that only five of the 13 ESPs evaluated had complied with both of them. The others complied with one criterion only, while two did not comply with either of the two criteria. Thus, the successive applications of the proposed model contribute to the development of ESPs as well as the improvement of the relationship between WGCs and ESPs. The results of the present study also indicate the potential for consolidation of shared accountability roles in environmental management relationships.}

SQFD integrates stochastic simulation modeling and analysis techniques into traditional QFD to deal efficiently with the uncertainties in the input data, to support the quality performance measurement that is involved in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and to predict the variability in the output. D/B construction owners who are in the process of selecting a D/B firm for a project would benefit from SQFD, because the system allows an owner to expeditiously assess the quality performance of potential D/B firms in their bidding list. An example in D/B contractor evaluation is presented to illustrate the functioning of the system. This quantitative method is a significant contribution to the field of quality performance measurement, because (1) SQFD is totally automated, (2) SQFD's reliability is higher than conventional QFD, and (3) SQFD efficiently deals with uncertainties in multi-attribute and multi-participant decision-making, and therefore generates more accurate results. The system helps to improve the D/B project bidding system.}

As a result, a proliferation of methods and solutions for project prioritization has been developed, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for prioritizing projects taking into consideration four pervasive challenges in decision making: 1) uncertainty (imprecision and vagueness) of human decisions, 2) reliability (extent of sureness) of decision makers, 3) systematic identification of selection criteria, and 4) robustness of decision making (reasonable tolerance against insignificant changes to decision makers' evaluations during the process). In doing so, we propose integrating Z-numbers theory with Quality Function Development (ZQFD), four Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (Z-MCDM) methods, ensemble ranking aggregation, and sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is then applied in a real-world organization with twenty IT projects to illustrate how our approach might be used in practice. Furthermore, we elaborate on the trustworthiness of the proposed method in light of 16 criteria available in the literature of structured decision making.}

This methodology can recognize the specific technologies with development potential in the eyewear industry, and identify holders of key relevant patents. This study finds that consumers value functions including motion tracking, reminders, eye state detection, and non-eye disease detection. Key technologies with development potential for satisfying customer demand include eyewear, communications protocols, and sensors. Thus, embedding micron-scale sensors directly into contact lenses to monitor user physiological data can satisfy customer demand and is considered as emerging technology in the smart eyewear industry. Furthermore, patent portfolios of these technologies vary among different countries and regions, with the US and EU focusing on eye tracking, motion tracking, and identity verification, while China focuses on eye fatigue detection, distance measurement, and wireless frequency technologies. Visualizations of overall research results can benefit eyewear-related patent holders, eyewear manufacturers and smart wearable manufacturers to build their patent portfolio strategies on the basis of regional or country considerations.}

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) has been used as the concurrent engineering tool to save the production cost and time. It is not easy to get information or knowledge for the prioritization of customer attributes and engineering characteristics during the QFD planning process. This research suggests a linear partial ordering approach for assessing the knowledge from participants and prioritizing engineering characteristics. The linear partial information will be used in extracting weights of customer attributes and relationship values of customer attributes between engineering characteristics. Using the linear partial ordering can reduce the cognitive burden of designers and engineers of QFD planning team. Four types of dominance relation that are frequently used in multi-attribute decision making with incomplete information are used to determine the priorities of engineering characteristics when the linear partial orderings of participants are given. The dominance relations between engineering characteristics can be established by solving a series of linear programming problem.}

The researchers propose the reconfiguration concepts with the main objective of optimizing press brake utilization as determined by the set up bed length, multiple parts bent per set up, bending force, stroke height, bending technology, set up and r ramp up time, and number of strokes. The procedure for RBPT concept development include the construction of a first house of quality (HOQ1) based on the quality function deployment (QFD) technique. Research done by the authors identified two main objectives of RBPT design which are geometric transformation and productivity adjustment. The first can be further split into two reconfiguration categories, horizontal reconfigurability and vertical reconfigurability. These are used to derive reconfiguration needs for the RBPTs. Identification of the RBPT modules is done using the function driven object oriented (FUDOO) methodology. This involves identification of the primary function of a typical RBPT and cascading it down to sub functions and terminal functions subsequently. Reconfiguration concepts are then developed for each identified RBPT module. Length reconfiguration is proposed to extend or shorten the bed and ram span. This will be accomplished by introducing standard modules for the bed and ram beams optimally designed to withstand deflection during bending.}

This research aims to identify and prioritize the factors that affect in-cabin passenger comfort on high-speed rail (HSR) based on empirical evidence collected from China. For the identification process, the quality-management tool known as quality function deployment (QFD) to capture the voice of the customer is used to discover the most important demands as the driving influencing factors of in-cabin passenger comfort, by utilizing passengers’ feedback regarding their experiences with HSR posted in social media. Such factors will be prioritized by a fuzzy linguistic group decision-making approach based on the adoption of generalized comparative linguistic expressions obtained from a questionnaire investigation on randomly selected HSR passengers, and accomplishing a decision-solving procedure that includes consistency-checking and consensus-reaching processes to achieve an effective, reliable, and agreed prioritization of the factors. The research outputs will suggest the factors of greatest concern among all HSR passenger demands.

The techniques that were employed in the study included: consumer surveys, quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), and Quality function deployment (QFD). A consumer survey of 400 Thai respondents showed a high proportion of consumers (25%) ate fruit leather once or more often/week. Thai consumers were also asked to evaluate seven representative fruit leather products using a 9-point hedonic scale for various sensory attributes as well as overall liking and their responses together with data that was obtained from a QDA panel was used in the QFD to define the importance of the various sensory characteristics for the design of a new fruit leather. Based on customer requirements, the most important of product technical specifications found from QFD were the sweetness and hardness. The important process parameters related to such technical specifications were glucose syrup for the sweetness and pectin for control of the product’s textural characteristics. A 32 factorial design was used to optimize the addition levels of glucose syrup and pectin in gold kiwifruit leather. A recipe with 15g glucose syrup and 2g pectin per 100g gold kiwifruit puree had the highest hedonic score.}

On the other hand, the design structure matrix (DSM), a popular representation and analysis technique, has led to its increasing use in a variety of contexts, including product development, project management and system engineering. In this paper, we develop a novel framework which integrates QFD and DSM to support product design planning, including product architecture/components deployment, design scheduling and costing. A knowledge-based database is developed to support the proposed framework. The details are presented and a prototype product design planning system is implemented with a practical application in the semiconductor industry, system-on-a-chip product design planning, to validate the completeness and benefits of the proposed approach.}

The weights of importance of market segments and development costs in the model are expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers in order to describe the imprecision caused by human subjective judgement.

A key concern of all innovation approaches is to translate the needs, wants and aspirations of users and customers into product and service solutions that match the underlying needs. Many existing innovation approaches focus predominantly on the translation process itself by providing support for aggregating data and making trade-off decisions between user preferences traceable. For that reason, we label these approaches user preference-driven. In contrast, over the last two decades, design thinking (DT) has emerged as an approach that assumes knowledge of user needs information to be fuzzy and unreliable; it addresses this challenge by focusing on developing user experiences through empathic in-depth user research and iterative prototyping. Consequently, we label approaches such as DT user experience-driven. Although DT has generated particular interest among both practitioners and educators, the academic literature investigating the usefulness of DT remains scarce. To help close this gap, we study the performance implications of applying DT processes and tools in terms of new product concept creativity relative to applying a traditional innovation approach. Using an experimental design and collecting quantitative data from 53 teams and their projects, we find that teams applying DT outperform the control group that applies an alternative innovation approach, namely quality function deployment (QFD), in terms of the feasibility, relevance and specificity of concepts, but not the novelty. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.}

To take advantage of this, the unique way is to analyze customer's requirements systematically and to transform them into the appropriate product features properly. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a well-known planning methodology for translating customer needs (CNs) into relevant design requirements (DRs). The intent of applying QFD is to consolidate the customers’ preferences to the various phases of the product development cycle for a new product, or a new version of an existing product. However, it is more difficult to assess the performance of this process with accurate quantitative evaluation due to its uncertain nature. Moreover, people tend to give information about their personal preferences in many different ways, numerically or linguistically, depending on their background and value systems. In this study, a new fuzzy group decision-making approach is presented to fuse multiple preference styles to respond CNs in product development with QFD in a better way. The approach is illustrated with a numerical example concerning the development of the hatch door of a car.}

Albeit QFD aims to maximize customer satisfaction, requirements related to enterprise satisfaction such as cost budget, extendibility, and technical difficulty also need to be considered. This paper presents a fuzzy multiple objective decision framework that includes not only fulfillment of engineering characteristics to maximize customer satisfaction, but also maximization of extendibility and minimization of technical difficulty of engineering characteristics as objectives subject to a financial budget constraint to determine target levels of engineering characteristics in product design.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of outpatient services for elderly patients in Taiwan. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a tool effectively shortening the research-and-development period, reducing costs, and fulfilling customer needs (CNs). This study applied Kano's model and the analytic network process (ANP) to improve the basic framework of QFD. Kano's model enables a thorough understanding of elderly patients’ needs and problems with regard to medical care services, so that appropriate outpatient services can be offered to them from the outset. In addition, adapting the supermatrix of ANP to the calculation of the house of quality (HoQ) will reduce subjective judgments. Using Kano's model and an integrated ANP-QFD approach, we extracted five needs of elderly patients and calculated their priorities: ‘Professional medical care services convincing patients’ (27%), ‘With sufficient knowledge to answer patients’ questions’ (23.5%), ‘Providing fast services to solve patients’ problems’ (19.3%), ‘Voluntarily serving patients’ (19.1%), and ‘Providing proper medical equipment to patients’ (11.1%). We then identified six outpatient service attributes deserving of improvement and their priorities: ‘Physician with a high level of professionalism and giving clear interpretation of patient's condition’ (25%), ‘Staff with good communication skills and assistance to patients’ (22%), ‘High standardization of operating procedures’ (18%), ‘Staff getting on-the-job training periodically’ (15%), ‘Facilities sufficient and fitting for elderly patients’ (10%), and ‘Applying IT (internet) to help patients to receive medical care’ (10%). In conclusion, we reconstructed an integrated QFD model which will not only reduce costs but also reveal the crucial outpatient service items that will improve the quality of medical care for elderly people.}

In particular, we answer in the positive, in the more general latticial setting, some open questions on QFD modules raised by Albu and Rizvi [Comm. Algebra 29 (2001) 1909–1928]. Applications of these results are given to Grothendieck categories and module categories equipped with a torsion theory.}

abstract = {Quality function deployment (QFD) has been widely used to translate customer requirements to a product’s technical attributes. Correctly rating the importance of every customer requirement is essential to the QFD process because it will largely affect the final target value of a product’s technical attributes. This paper proposes a new customer requirements ranking method that considers competitors’ information. In today’s competitive environment, there are usually several products to fulfill certain functions. The success of a product depends not only on whether it meets the customer requirements, but also on how it compares with competitor products. Most previous methods focus only on the customer perspective, and ignore the competitive environment. The proposed method considers competition position, current performance and customers’ viewpoint to produce the ratings. In addition, this method uses fuzzy mathematics instead of crisp numbers to capture the true customer requirements. Compared with previous methods, this method is more meaningful and provides companies with a way to find the best product design strategy. A numerical example is shown to illustrate the approach.}

abstract = {The paper presents a study of the potential for applying the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method to the analysis of the framework for safety management contained in the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations (IRMER) of 2000. The QFD method has been successfully applied to many industrial and manufacturing processes in order to ensure that quality is built into products at the outset rather than tested for after their production. In this context, the term quality is used to describe the degree to which the needs and requirements of the customer are fulfilled. More frequently, now, the QFD approach is being applied to health care in order to engineer clinical processes that can best fulfil the needs of the patient. In the case of diagnostic radiology, safety management must not only be concerned with radiation protection but, more importantly, with the accuracy and consistency of any diagnostic outcome. Both are important patient needs. A first stage analysis of IRMER 2000 is presented that assesses how patients' needs are expressed by the individual IRMER components of justification, optimisation, clinical audit, expert advice, equipment and training. The analysis involved a QFD assessment by four radiation protection experts with over 100 man-years of experience. A second stage analysis assesses how the individual IRMER components have been engineered into a safety management framework through specific requirements embodied in IRMER 2000. The results of this assessment are discussed in terms of clinical, human, operational management and equipment related aspects of the radiological process. This study highlights how the QFD approach may be applied to engineer specific aspects of radiological practice that play a key role in ensuring that patients' needs are fully met. As an example, clinical audit requirements are analysed by means of the QFD method to indicate the design requirements of information and knowledge based systems that can provide the necessary information for this type of key management activity.}

The intent of applying QFD is to incorporate the voice of the customer into the various phases of the product development cycle for a new product, or a new version of an existing product. The traditional QFD structure requires individuals to express their preferences in a restricted scale without exceptions. In practice, people contributing to the process tend generally to give information about their personal preferences in many different ways, numerically or linguistically, depending on their background. Moreover, collaborative decision-making is not an emphasized issue in QFD even though it requires several people's involvement. In this study, we extend the QFD methodology by introducing a new group decision making approach that takes into account multiple preference formats and fusing different expressions into one uniform group decision by means of fuzzy set theory. An application on software development is supplied to illustrate the approach.}

However, the market shares of mobile phones have been intensively fluctuating because many brand companies like Nokia or Motorola have been merged. In order to brainstorm innovative ideas, this paper incorporates the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) into quality function deployment (QFD) to address the following issues: (1) a smartphone is characterized by marketing requirements (MRs) and technical attributes (TAs), (2) engineering conflicts among TAs are tackled by TRIZ, (3) user preferences for MRs are extracted to form a basis of market segmentation, (4) user perceptions of TAs are captured to identify significant features with regard to the ad-hoc segments. More importantly, numerous industrial examples including Sony’s QX series, Samsung’s K-zoom, Nokia’s Lumia 1020, Asus’s Zenfone zoom, Asus’s Padfone series, LG’s G flex, Samsung’s galaxy beam, and Lenovo’s Yoga Tablet 2 are illustrated to validate this research. In brief, this study does not only provide a way to handle engineering conflicts in designing smartphones but also help product planners generate innovative alternatives for acquiring the ad-hoc niche segments.}

While selecting the most suitable material for a specific application, the designers often need a sound and systematic methodology to deal with this problem having multiple candidate alternative choices and conflicting objectives. Most of the previously applied methodologies for material selection have either adopted criteria weights estimated using subjective judgments of the designers or failed to give due emphasis on the voice of the customers to meet their requirements. In this paper, a maiden venture is taken to solve the material selection problems using a quality function deployment (QFD)-based approach that can integrate the voice of the customers for a product with its technical requirements. The applicability and solution accuracy of this QFD-based material selection model is demonstrated with the help of four illustrative examples. To ease out the materials selection decision-making process, a user-friendly software prototype in Visual BASIC 6.0 is also developed.}

abstract = {The theory of quantum fluid dynamics (QFD) helps nanotechnology engineers to understand the physical effect of quantum forces. Although the governing equations of quantum fluid dynamics and classical fluid mechanics have the same form, there are two numerical simulation problems must be solved in QFD. The first is that the quantum potential term becomes singular and causes a divergence in the numerical simulation when the probability density is very small and close to zero. The second is that the unitarity in the time evolution of the quantum wave packet is significant. Accurate numerical evaluations are critical to the simulations of the flow fields that are generated by various quantum fluid systems. A finite volume scheme is developed herein to solve the quantum hydrodynamic equations of motion, which significantly improve the accuracy and stability of this method. The QFD equation is numerically implemented within the Eulerian method. A third-order modified Osher–Chakravarthy (MOC) upwind-centered finite volume scheme was constructed for conservation law to evaluate the convective terms, and a second-order central finite volume scheme was used to map the quantum potential field. An explicit Runge–Kutta method is used to perform the time integration to achieve fast convergence of the proposed scheme. In order to meet the numerical result can conform to the physical phenomenon and avoid numerical divergence happening due to extremely low probability density, the minimum value setting of probability density must exceed zero and smaller than certain value. The optimal value was found in the proposed numerical approach to maintain a converging numerical simulation when the minimum probability density is 10−5 to 10−12. The normalization of the wave packet remains close to unity through a long numerical simulation and the deviations from 1.0 is about 10−4. To check the QFD finite difference numerical computations, one- and two-dimensional particle motions were solved for an Eckart barrier and a downhill ramp barrier, respectively. The results were compared to the solution of the Schrödinger equation, using the same potentials, which was obtained using by a finite difference method. Finally, the new approach was applied to simulate a quantum nanojet system and offer more intact theory in quantum computational fluid dynamics.}

Two interrelated house of quality matrices are constructed, and fusion of fuzzy information and 2-tuple linguistic representation model are employed to compute the weights of supplier selection criteria and subsequently the ratings of suppliers. The proposed method is apt to manage non-homogeneous information in a decision setting with multiple information sources. The decision framework presented in this paper employs ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator, and the aggregation process is based on combining information by means of fuzzy sets on a basic linguistic term set.

However, when confronted by the range of e-CRM methods, manufacturing companies struggle to identify the one most appropriate to their needs. This paper presents a novel structured approach to evaluate and select the best agile e-CRM framework in a rapidly changing manufacturing environment. The e-CRM frameworks are evaluated with respect to their customer and financial oriented features to achieve manufacturing agility. Initially, the e-CRM frameworks are prioritized according to their financial oriented characteristics using a fuzzy group real options analysis (ROA) model. Next, the e-CRM frameworks are ranked according to their customer oriented characteristics using a hybrid fuzzy group permutation and a four-phase fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) model with respect to three main perspectives of agile manufacturing (i.e., strategic, operational and functional agilities). Finally, the best agile e-CRM framework is selected using a technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) model. We also present a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms.}

Furthermore, the customers tend to give their personal preferences in multiple expression formats, i.e., multiplicative judgment comparison matrix, utility value vector, and complementary judgment comparison matrix, relying on their cultural and educational background and value systems.

How the product is used is defined in a product manual. It is taken into account in the final phase of the techno-centric process, which leads not only to modifications of the late design phases, but also to difficulties using the product. Product manual also helps businesses save significant staff training and customer service costs. Anthropocentric methods are rarely used by the general public, and are in fact too expensive. We propose to take product use into account by integrating behavioral analyses (the behavior of the product and of its user) with functional analyses. This will allow us to set out instructions for using the product right at the design stage. An analysis of techno- and anthropocentric approaches is presented in this work in a bid to position our approach. Next, a functional and behavioral analysis is proposed based on a car seat case study. The proposed method also calls for a phase dedicated to the collection of product use information and data on user feedback or legislatives data. These analyses are carried out using the QFD method in order to assist the designer in structuring knowledge, taking into account the functions of the product, the characteristics or criteria of its use, and the points to be developed when drawing up operating instructions.}
