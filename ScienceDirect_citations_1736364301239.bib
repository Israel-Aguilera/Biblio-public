abstract = {Previous studies carried out customer surveys by questionnaires to collect data for analyzing consumer requirements. In recent years, a large and growing body of literature has investigated the extraction of customer requirements and preferences from online reviews. However, since customer requirements change dynamically over time, traditional studies failed to obtain the change data of customer requirements and opinions based on sentiments expressed in reviews. In this paper, a new method for dynamically mining user requirements is proposed, which is used to analyze the changing behavior of product attributes and improve product design. Dynamic mining differs from the traditional need acquisition mainly in three aspects: (1) it involves dynamically mining user requirements over time (2) it adds changes in manufacturers’ opinions to the analysis (3) it allows for product improvement strategies based on the changing behavior of product attributes. First, text mining is adopted to collect customer and manufacturer review data for different time periods and extract product attributes. A Natural Language Processing tool is used to measure the importance weight and sentiment score of product attributes. Second, an approach for dynamically mining user requirements is introduced to classify product attributes and analyze the changes of attribute data in three categories over time. Finally, an improvement strategy for next-generation product design is developed based on the changing behavior of attributes. Moreover, a case study on vehicles based on online reviews was conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology. Our research suggests that the proposed approach can accurately mine customer requirements and lead to successful product improvement strategies for next-generation products.}

We argue that it is more appropriate to investigate the direct impact of soft TQM on the diffusion of hard TQM, and then assess the direct impact of hard TQM on performance. Analysis of 261 Australian manufacturing companies revealed significant positive relationships between soft TQM and hard TQM elements. In addition to direct affects, soft TQM also has an indirect affect on performance through its effect on hard TQM.}

As a crucial SC decision, sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process have been addressed abundantly in the previous literature. However, this process has not yet been realized within Industry 4.0 SCs where interconnection, real-time information transparency, technical assistance and decentralization of members of a physical system (i.e., supply chain members) are regarded as the main design principles. To narrow the identified gap, a Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) approach is proposed for addressing sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process to provide a proper communication channel, structured information exchange and visibility among suppliers and manufacturers. Furthermore, the application of MASs in this process and their natural applicability as one of the enabling technologies in moving towards Industry 4.0 SCs are investigated in detail. It is found that the proposed approach can help decision-makers inside manufacturing firms to make prompt decisions with less human interactions. The merit of the developed MAS is demonstrated through a real-world implementation on a medical device manufacturer. Finally, the limitations and advantages of the proposed approach are presented together with some remarks for future work.}

We use a quasi-experimental approach exploiting the timing and county-specific implementation of Medicaid managed care mandates in two contiguous regions of Kentucky. We find large differences in the relative success of each plan in reducing utilization and spending that are likely driven by important differences in plan design. The plan that capitated primary care physicians and contracted out many administrative responsibilities to an experienced managed care organization achieved significant reductions in outpatient and professional utilization. The plan that opted for a fee-for-service reimbursement scheme with a group withhold and handled administration internally saw a much more modest reduction in outpatient utilization and an increase in professional utilization.}

This strategy is widely adopted by airlines. However, the selection of strategic alliance partner is a very decisive decision, and this selection process engrosses a number of complex processes which is result of compound reflection of associated various factors. In addition, the decision makers may be inconsistent in their views and preferences, arising due to imperfect information or intrinsic conflict between various departments. This paper presents a model based approach of an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for evaluation of criteria and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) for the selection of strategic alliance partner. A case of Indian airline industry demonstrates the application of the proposed approach. Eventually, robustness of the model is demonstrated by sensitivity analysis.}

Years of research has established it is vital to capture, analyze and prioritize requirements, which to a great extent relies on acknowledgment acceptance of stakeholder’s requirements, concerns and criteria’s. Proposed method provides interactive support for eliciting stakeholders and developer’s initial ranking decision in collaborative manner. Intuitionistic Fuzzy Approach (IFS) is used to support stakeholders view; whereas analysis of inter relationships, requirement slicing and backtracking are used to support developers view using weighted page rank algorithm. Finally a ranking is generated in a collaborative manner to support requirement prioritization. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated through an experimental proof of concept by comparing results of proposed approach with state of art, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) prioritization techniques. Results of experimentation conclude that presented approach is capable of producing accurate and comparable results by handling technical constraints of dependency, tradeoffs of collaboration and scope of inclusion of initial multi-criteria preferences expressed as priority values to support reliability and robustness to errors.}

Therefore, secure collaboration is of critical significance in the global design and supply chain management. This paper aims to collect and analyze systematically the existing scattered research of secure collaboration in global design and supply chain environment, and to give a comprehensive literature review to summarize the problems and the corresponding solutions. By applying the Environment-based Design (EBD) methodology, the existing methods and technologies are classified into four levels: infrastructure, information, agreement, and confidence. Four corresponding research problems are then formulated: information access control, information partitioning, legal information sharing, and partner trust management. As such, research papers scattered in different areas are integrated into this multi-disciplinary field. Future trends and challenges are also discussed in this paper.}

However, conventional MA is subject to limitations in that there is no scientific or systematic way in establishing the morphology of technology, and it is difficult to prioritize the alternatives. As a remedy, we propose a keyword-based MA that is supported by a systematic procedure and quantitative data for concluding the morphology of technology. To this end, a technology dictionary is developed by factor analysis for keywords that are extracted from patent documents through text mining. Then, the morphology of patents is identified based on the technology dictionary. By listing the occupied configurations of collected patents, the unoccupied territory of configurations are suggested as technology opportunities. Moreover, the priority of alternatives is concluded, and similar and substitutive technologies can be analyzed for the purpose of extending morphology structure. Technical and managerial strategy for in-house R&D or cross-licensing can also be supported by examining the morphology portfolio of technologies. A thin film transistor–liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) case is exemplified to illustrate the detailed procedure of this brand-new MA.}

However, health sectors of Ghana are facing a challenge in providing medical services with expected quality for an ever-increasing number of patients in response to competitive pressures. In such circumstances, the proper evaluation of hospital health-care delivery quality becomes critical. Thus, to achieve this goal, this paper proposes an integrated medical triangular fuzzy MULTIMOORA approach (IMTFMA). We firstly construct the appropriate evaluation criteria system based on the analysis of Ghana’s medical services. Then, to properly evaluate the weight of the criteria in a comprehensive manner, we determine the weight of criteria from subjective and objective perspectives. Meantime, we handle the fuzzy evaluation of experts for the criterion importance with the enhanced alpha-level sets method. According to the triangular fuzzy rating for hospitals provided by respondents, we further develop a novel evaluation method based on MULTIMOORA with the axiomatic design for accurately evaluating health-care delivery quality. The research is conducted on 8 selected hospitals, including 4 public and 4 private hospitals in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, with 24 criteria. 15 experts with rich experience in related fields and 480 respondents assessed the above 8 selected hospitals by questionnaires. According to the outcome of the empirical analysis, even though public hospitals benefit subsidy from the government, they perform abysmally low, whereas private hospitals which are self-sponsored rather perform extremely better than expectation.}

It enables methods to build a full information model of the manufacturing system, from the shopfloor functional structure to the basic production activities (operations, transport, inspection, etc.). The proposed method is based on a modified IDEF model that stores all kind of quantitative and qualitative information. A computer-based support tool has been developed to connect with the IDEF model, creating automatically a relational database through a set of algorithms. This manufacturing datawarehouse is oriented towards obtaining a rapid global vision of the system through multiple indicators. The developed tool has been provided with different scorecard panels to make use of KPIs to decide the best actions for continuous improvement. To demonstrate and validate both the proposed method and the developed tools, a case study has been carried out for a complex manufacturing system.}

abstract = {Most formal models are used in detailed design and focus on a single domain. Few effective approaches exist that can effectively tie these lower level models to a high level system model during design space exploration. This complicates the validation of high level system requirements during detailed design. In this paper, we define requirements for a high level model that is firstly driven by key systems engineering challenges present in industry and secondly connects to several formal and domain specific models used in model-based design. We analysed part of the systems engineering process at a company developing complex systems, by observing the design process and by analysing design documentation and development databases. By generalizing these observations, we identified several high level systems engineering challenges. They are compared to literature, focusing on reported systems engineering challenges and on existing approaches that incorporate high level models in model-based systems engineering. Finally, we argue that high level system models supporting design space exploration should be able to communicate information regarding design trade-offs (e.g. safety versus ease of use) effectively in a multidisciplinary setting. In our outlook, we propose how to continue our research, by recommending further research and defining a research question.}

This work aims at establishing a novel product definition and customisation system (PDCS) for organisations to meet this demand in today's competitive and globalised business climate. A prototype PDCS is proposed, from a design knowledge-handling viewpoint, in this paper. It comprises two phases, namely, product definition using the laddering technique and a novel design knowledge hierarchy (DKH), and product customisation using an integrated methodology of conjoint analysis (CA) and Kohonen association (KA) techniques. Basically, this system is a method of making design decisions via customer involvement, i.e. a strategy for transferring customer preference into a specific product concept. A case study on wood golf club design has been used to illustrate and validate the PDCS. The details of the validation are discussed.}

Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) are resources that can competitively aid modern industry in this volatile and complex environment. Thus, the evaluation, selection and implementation of more environmentally conscious AMT is important for meeting global requirements, especially with respect to environmental sustainability. Although a wide variety of methods to support AMT selection and evaluation processes exist, important aspects including green flexibility performance and psychological characteristics of decision makers under risk and uncertainty are missing. This paper presents a novel method for general investment appraisal of AMT, but especially introducing the context of green flexibility within manufacturing organizations. This paper aims to (1) develop effective green flexibility measures for manufacturing firms, incorporating various economic and environmental flexibility types, (2) introduce a hybrid possibility multiple criteria decision model for AMT evaluation and ranking integrating neighborhood rough set theory and cumulative prospect theory based on the three-parameter interval grey number, and (3) investigate the application of the proposed method in an illustrative case example to help manufacturing practitioner and researchers understand how to investigate various AMTs in this decision environment. Various advantages and disadvantages of the methodology are introduced. The results are evaluated with theoretical, methodological and managerial implications identified. This paper sets the foundation for significant future research in green manufacturing flexibility in an AMT environment.}

abstract = {Emergency supplies supplier selection can be regarded as a classic multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem. MAGDM is an interesting everyday problem full of uncertainty and ambiguity. As a new extension of fuzzy sets (FSs), spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) can express vague and complex information in MAGDM more comprehensively. The gray relational analysis (GRA) is a practical method to process MAGDM problems. Furthermore, the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) can well capture the psychological behaviors of decision makers (DMs) in the assessment process. Therefore, in this paper, a spherical fuzzy GRA based on CPT (SF-CPT-GRA) method is proposed for MAGDM issues. In the meantime, the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method is used under the spherical fuzzy environment to obtain unknown attribute weights, which enhances the rationality of weight information. Finally, an example of emergency supplies supplier selection is given to illustrate the practicality of the proposed method. Sensitivity analysis and further comparative analysis attest the stability and validity of SF-CPT-GRA method. The proposed method takes full account of the influence of DMs’ risk attitude on decision result, which integrates CPT with GRA (CPT-GRA) and uses SFSs to express DMs’ preference information, making the decision results more scientific. Moreover, the SF-CPT-GRA method provides some references for dealing with other complex uncertain problems and further extension of CPT-GRA method in other decision environments.}

In today's highly connected technology-driven economy, the production industry must rely on the best practices of collaborative engineering to stay competitive when designing, manufacturing and operating complex machines, processes, and systems on a global scale. Despite its importance, collaborative engineering is currently more of a practiced art than a scientific discipline. A better understanding of how engineers should collaborate with all stakeholders to accomplish complex tasks that fulfill our increasing social responsibilities is a grand challenge. However, because we currently lack well-defined sciences of human collaboration, we must first establish a scientific foundation of collaborative engineering to develop this emerging field into a rigorous discipline. This paper reports on the CIRP community's collective efforts to establish such a scientific foundation according to the “Observation → Hypothesis → Theory” development pathway. Our objective is to spearhead the rigorous development of this new human-centered engineering discipline, so that useful knowledge can be generated to educate students and practical guidelines can be developed to enable engineers to become more productive collaboration leaders in the new global production industry.}

Our previous study has attempted to fuse with DVs and PVs in CDCE, while this is only limit to few situations under benefit-like and cost-like evaluation criteria. For better CDCE, this study further fuses with DVs and PVs in more complex situations, and puts forward an improved version of rough distance to redefined ideal solution (RD-RIS II) in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) scope to select the optimal concept. Different from old RD-RIS in previous study, RD-RIS II not only supports the ideal solution definition (ISD) processes for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria, and but more importantly, it utilizes more useful information (value, feature, number and impact) from DVs and PVs to redefine the new positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS). Through the rough distance calculation, the alternative which is close to PIS and far away from NIS is selected as the best one. Besides, the feasibility of RD-RIS II is validated via the application in real design evaluation example, and three empirical comparisons confirm that RD-RIS II makes more comprehensive decision than other MCDM-based evaluation methods, especially when the choices of customers and designers are conflicting, therefore it could provide more reasonable evaluation result which has better credibility and stability than others.}

The failure of the reform is evidenced by a myriad of seemingly insurmountable economic, institutional, technical, financial and socio-political challenges exacerbated by the recent macroeconomic crisis. This paper performs a comparative analysis of the Nigeria reform with the “Standard model” of electricity reform to understand the root cause of the reform failures while taking cognizance of the starting conditions of Nigeria. Our result reveals that incomplete privatization coupled with the horizontal integration of the transmission and network operations, the underdeveloped gas supply infrastructure network and the ineffective/weak regulatory framework as the root problems. Thereafter, we recommended strengthening the regulatory framework as a good starting point to resolve sectoral problems. We argued that, considering the depth of the regulatory concerns, strengthening the framework will resolve the problems of investment, access and pricing and improve the overall sectoral performance (ex-post). Furthermore, we recommended the need for a workable market design and regulatory framework for decentralized solar PV generation and integration that is adaptable and nicely fits with a strengthened centralized generation framework.}

With these concerns in mind, this paper aims to implement a Cleaner Production program based on the plan-do-check-action method to reduce an organization's Cans Loss Index (CLI). For this study, a literature review was carried out; data were collected from institutional documents; and a direct field observation was made. We suggested to implement the following actions: training in standards; review of maintenance plans; controls per line segment; design of a matrix of responsibilities; alignment between different functions of the company; and equipment maintenance. As a result, the annual CLI fell from 0.97% (April–July) to 0.78% (end of year), representing a drop of more than 35% in costs from one semester to the next. In the second year, the CLI reached the goal of 0.60%, and costs have reduced by 28.91% in the first four months. Thus, both improvements in quality and productivity of the organization and significant reduction of waste in the production of beverage cans were achieved as a result of implementing the proposed Cleaner Production program.}

Governments are considering the implementation of the carbon tax to achieve lower greenhouse gas emission, higher national incomes and tax systems, deployments of renewable energy sources, and increasing the efficiency of the energy systems. Therefore, understanding the effects and consequences of the carbon tax policy on different economic, social welfare, and industries is imperative due to its impact on the costs of productions, inflation, and competitiveness of the industries. This research is to evaluate the impact of the carbon tax on the structure of the Finland industry as one of the high energy-intensive consumption countries. We use a computable general equilibrium model to create a connection between the effects of the carbon tax and economic indicators, production, and consumption sector. In this research, the effect of the carbon tax on the macro-economic and industry sector is studied. The results of this research indicate that the application of carbon tax policies leads to adverse effects on gross domestic production (GDP). By studying the fluctuations of the trade balance, export and import level, production price, and energy consumption level in the industry sector, considerable results have been achieved. For instance, considering the specific coverage of industries in Finland, they have higher competitiveness in general.}

Using a Fuzzy Delphi approach, this study maps and assesses the uncertainties associated with identifying indicators and ranked CE adoption barriers to achieve agreement with twelve respondents. Consensus was also achieved for C&DW measurement indicators. Concurrently, eleven separate interviews were conducted to understand CE's effectiveness in improving construction waste management. The results indicated that the most significant barrier was inefficient recycling policies to ensure high-quality recycled materials. The findings underscore that the influence of design, managerial, and legal barriers surpasses that of social, knowledge, and culture. Despite interviews highlighting a focus on recycling, reusing, and reducing raw materials, deeply established tendencies that prioritise linear economic models exist widely, and resource conservation is less considered. This study provides concrete CE implementation strategies for responsible consumption and production, assesses the challenges associated with CE adoption, and offers 25 industry-specific indicators for measuring C&DW CE implementation.}

In the same module, customer voices towards diverse design options called customer-sensitive design criteria are solicited from customer requirements. Subsequently, in the customer utility evaluation module, a measurement for customer desirability, i.e. customer utility index (CUI), is formulated using conjoint analysis (CA) technique.

abstract = {Common sense, as well as plenty of research, tells us that customer feedback can play an important role in successful product development efforts. By understanding the key factors that affect customers' evaluations of a new product, a project team improves its chances of making the right decisions throughout the design and development effort. However, customers typically lack a useful frame of reference for evaluating discontinuous, or really new products. In all likelihood, the key factors that affect customers' evaluations of radically new products differ from those for incremental innovations. Robert Veryzer describes the results of a study that examines the customer research efforts and findings of seven firms involved in the development of discontinuous new products. This study has the following objectives: gaining insight into the customer research inputs such companies use during the development of discontinuous new products, and exploring the critical factors that influence customers' evaluations of these really new products. The subjects in this study conducted relatively little formal customer research during the early stages of the NPD projects. The methods used for obtaining customer input during the concept generation and exploration stages were primarily qualitative. Although the companies in the study still did not focus consistently on customer issues during the technical development and design stage, the less discontinuous projects did use such traditional quantitative techniques as concept tests, clinics, and experiments during this phase of NPD. Throughout the projects in this study, the real opportunities for obtaining customer input came during the prototype testing and commercialization phases of the NPD projects. Several key factors appeared to influence customer evaluations of the products that were being developed by the NPD teams in this study. Lack of familiarity was manifested in customers' resistance to the new products in the study. Similarly, unfamiliarity with these new products often seemed to lead customers to focus on product attributes that development team members viewed as relatively unimportant. Other factors that affected customer evaluation of the products in this study included customer uncertainty about the benefits and risks associated with the product, customers' ability to understand how the product operates, perceptions of the product's safety, and product aesthetics.}

These changes are associated with the inclusion of an older workforce in knowledge work and the challenge they represent in adapting the work environment accordingly. In order to approach a more universal design of the work environment, industrial designers need support from user-sensitive inclusive design studies. While there are plenty of guidelines and tools containing relevant information, there is a need to develop more appropriate tools for Industrial Designers that cover the initial phase of the design process. This study provides a review of the available tools and guidelines and proposes a theoretical framework intended for developing a design guidance tool for inclusive workstation design.}

However, in the medical sector, although it generates a large amount of waste, application of circular design principles is difficult because of the clinical challenges of safety and sterility that reuse of products or materials entail. This paper categorizes and analyses existing instances of circular economy in the medical sector, using a literature review and examination of existing industry examples. This is used to identify challenges and unmet opportunities for circular design in the medical sector. The key factors affecting circular medical design are found to be device criticality in terms of sterilization requirements, device value and the organizational support structure around the device. A design heuristic and suggested strategies for circular design of medical products are proposed based on these findings.}

abstract = {The TOPSIS method, commonly known as the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions, is one of the most popular approaches used in multi-attribute decision making (MADM). The fundamental procedure of the traditional TOPSIS method is rather straightforward, the ranking position of an alternative depends on its relative closeness to the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution, respectively. In order to encompass uncertain and ambiguous decision elements, an extension of the original TOPSIS method has been coined. With the help of fuzzy sets based TOPSIS, an overwhelming trend of fuzzy decision making applications has been witnessed. In the present work, however, it is found that the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is unable to distinguish all the different alternatives under linguistic environment. Moreover, the undistinguishable alternatives are countless in quantity, and they have formed specific patterns with respect to the parameters of TOPSIS methods. To dampen this ranking ambiguity, we designed a set of supplemental methods to construct a revised TOPSIS approach with linguistic evaluations. Correspondingly, the sufficiency of the revised TOPSIS method to guarantee total orders has been proven. Furthermore, a numerical example concerning the production line improvement of a manufacturing company is demonstrated to validate the feasibility and supremacy of the proposed method. Finally, a series of further discussions are performed to shed some lights on the impacts caused by the changes of the alternative quantity, the attribute quantity, and the type of linguistic term.}

This dynamism is especially important in the critical product conceptualization stage. In customer-oriented design paradigm, most methodologies focus on exploiting end-user requirements, instead of considering project stakeholder requirements in a holistic manner. Previous research in the area of innovative product conceptualization focused on such aspects as functional, cognitive, marketing and commercial perspectives. It involves the participations of customers, designers, engineers, marketers and business managers. Accordingly, a stakeholder-oriented innovative product concept development system (IPCDS) is established to integrate the bespoke four perspectives so as to evaluate product concept innovation comprehensively. To resolve the incomplete, ambiguous, uncertain and subjective nature of innovative design knowledge, the product platform represented in a design knowledge hierarchy (DKH) is generated using general sorting. Subsequently, an innovative design criteria matrix (DCM) constructed using repertory grids technique is rated with regard to specific design option. The ratings are then used as input features to the fuzzy integrals technique, for the purpose of innovative design. A case study on cellular phone design is used for system illustration and the results are discussed on the basis of product concept innovation.}

abstract = {The 3D printed composite material selection is of great interest due to its extensive application prospect and can be considered as a challenging multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. The hesitation and uncertainty of experts are difficult to measure, and the high degree of interaction among criteria is often overlooked in the decision process. In addition, composites are required to serve in harsh environments for various mechanical and industrial fields, resulting in the degradation of mechanical properties. In this study, a hybrid multi-stage decision-making method is developed to conduct 3D printed composite material selection in harsh environments. The theory of probabilistic interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (PIVHFS) is proposed to characterize the decision-making information of experts, which can effectively quantify the assessment in uncertain environments. An integrated method that combines Choquet fuzzy integral and Shapley value is proposed to obtain the weight vector of criteria, which can reflect the mutual influence between criteria and their overall importance. The final decision-making result and the optimal alternative can be calculated by the PIVHFS-based Tomada de Decisão Interativa Multicritério and Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TODIM-TOPSIS) method. An empirical application, i.e., 3D printed composites in the background of automotive chassis, is applied to validate the application of the proposed method. Comparative analysis, sensitivity analysis, and managerial implications are also conducted to illustrate the validity of the method. This paper provides a valuable tool for addressing the material selection issue of 3D printed composites from a multi-criteria perspective.}

In this paper, we collected data from hedonic property value studies and merged these data with ancillary spatial data describing forest and socio-economic characteristics surrounding each study area to conduct a meta-analysis of the impact of tree canopy cover on the value of residential properties. The meta-analysis suggests that property-level tree cover of about 30% and county-level tree cover of about 38% maximize the implicit price of tree cover in property values. Currently, tree cover in the original study areas was about 14%, on average, around or near study properties. The empirical results, therefore suggest under investment of tree cover on private property from the perspective of individual property owners and from a societal perspective. The findings also have implications for community forest programs regarding planting trees and protection of mature trees to address potential changes in tree abundance, species diversity and stand age due to development and climate change.}

Also, an additional comparison technique for comparing sub-component alternatives is developed, called “scoring matrix”. In this technique, pair-wise comparisons are performed within one matrix for all possible criteria to measure the strength of one-to-one relationship between sub-component alternatives. This technique is more appropriate than traditional analytical hierarchy process in addressing problems such as the comparison of sub-component alternatives.

One of the essential elements of an urban development system is to identify the appropriate location for a logistics center. In practice, the issue of evaluating and selecting the most suitable geographical area for a logistics center is considered as a complex decision making problem that can be well formulated through analytical and mathematical models. An exhaustive review of literature indicates that no concrete study has still proposed any integrated evaluation approach for logistics center selection. Thus, this paper aims in developing a two-stage decision making model to find out the most preferred zone in the autonomous communities of Spain for establishment of logistics centers. In the first stage, the considered communities are compared based on five evaluation criteria using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to identify the efficient and inefficient alternatives. In the second stage, a model is designed to evaluate the performance of the efficient communities using rough full consistency (R-FUCOM) and combined compromise solution (R-CoCoSo) methods. The adopted model allows capturing the uncertainty and vagueness in the decision makers’ judgments as involved in the evaluation process with the use of rough set theory (RST). The R-FUCOM method is utilized to obtain the optimal weights of the criteria, while R-CoCoSo method is finally used to rank the efficient communities. In addition, sensitivity analyses are performed to validate the robustness of the derived results.}

In addition, the development and implementation of strategies such as those associated with concurrent engineering and the introduction of intelligent tools to support the design of complex products and systems has also changed the way in which such systems are conceived, implemented and manufactured. The aim of the paper is not however to attempt to address or answer specific questions as to the nature of mechatronics and its current and future standing as an approach to engineering design and development, but to initiate, provoke and stimulate debate and discussion on a range of mechatronics related issues, without necessarily attempting to provide answers or suggest new methods or approaches, relating to the future potential of and directions for mechatronics. In this respect therefore, while containing an element of review, the paper is intended as a discussion document structured around the author’s personal experience and perspective of mechatronics issues. Inherent to this questioning of the ways in which mechatronics may develop are the various attempts that have taken place over the years to provide a definition of mechatronics, either in the form of text or logo and whether these efforts have of themselves been a source of confusion as to both content and direction within mechatronics? In which case, might it be preferable for mechatronics practitioners to operate within their own particular context than to attempt to conform to a specific and overarching definition? Finally, it must also be made clear that in writing this paper that complete agreement with the reader as to the particular questions raised and comments made is neither sought nor intended.}

Recent studies have addressed the problem of modeling the success of a newly launched service by using different methods including artificial intelligence and model-based approaches. The ANFIS combines both the learning capabilities of a neural network and the reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic to give enhanced forecasting capabilities, as compared to using a single methodology alone. Data collected through a questionnaire that concerns the variables of developing a new service in tourism have been used as inputs to the model. A new technique that is achieved by using a method that cycles through all the inputs and builds ANFIS models has been used for input reduction and input selection. The final model has been trained by leaving out a part of the data. The model was then evaluated by the data that were left out. The forecasting accuracy of the ANFIS model is evaluated by calculating well-known performance measures. The results have shown that ANFIS provides a prudent way to capture uncertainty in relationships among input variables and output variables to forecast the successful launch of a new tourism service. A comparative analysis with other methodologies confirms the superiority of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Within new strategies for purchasing and manufacturing, suppliers play a key role in achieving corporate competition. Hence, selecting the right suppliers is a vital component of these strategies. In practice, vagueness and imprecision of the goals, constraints and parameters in this problem make the decision-making complicated. In spite of the importance of the problem the literature on this subject is relatively scarce. In this paper a fuzzy multiobjective linear model is developed to overcome the vagueness of the information. For the first time in a fuzzy supplier selection problem, an asymmetric fuzzy-decision making technique is applied to enable the decision-maker to assign different weights to various criteria. The model is explained by an illustrative example.}

Essentially, design concept evaluation is a complex multi-criteria decision-making process involving large amount of data and expert knowledge which are usually imprecise and subjective. Aiming to improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the design concept evaluation process, this paper proposes a novel method based on grey relation analysis and rough set theory. By integrating the strength of rough sets in handling vagueness and the merit of grey relation analysis in modeling multi-criteria decision-making, a rough number enabled grey relation analysis (called rough–grey analysis) is proposed to evaluate design concepts. The result of an example shows that the proposed rough–grey analysis has provided a novel alternative to perform design concept evaluation, in which the vague design information and expert knowledge can be modeled and analyzed more effectively and objectively.}

However, they have different concerns and focuses with regard to the new product design. Thus, these three processes are commonly conducted separately, leading to a sub-optimal and even sub-standard design. Such scenario indicates the need to incorporate the concerns of the three processes in the early stage of product design. However, no study has explored the incorporation of the concerns of the three processes into the product design. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology for integrating affective design, engineering, and marketing for defining design specifications of new products is proposed by which the concerns of the three processes can be considered simultaneously in the early design stage. The proposed methodology mainly involves development of customer satisfaction and cost models using fuzzy regression, generation of product utility functions using chaos-based fuzzy regression, formulation of a multi-objective optimization model and its solving using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). A case study was conducted for electric iron design to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}

On one side, it will be show that the control community is ready to step into the scene given the maturity of the existing models. On the other side, the optimization and control design have to deal with uncovered qualitative notions as the extinguish phenomena, scaling (extrapolation) of bioprocess operating regimes but also with the implementation challenges coming from the discretization issues, the asynchronous or event triggered functioning and the distributed control configurations.}

We report on two new versions ĀandB̄ in which the explicit energy-dependence of the original models A,B is removed in order to simplify application in nuclear structure calculations. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that the resulting SU(3) parameters like F/F+D ratios do depend on the specific model used and on approximations applied. While all models provide a reasonable description of the cross-section data, sizeable differences occur in spin observables, especially between our models and the Nijmegen soft-core model NSC. This demonstrates clearly that a measurement of such observables can easily discriminate between present models and thus shed some light on various aspects of the hyperon-nucleon interactions like e.g. the proper choice of parameter constraints.}

Guided by the overarching concept of digital transformation, data-driven Smart Product-Service Systems (SPSS) have emerged, prompting scholars to investigate development approaches tailored to diverse data sources. However, the current approaches employed in the construction of SPSS exhibit limited capability in processing vast amounts of user-generated unstructured data. The relationship between big data intelligence and personalized services remains undisclosed. Moreover, the current focus of SPSS orientation predominantly addresses end consumers or manufacturers, with inadequate attention given to dynamic collaborative models that involve multiple stakeholders. These gaps are particularly conspicuous in complex industries such as rehabilitation management. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel SPSS development approach that integrates a large vision model and the fuzzy-DEMATEL method. Specifically, a data-driven predictive assessment module was proposed, which constructs a medical image dataset and trains a rehabilitation predictive assessment model based on the transformer architecture. Secondly, personalized intervention services were generated, involving the representation of system elements, configuration, and optimization of service parameters. The fuzzy-DEMATEL method is mainly used for the initialization of service parameters. Then, interactive feedback is integrated into rehabilitation exercises for achieving continuous rehabilitation evaluation and service improvement. To validate the proposed approach, a FPRM-SPSS case was implemented, and it shows that the predictive assessment model achieved a high level of accuracy when applied to the clinical dataset constructed in this study, and the system was evaluated with high scores in user satisfaction.}

The equation was developed from a series of well-controlled, batch-biodegradation tests performed in an artificial stream with streambeds between 1.5 to 2 rock layers thick. The batch tests determined the sensitivity of substrate flux into the streambed biofilms to short-term changes in water velocity. Experimental results indicated that substrate flux into the cobble-streambed biofilms was more sensitive than flux into the gravel-streambed biofilms to short-term changes in water velocity, and that the cobble streambed had faster removal rates. Rates of substrate removal by both streambeds were much more sensitive to short-term changes in water velocity than would be predicted by previous mass transport models, which only addressed the transport of materials from the water column to the external (exposed) surface of the streambed. This greater than expected sensitivity to changes in water velocity suggests that interstitial biofilms play an important role in determining substrate removal rates in streams with sand-free gravel and cobble streambeds.}

abstract = {Amidst the current global disruptions on supply chains, having a comprehensive framework for evaluating supply chain resilience is of utmost importance. However, existing techniques suffer from limitations such as a lack of comprehensiveness and failure to account for the ripple effect, leading to biased assessments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation scheme that quantitatively describes the state of supply chain resilience under disruption propagation. The proposed approach introduces six metrics to assess the absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities of resilience. By considering these metrics, a disruption/recovery simulation procedure is employed to evaluate the resilience of three network structures widely found in real-world supply chain problems. The results indicate that networks exhibiting scale-free structure offer enhanced reliability, responsiveness, persistence, and quicker recovery time. To validate the applicability of the proposed approach in assessing supply chain resilience, it is implemented on two real-world supply chain networks. Additionally, this study uncovers the limitations of single-measure methodologies, which overlook the multi-faceted nature of resilience. It highlights the shortcomings of approaches that fail to accurately reflect resilience behaviour in the presence of ripple effects. These findings emphasize the significance of adopting a more comprehensive evaluation scheme, as proposed in this study, to achieve accurate results.}

Such an approach involves promoting simple and easy behaviours as entry points for more radical steps towards sustainability, referred to as “catalytic” or “wedge” behaviours. Despite the obvious need for innovative approaches to promote important pro-environmental behaviour, and sound theoretical backing for such concepts, there is a lack of research testing the key propositions of this approach. In a survey study based on a random sample of residents of the state of Maine, USA, we find that both everyday “green” behaviour and the acceptance of an expansion of wind power are rooted in environmental concern and that everyday “green” behaviour gives a significant contribution to predicting acceptance of wind power when controlling for environmental concern. Hence, the promotion of everyday “green” behaviours may prepare the grounds for increasing acceptance of more far-reaching changes in the population, such as an expansion of wind power.}

Based on the Wuli-Shili-Renli (WSR) theory and a multi-dimensional resilience framework, five key categories of risk factors affecting system resilience are identified: port infrastructure, port logistics operation organization, port personnel, port operational environment, and port emergency response and management. Through expert interviews, system component analysis, and a review of related literature across these five dimensions, 36 specific risk factors were identified to establish an initial set of system failure risk factors. Subsequently, a dual-factor screening method combining grey relational analysis and rank correlation was applied to simplify the initial set, constructing a system failure risk factor index system from a resilience perspective. Finally, a comprehensive model combining the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) method and the Total Adversarial Interpretation Structure Model (TAISM) was proposed. This model identifies and quantifies the complex correlations among system failure risk factors from a resilience perspective, revealing their relative importance and their impact on system resilience. The results indicate that system resilience is primarily influenced by internal factors such as the smoothness of collection and distribution operations, infrastructure service capacity, and the stability of technical support systems. External factors, such as the prevention capability for major emergency threats and the improvement of government supervision and coordination feedback mechanisms, also significantly impact system resilience. The complex interactions among key factors have a profound effect on system resilience, underscoring the need to enhance coordination and management measures to strengthen overall system resilience. This study provides a theoretical foundation for developing targeted strategies to enhance the resilience of automated container port logistics systems.}

This article presents the results of computer simulations to determine a magnetic field configuration that will allow lengthening of the macropulse and raising the repetition rate to the desired levels. The simulations predict a 75% drop in the cathode heating with negligible loss of beam current if the applied transverse magnetic field decays rapidly down the cavity axis. The effect of the deflection field on the beam's emittance will also be discussed.}

abstract = {Mobility hubs facilitate access to many transportation modes, such as public transportation, bike sharing, bus rapid transit (BRT), metro or car sharing, to enable travelers become more mobilized by providing advantage of their socio-economic benefits. Mobility hubs also help to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing private vehicle usage and giving equal priority to all modes of travel, including walking, cycling and other active forms of transport, i.e. public transport, ridesharing, taxis and private motor vehicles. Thus, emerging and inspiring the usage of diverse modes of transportation with less influence on the environment is one of the main policy to decrease people's environmental footprint. Since the locations of mobility hubs play an important role to achieve this goal by attracting travelers and encouraging people to use different modes of mobility options that has less impact on environment, the location selection of such hubs requires a strategic decision for authorities and policy makers. With this motivation, in this study, an integrated fuzzy multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that consists of interval type-2 fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and interval type-2 fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) is proposed to select the best location for a new mobility hub location in the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Among alternative locations Kadıköy is found as the best location for building a mobility hub to expand shared-use mobility and public transport options at a major transit station for Istanbulers in Anatolian side. At the end of the study, Sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate results of the proposed approach.}

In this context, how to combine heterogeneous information is a challenging question. This study proposes different methods to determine subjective and objective weights of criteria regarding the self-reporting, eye-tracking, and electroencephalogram data for the evaluation of product appearance design. We introduce the probabilistic linguistic term set with interval uncertainty (IUPLTS) to represent complex self-reporting data, and develop a method to aggregate IUPLTSs. An algorithm is proposed to fuse physiological data on the data layer and feature layer. To combine the obtained heterogeneous information, we define an objective weighting method that examines the differences in indicator data and the correlation between indicators, and then use a level difference maximization model to fuse subjective and objective weights. To ensure the stability of decision-making results for the problem involving a large number of indicators, we use the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) to rank alternatives. An example regarding the evaluation of automobile appearance design schemes is presented to show the validity and practicality of the proposed method. The prototype support system of the proposed method has been developed and is freely available at https://github.com/BitSecret/DAQQSO.}

This required identifying the most cost-beneficial projects for maximizing the net benefit to the public and allocating resources most efficiently. To evaluate different revitalization strategies, we used a hierarchical network model based on various factors, and we present the interactions of those factors. The proposed ANP model consists of a control hierarchy and a network of connections between the clusters of alternatives, actors, and criteria. The strategic criteria were included into the model to rate benefits (B), opportunities (O), costs (C), and risks (R). A synthesis of alternatives was finally obtained using rated BOCR. In this paper, we suggest an improved methodology, one that uses an integrated approach and reflects the interdependencies between the evaluation criteria and candidate projects. The management of the Alishan Forest Railway has implemented the processing system proposed by this research and suggested to the government the best alternative strategies.}

We aimed to prove that an efficient technology of protective biofortification with selenium of crops would solve two technical problems of cruciferous cultivation into a semi-arid area, with selenium soil deficit: (i) safety supplementation of food chain and, concomitant, (ii) enhanced water use efficiency. Normal watered plants were irrigated at a rate of 100% crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Water stressed cabbage and cauliflower plants were irrigated under deficit conditions, at a 75% ETc. Six different treatments, including the new biostimulant composition and its ingredients, separate and/or in combination, were applied on cabbage and cauliflower, in a field experiment, organised in split plot design, with three replications. The treatments were applied by foliar spraying, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after seedlings transplantation in the field. During vegetation, physiological parameters (chlorophyll a fluorescence and stomatal conductance) were assayed. After harvesting, yield parameters were determined, for each treatment applied to both normal watered and water stressed plants. We calculated the water use efficiency as ratio between the marketable yield and the water used. We tested in field conditions this new biostimulant composition, which allows to obtain, under conditions of moderate water stress, a marketable production similar to that of the normal watered crop. Physiological parameters demonstrated also enhanced water-use efficiency on cabbage and cauliflower treated with the new biostimulant composition, containing sodium selenate, betaine and spraying adjuvant based on ethyl rapeseedate.}

Existing expert-based and data-based roadmapping processes consume a lot of resources, are difficult to update, and can be biased towards experts’ subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an automated deep learning model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based technology roadmapping method. The proposed framework consists of two modules. Module 1 uses the GAN model to train the Roadmap, and trains the GAN model by the knowledge of experts in the technology roadmap using the existing technology roadmap data. The defined model consists of a generator that receives the node of the technology roadmap and generates the next node, and discriminators that verify the generated node, and provide feedback. Module 2 expands the roadmap, generates candidate nodes using the trained GAN model, and merges suitable nodes into the roadmap. To select the appropriate configuration for the proposed framework, experiments were conducted in terms of data format and model layer. Also, to validate the model presented in this study, the analysis was performed by selecting the renewable energy industry as a target technology of the analysis.}

abstract = {In order to compete in the market, companies have to produce the right products with a shorter time to market and at lower costs than before. Shorter time to market requires the product development process (PDP) to change the way of working from the classical `wait and react’ to anticipating and preventing problems as early as possible in the development process. This requires a new, and different role for the quality and reliability tests used. While in a classical PDP products could be tested when available from (pilot) production, a modern, time-driven development process requires optimisation long before larger series of products are available. Accelerated stress testing (AST) is a classical solution for the implementation of tests where product failures need to be activated faster (and cheaper) in a well-controlled environment at the early stage of the PDP. This paper reviews the classical AST strategy and some most recent AST strategies. It demonstrates that these accelerated test strategies are mainly based on generic lists of failure mechanisms and have only very limited relation with the actual failure rate curve of products. The theoretical background of the four-phase roller coaster failure rate curve is addressed and from this an alternative AST strategy is developed based on the relevant phases of the roller coaster curve using a concept called stressor-susceptibility analysis. A discussion, on the application of the proposed AST strategies and their impacts on the four-phase roller-coaster curves, is given at the end.}

Findings reveal that Requirements, Process, and Test TD are most common, while Build, Versioning, Manufacturing, Code, and Maintenance/Service TD are less frequent. Key causes include ”other priorities”, ”lack of time”, ”historically grown products”, ”lack of market analysis” and ”copy-paste-modify without revising tolerances.” The research identifies correlations between TD subtypes and causes/consequences in relation to company size, experts’ experience, and position, utilizing the Chi-square test and PrefixSpan algorithm. The study also maps the contagious character of TD using Neo4J graphical representation. This first in-depth analysis of TD causal chains in industrial automation contributes qualitatively to understanding TD patterns, helping researchers and practitioners assess TD contagiousness, comprehend its effects, prevent diffusion, and develop repayment strategies To the best of our knowledge, this study’s quantitative analysis approach provides the foundation that will enable future research identifying TD metrics and TD management in multidisciplinary engineering.}

abstract = {The explosion of information and information technology has led many firms to evolve a dispersed product development process with people and organizations spread throughout the world. To coordinate such dispersed processes a critical role of managers is to establish and foster a culture that implicitly rewards and motivates product development teams to perform against a set of strategic metrics such as customer satisfaction, time to market, defect reduction, or platform reuse. We focus on a practical method to fine-tune a firm’s relative emphasis on these metrics. In particular, we seek to advise a firm how to modify their emphasis on each metric in order to improve profits. We use a thermostat analogy based on an adaptive control feedback mechanism in which we estimate the incremental improvements in priorities that will increase profits. Iterations seek to maximize profits even if the environment is changing. In developing the metric thermostat we recognize that there are hundreds of detailed actions, such as the use of the house of quality and the use of robust design, among which the product development team must choose. We also recognize that team members will act in their own best interests to choose the actions that maximize their own implicit rewards as determined by the metrics. Management need not observe or dictate these detailed actions, but rather can control the process by establishing implicit weights on the metrics. The thermostat works by changing those implicit weights. We define the problem, introduce the adaptive control mechanism, modify “agency” theory to deal with incremental changes about an operating point, and derive methods that are practical and robust in light of the data that firms have available. Our methods include statistical estimation and internal surveys. The mathematics identify the critical few parameters that need be determined and highlight how to estimate them. Both the measures and the estimation are illustrated in an initial application to a large office-equipment firm with $20 billion in revenue. The metrics thermostat suggests that this firm has about the right emphasis on time-to-market, but has overshot on platform reuse and has lost its focus on customer satisfaction. We describe how the firm reacted to the recommendations and changed its organization.}

In a system design environment, where sustainability risk assessment is the focus of the designer, the systematic consideration of sustainability risk during the conceptual design stage is a function of environmental impact of a system. This research paper presents a framework for sustainability risk assessment of a mechanical system at conceptual design stage. The system parameters are identified. These parameters are referred as Sustainability Risk Assessment parameters. Based on the parameters identified, the relationships among these parameters are also identified. These relationships are represented by means of a sustainability risk assessment graph. To avoid complexity of the graph while analyzing the system, it is represented by a matrix, which helps in developing the sustainability risk assessment expression. For analytical assessment, permanent risk function is obtained. Finally, an index is developed for evaluating various mechanical design systems from risk consideration. This framework will help designers while developing mechanical systems at conceptual design stage considering risk through sustainability. The proposed approach has been applied to a material selection case study. The relationships among various sustainability risk assessment parameters are established. Finally graph theory and matrix approach is applied for ranking of various design alternatives from sustainability risk assessment point of view.}

In the era of non-human innovation intermediaries, we should begin to view NLP not only as a useful technology applied in different innovation practices but also as an intermediary orchestrating valuable information. Previous research has not taken this perspective, and knowledge about its intermediation activities and functions is limited. This study reviews 167 academic articles to better understand how NLP approaches can enrich intermediation in early-stage innovation search. It identifies 18 distinctive innovation practices taking over activities like forecasting trends, illustrating technology and idea landscapes, filtering out distinctive contributions, recombining domain-specific and analogous knowledge, or matching problems with solutions. While certain NLP capabilities complement each other, the analysis shows that the choice of the most appropriate approach depends on the characteristics of the innovation practice. Innovation researchers and practitioners should rethink current roles and responsibilities in AI-based innovation processes.

abstract = {The paper presents a methodological framework based on the analytical network process (ANP) approach for selecting knowledge management (KM) solutions for complaint knowledge transfer to product development. Existing approaches to technical complaint management (TCM) mostly neglect the necessity of knowledge transfer, and thus do not address quality or sustainability issues. The framework addresses this shortcoming by providing a systematic approach for selecting appropriate KM solutions in a given organizational environment. Based on extensive literature review competing objectives, diverse criteria as well as various organization specific factors have been identified and integrated into the framework. An expert study amongst 15 KM experts was conducted for parametrizing the model (i.e., to evaluate KM solutions with respect to the identified objectives and criteria). The framework enables long-term effects on failure-based learning and facilitates the design of a more sustainable TCM.}

abstract = {In industry it is not well realised that a service centre is potentially one of the major contributors to quality improvement. Service is able to collect vital information about the field behaviour of products in interaction with customers. If this information is well analysed and communicated, the recurrence of old problems in new products will drastically be reduced and so will the expenses on recalls, repairs, warranties, and liabilities. In this paper we discuss the kind of information a service centre has to collect and some quality-related metrics that organisations use, like the field call rate, or should use, like the hazard function.}

abstract = {Reports of deteriorating mental health among citizens constitute an urgent global health alert. Electronic mental health (EMH) platforms are a great resource for mitigating mental health disorders. Extant literature on EMH has determined the attributes and indicators that reflect the feasibility, acceptability and safety of EMH platforms. However, these evaluation indicators are complex and usually conflict each other in the decision-making process. Moreover, the evaluation indicators are qualitative in nature and may be characterized by fuzziness and imprecision. Therefore, selecting an EMH platform becomes a complex cognitive process. Given the ubiquity of EMH platforms and the absence of a comprehensive decision-making model, we present a novel probabilistic reliable linguistic multi-attribute decision making (PRLMADM) model. With this model, we employ the probabilistic reliable linguistic term sets (PRLTSs) to solve decision makers’ (DMs) uncertainty and reliability of evaluation information. We construct a novel Pearson correlation measure for PRLTSs and extend it to design a weighting method known as probabilistic reliable linguistic CRiteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (PRL-CRITIC). Employing the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multicriteria Decision Making) and the PROBID (Preference Ranking on the Basis of Ideal-average Distance) techniques, we propose the probabilistic reliable linguistic (PRL) TODIM-based PROBID ranking approach, which considers the DMs’ bounded rationality. Finally, we present an illustrative example of EMH platform selection to prove the applicability of the proposed model. We demonstrate the benefits of our probabilistic reliable linguistic TODIM-based PROBID model through a series of comparisons and sensitivity analyses.}

However, in this article, to find the most dependable supplier for an Indian heavy locomotive firm, some of the selection criteria like quality, delivery, price and service are employed. Subsequently, an integrated model is proposed for objective assessment of suppliers by integrating three methods namely, Taguchi loss function, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Finally, two cases of the firm under study, along with sensitivity analysis, are considered to demonstrate the credibility of the model.}

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis for environmental risk assessment (ERA) with regard to avoiding and eliminating damages and loss under natural disasters in international airport projects. It starts from an assumption that the strategy of eliminating damages and losses under natural disasters is related to the location selection problem, and it is necessary to use the multi-criteria decision analysis for calculated decision-making support. The paper uses the analytic network process (ANP) to demonstrate one of its utility modes in decision-making support to location selection problems, which aims at an evaluation of different projects from different locations. A set of generic criteria for risk assessment at international projects was put forward to support ANP modelling, and it was due to the consideration of social, technical, economic, environmental and political (STEEP) criteria related to the built, social and natural (BSN) trinity environment of international airport projects. At the end, an experimental case study on three international hub airports in China is given to test the ANP model called ERA.Airport, and it is concluded that ANP can be effectively used for risk assessment in the specific utility mode. The ERA.Airport is a generic multi-criteria decision-making model and can be used across the world for accurate environmental risk assessment for international airports.}
