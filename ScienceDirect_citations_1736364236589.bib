abstract = {Aiming at the design contradiction between the requirements and the structure in the case adaptation, an extension integration model of contradictory problems is established. And the corresponding solution method is given. Firstly, the extension integration model is constructed by analyzing the incompatible problems and antithetical problems in the case adaptation and separating the extension set of customer requirements, and the extension transformation theory is introduced into the case adaptation. Secondly, the extension integration model is solved by combining the extension strategy generation method and the transforming bridge method. And the obtained scheme is evaluated and selected based on the extension superiority evaluation; Then, store the adapted case into the case library. At the same time, the extension knowledge involved in the process of solving the contradictory problem is extracted and stored in the design knowledge base as a reference for subsequent design. Finally, taking the SK-15 vacuum pump as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the above method are verified.}

abstract = {There is an urgent need to shift away from the present heavy dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy sources, particularly in the context of the energy-intensive oil refining process. Built on the Solar Reactive Utilization framework, this study presents an innovative concept called the Solar Oil Refinery, applying solar energy in the energy-demanding oil refining. Herein, a solar multi-energies-driven hybrid chemical oil refining system, exemplified by residual oil cracking, has been successfully developed and formulated in solar-driven thermo-electrochemical cracking of residual oil. This integrated solar oil refining system, coupled with solar pyrolysis and electrolysis - synergistic thermo- and electrochemistry, can greatly promote the “cracking” of residual oil. Owing to the simultaneous applications of solar heat, solar electricity, and the relevant chemical reactions, the system can significantly improve solar utilization efficiency, the cracking rate and the hydrogen yield. In the operation, solar energy, co-functioning with oil, is converted into light hydrocarbon fuel with the advantage of excess hydrogen energy storage. Notably, the temperature required for solar oil cracking is considerably reduced compared with that of conventional pyrolysis, with a cracking rate of 11.2% at the initial temperature of 230 ℃. As the temperature rises, the cracking rate is elevated, reaching 45.22% at 275 ℃ and an impressive 89.85% at the typical temperature of 425 ℃, in contrast to the 44.25% achieved in conventional pyrolysis. In the conventional pyrolysis, the gas, liquid, solid products and unreacted residual oil are accounted for 3.98%, 24.57%, 15.57%, and 55.75%, respectively, but, in the solar oil cracking, the gas, liquid, solid products and residual oil improve to 13.2%, 75.1%, 1.65%, and 10.05%, respectively. This process is characterized by a substantial increase of gas and liquid phase products, coupled with a significant reduction of solid phase products and unreacted residual oil. At 425 ℃, a noteworthy increase of 10.7% in gasoline, 21.7% in diesel, and 18.13% in vacuum gas oil occurs in solar oil cracking compared to conventional pyrolysis. The presence of light hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds are detected in both gas-phase and liquid-phase products. In solar oil cracking, the hydrogen yield has been significantly boosted to 63.0% in the combined action of the hydrolysis and electrolysis, surpassing the hydrogen yield achieved through the conventional pyrolysis. The simultaneous utilization of both solar heat and solar electricity which substantially enhances total solar utilization efficiency and the oil conversion rate, can effectively reduce the consumption of the fossil energy in petroleum industry.}

This study aims to apply System Dynamics (SD) to analyze the optimal timing of container ship orders by considering the uncertain shipping environment. The collected monthly data for 12 years was obtained from the China seaborne container trade (CSCT) and the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI). Containership fleet development and the prices of new and second-hand container ships were classified based on five container vessel sizes (January of 2004–December of 2015). The period of simulation for this study was from 2004 to 2020. To analyze the optimal timing for the container ship orders, container ship fleet development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for ship order placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for shipping companies to order ships without the risk of revenue loss. The second best time period is May 2018, before the CCFI recovery of May 2019. The third best time for ship orders is later in 2020 for a CCFI recovery after 2021.}

abstract = {We have developed a novel CO2 exposure system for natural vegetation that is a middle ground between Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) and traditional open-top chambers (OTC). Screen-Aided CO2 Control (SACC) technology uses much less CO2 per experiment and per replicate than FACE and is superior to OTCs in terms of its effects on microclimate. A SACC unit consists of a thin metal frame, a clear plastic “screen”, and a pipe at the base of the screen through which CO2 enriched jets of air are directed into the unit. There is a gap between the ground and the bottom of the pipe and the screen is relatively short in comparison to the maximum height of the vegetation. Our SACC units are hexagonal and enclose a ground area of 1.27 m2. SACC works in the following way: 1) the screen breaks the wind and creates turbulent mixing within the unit, 2) the mixing of the outside air with the CO2 enriched jets of air generates relatively uniform CO2 concentrations within the screened-in vegetation, and 3) a fully automated system monitors CO2 concentrations and adjusts CO2 injection rates for each unit every ca. 10 minutes to maintain preset CO2 concentrations. Twenty-four hour means of CO2 concentrations in the middle of a unit are typically maintained within 1 μl l−1 of their set points. Spatial variation and short-term fluctuations in CO2 concentration are similar to those in OTCs and FACE. CO2 consumption at our site is 5 kg CO2 day−1 replicate−1 for a total of ca. 30 tons per year for 20 elevated CO2 SACC units. Compared to OTCs, SACC units have reduced temperature peaks at full sunlight, minimal effects on solar radiation, reduced rainfall interception by chamber walls, and freer access of small animals to experimental plots. We believe that SACC is the best method for exposing short stature vegetation to elevated CO2 when financial constraints do not allow for a properly replicated FACE experiment.
Résumé
Nous avons développé un nouveau système d'exposition au CO2 pour la végétation naturelle qui est à mi-chemin entre FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) et les chambres non-couvertes traditionnelles (OTC). La technologie SACC (Screen-Aided CO2 Control) utilise beaucoup moins de CO2 par expérience et par réplicat que FACE et est supérieure aux OTC en termes d'effets sur le micro-climat. Une unité SACC consiste en un fin cadre de métal, un «écranå de plastique transparent et, à la base de l'écran, un tuyau à travers lequel des jets d'air enrichi en CO2 sont dirigés vers l'intérieur de l'unité. Il y a un vide entre le sol et le bas du tuyau; l'écran est relativement bas par comparaison avec la hauteur maximale de la végétation. Nos unités SACC sont hexagonales et incluent une surface de 1,27 m2. SACC fonctionne de la manière suivante: 1) l'écran brise le vent et crée un mélange turbulent à l'intérieur de l'unité; 2) le mélange de l'air extérieur avec les jets d'air enrichi en CO2 génère des concentrations en CO2 relativement uniformes dans la végétation située à l'intérieur de l'écran et 3) un système entièrement automatisé contrôle les concentrations en CO2 et ajuste les taux d'injection de CO2 pour chaque unité toutes les 10 minutes environ afin de maintenir les concentrations en CO2 prédéfinies. Les moyennes sur 24 heures des concentrations en CO2 au centre d'une unité sont typiquement maintenues à moins de 1 μl l−1 de leurs points de départ. La variation spatiale et les fluctuations à court terme de la concentration en CO2 sont similaires à celles des OTC ou de FACE. La consommation de CO2 sur notre site est de 5 kg jour−1 replicat−1 pour un total d'environ 30 tonnes par an, pour 20 unités SACC. Par comparaison avec les OTC, les unités SACC ont des pics de température réduits en plein soleil, des effets minimaux sur la radiation solaire, une interception réduite des précipitations par les murs de la chambre et un accès plus libre des petits animaux aux placettes expérimentales. Nous croyons que SACC est la meilleure méthode pour exposer une végétation basse à un enrichissement en CO2 lorsque les contraintes financières ne permettent ps de reproduire correctement une expérience avec FACE.}

Suppliers, as the first layer of the supply chain network, pose a great impact on environmental pollution. Therefore, in this paper a hybrid approach of fuzzy analysis network process (FANP), fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL), and multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) models are developed for circular supplier selection and order allocation in a multi-product circular closed-loop supply chain (C-CLSC) considering multi-depot, capacitated green routing problem using heterogeneous vehicles. In this regard, a mathematical model concerning an inventory-location-routing problem is developed that minimises cost and shortage simultaneously and also deals with imposed uncertainties. A fuzzy solution approach is proposed to simultaneously incorporate uncertainty and to change the multi-objective model into a single-objective model. To motivate the practical aspect of the proposed model in real world applications, we applied the model to an automotive timing belt manufacturer. The obtained results indicate that the proposed model is cost efficient and environmentally friendly for CLSC network designs.}

Specifically, we used eye-tracking technology to capture users' visual sequence of design morphology for NEV-IC. We then adopted entropy-TOPSIS to compute the ranking of morphological components based on experts’ opinions, establishing the coupling between users' visual perception and experts' opinion to obtain the key morphological dataset of NEV-IC based on user visual sequence. To tackle the shortcomings of LSTM, meanwhile, we employed the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM model. Moreover, an attention mechanism has been introduced to address LSTM's difficulty in preserving key information when processing the sequential data, enabling a stronger focus on critical sequential features within the user's visual path. To assess the efficacy of the proposed SSA-LSTM-Attention model, a dataset incorporating user emotional imagery was constructed, within the research framework of Kansei engineering (KE). This dataset, in conjunction with the morphological dataset of visual sequential features, was applied to our model. The study results indicated that compared to traditional machine learning models like BP neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), and LSTM, our model performed better in capturing the nonlinear relationship between user sentiment and design features. Additionally, it exhibited higher predictive accuracy, better generalization ability and stronger robustness.}

Besides, a new fuzzy extension for the best-worst method is proposed considering trapezoidal fuzzy membership functions that can cover uncertainty under imprecise environments. This study makes a contribution to the literature of sustainable supply chains in the sense that it facilitates the computational complexity of previous decision-making approaches by collecting the most relevant criteria and a straightforward fuzzy process.

In the current context, the development of an adequate costing system is of extreme importance in organisations because they feel the need to properly manage the resources at their disposal and control their costs to achieve efficient and effective management. Thus, this study aims to analyse international publications on the activity-based costing system in recent years, identifying trends in evolution and future research opportunities. Based on bibliometric techniques, the outputs obtained in the Web of Science (n = 752) and Scopus (n = 1107) databases were analysed in bibliometrix R package to make a systematic mapping and review of the literature. After removing duplicates, we obtained a final output of 1419 articles. The analysis of these publications points to a growing trend in the publication of articles on ABC, highlighting publications in partnership and their dispersion in magazines from different areas. The bibliometric analysis carried out results on the authors’ global research performance over time, and we highlighted the pioneering publications every five years and analysed the general evolution. When analysing based on publication authors over time, we highlighted the main research themes and countries where studies had been carried out. On the other hand, we also highlighted the collaborative network between institutions, authors, and countries over time.}

However, pertinent literature advocates the uncertainty assessment of the terminal scheme, but ignores the function interactions and the uncertain behavior selections derived from user’s preferences in the function-behavior-structure (FBS) design process. Besides, the decision-makers (DM)’s fuzzy judgments for behavior selections in the FBS model are not been addressed. To fill this gap, a conceptual design decision approach by integrating rough Bayesian Network (BN) and game theory under uncertain behavior selections is proposed, which could provide a graphic probabilistic model-based reasoning for the uncertain design process. In this approach, firstly, a sub-function importance model is constructed to achieve the extraction of the core sub-function module. Then, BN approach is developed to analyze the effect of uncertain behavior on the solution of sub-functions, and then support to predict whether to adopt the optimal scheme. And sub-function BN model is constructed based on the FBS model, and an initial BN model is updated by rough set technology. Finally, the probability distribution of uncertain behavior in interactive sub-functions is obtained from BN model, which is used to transform the uncertain behavior solving problem among sub-functions into a non-cooperative game process based on behavioral probabilities, and the optimal scheme is selected. A case study of tree climbing and trimming machine is used to validate the proposed approach and five principle solutions are selected, then the comparison results showed that the sub-function BN is able to provide a valuable design recommendation in new product development.}

abstract = {As to a new smart factory model, the make-to-order (MTO) strategy challenges small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. It enables quick response manufacturing (QRM) while responding to diversified, dynamic, and low-volume customer demands. Highly complex products are more common in low-volume than high-volume production, where high-volume production is often linked to simple products. In contrast, low-volume production is often related to customized products. Aiming to face these customized production requirements and accelerate strategic, innovative system design, a novel strategic servitization design model named the “4S” model is proposed. It’s a holistic design method that integrates the SERVQUAL model, the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), and the Kano model to effectively generate design strategies and concepts. Based on 4S, four key design approach phases are integrated: service experience survey, service quality diagnosis, strategic Kano-based design, and servitization system design phases. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, an example of a “make-to-order smart intralogistics and production system” (MTO-SIPS) is addressed to illustrate the requirement elicitation process. In phase 1, knowledge elicitation by expert interview is conducted. In phase 2, service quality gaps and contradictions are analyzed and eliminated by the extended SERVQUAL model and service TRIZ. New service innovative principles are generated. In phase 3, a kano-based survey is conducted and analyzed to understand customer requirements to determine suitable design strategies and conceptualize new service system functions. In phase 4, an expected servitization system was designed. Then, a maturity assessment was conducted to evaluate industry perceptions to evaluate the service’s acceptance. It is envisaged that this explorative study can offer valuable insights for the service providers who would like to conduct strategic servitization design for Industry 4.0-based smart intralogistics and production.}

Since the subjectivity, imprecision and vagueness in the estimates of a performance rating enter into multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems, fuzzy set theory provides a mathematical framework for modelling vagueness and imprecision. In the proposed approach, an attribute based aggregation technique for heterogeneous group of experts is employed and used for dealing with fuzzy opinion aggregation for the subjective attributes of the decision problem. The propulsion/manoeuvring system selection as a real case study is used to demonstrate the versatility and potential of the proposed method for solving fuzzy multiple attributive group decision-making problems. The proposed method is a generalised model, which can be applied to great variety of practical problems encountered in the naval architecture from propulsion/manoeuvring system selection to warship requirements definition.}

As a dynamic and iterative activity, the consensus reaching process (CRP) of PDDM always involves heterogeneous, vague, and inconsistent information, which makes it challenging to adjust decision-makers’ judgement to achieve an acceptable consensus level. To address this issue, triangular fuzzy numbers were introduced to depict decision-makers’ heterogeneous judgement. The indicator weights were determined by integrating the fixed weight obtained from the interval analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and the variable weight acquired using the maximizing deviation method. Decision-makers’ weights were identified through a combination of the uncertainty degree measured by fuzzy entropy and the consistency degree solved by a distance minimizing model of the PDDM matrix. A dynamic CRP for PDDM was proposed by adjusting decision-makers’ judgement based on their trust relationships and updating the PDDM matrix in an evolutionary manner. A case study is conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Due to increased competition and the advent of mass customization, many software firms are utilizing product families – groups of related products derived from a product platform – to provide product variety in a cost-effective manner. The key to designing a successful software product family is the product platform, so it is important to determine the most appropriate product platform scope related to business objectives, for product line development.
Aim
This paper proposes a novel method to find the optimized scope of a software product platform based on end-user features.
Method
The proposed method, PPSMS (Product Platform Scoping Method for Software Product Lines), mathematically formulates the product platform scope selection as an optimization problem. The problem formulation targets identification of an optimized product platform scope that will maximize life cycle cost savings and the amount of commonality, while meeting the goals and needs of the envisioned customers’ segments. A simulated annealing based algorithm that can solve problems heuristically is then used to help the decision maker in selecting a scope for the product platform, by performing tradeoff analysis of the commonality and cost savings objectives.
Results
In a case study, PPSMS helped in identifying 5 non-dominated solutions considered to be of highest preference for decision making, taking into account both cost savings and commonality objectives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that human experts perceived value in adopting the method in practice, and that it was effective in identifying appropriate product platform scope.}

We have studied the distribution of Li and B in two migmatitic areas: the Peña Negra Anatectic Complex (central Spain) and the migmatites and leucogranites associated with the Ronda peridotites (southern Spain). They represent two contrasting cases in the behaviour of volatiles, particularly B, during anatexis. The Peña Negra migmatites are dominated by diatexites where it is possible to distinguish granitic leucosomes, melanosomes, metric to decimetric leucogranitic segregates, and decimetric to metric sillimanite-rich restitic enclaves. All lithologies are characterized by low B concentrations (mean values <30 ppm), and B is enriched in melanosomes/restites with respect to leucosomes/leucogranites. This may be due to the fact that a notable proportion of B can reside in restitic sillimanite. B concentrations in leucosomes and leucogranites can be explained by closed system anatexis. At Ronda, metatexitic and diatexitic migmatites underlie the Ronda peridotites, and diatexite and leucogranite dikes intrude the peridotites. Diatexites underlying the peridotites are characterized by cordierite+biotite±garnet as ferromagnesian phases, with rare or absent tourmaline, low B contents (<10 ppm), and cordierite±garnet leucosomes. Leucogranite dikes have high B concentrations (mean value≈400 ppm), with tourmaline being a common and, sometimes, the most abundant ferromagnesian phase. A genetic relationship between diatexites and leucogranites is strongly suggested by the presence of dikes of diatexites intruding the bottom of the peridotites. We conclude that B in the leucogranites may stem from the dissolution of tourmaline originally present in the metasediments, or infiltration of B-rich aqueous fluids into the anatectic zone. According to recent experimental work, textures in some tourmaline-rich Ronda leucogranites suggest initial B2O3 contents in the melt higher than the present measured concentrations. Preliminary experimental results presented in this paper propose that this difference is not due to water activities in the melt. Rapid crystallization of the melts following undercooling may explain the existence of abundant euhedral tourmaline in leucogranites with low aluminium saturation index (ASI=molar Al2O3/(CaO+Na2O+K2O)) and relatively low B contents.}

abstract = {One of the main challenges that water supply managers face is that of minimizing the water lost through leakage from the systems that they operate. To minimize water losses, substantial amounts of money must be invested every year in leak detection and repairs. This investment is usually balanced by the benefits derived from the use of the recovered water. Nevertheless, this scheme of economic assessment does not reflect the whole dimension of the profit-earning capacity of repairing leaks; and the associated benefits go beyond just the economic value of the recovered water. In this paper, we consider a new economic assessment approach that includes all the costs incurred by the existence of leaks and the benefits derived from their control. The main difficulty derives from the fact that comparisons with regard to certain properties will only work for properties with well-defined scales of measurement. The analytic hierarchy process of Saaty (2008) [1] provides a useful way to establish relative scales that are derived by making pairwise comparisons using numerical judgments from an absolute scale of numbers. The unique largest eigenvalue and the Perron eigenvector of the matrix of criteria provide, taking into account the properties that this matrix exhibits, the necessary information for dealing with complex decisions that involve dependence and feedback. These decisions are analyzed in the context of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks. We also present a method for improving the consistency of the comparisons — as consistency may be affected by subjectivity. The main conclusion is that water supply managers and authorities should shift direction from purely economic policies based on passive leakage control towards new social and environmental policies that consider more proactive actions.}

To explore parents’ perceptions of childhood behavior problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among a sample of African American (AA) parents.
Methods
Five focus groups were conducted in inner-city Baltimore and the Washington, DC, metropolitan region with 5 to 7 AA parents per group. Adults with children under the age of 17 years were recruited from pediatric practices. One investigator moderated each focus group, and a second took notes. Sessions averaged 1.5 hours long, were recorded on audiotape, and were transcribed verbatim. The narrative data were coded for recurring themes.
Results
Five major themes emerged from the analysis: causes of behavioral problems in children, the legitimacy of ADHD as a diagnosis, attitudes about doctors, opinions of medication, and perceptions of the school environment. Many participants felt that behavior issues, including those accompanying ADHD, were caused by inappropriate parenting and disciplinary practices. Some viewed the diagnosis as a label applied with racial inequality to exert social control over AAs. Several expressed distrust in physicians who were quick to make a diagnosis of ADHD and recommend medications. Others worried that medication would lead to drug addiction in adulthood. Some perceived that children were labeled with ADHD because of poor educational environments that were unresponsive to the needs of AA children.
Conclusions
These focus groups identified important community perceptions about ADHD and its medical treatment. Understanding how these perceptions contribute to racial disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment can help inform culturally sensitive interventions to improve the management of ADHD among AA children.}

abstract = {The success of new products depends greatly on customer satisfaction and meeting the customer needs is vital for new product development. By incorporating customer needs in the design and development process, organizations can improve productivity for their new products and reduce the risks associated with new product markets. Hence, design teams require methods to model customer satisfaction when setting the associated product design attributes. Thus, different approaches have been developed for modeling the relationship between customer satisfaction and product design parameters. In this study, 16 well-known fuzzy regression (FR) models are considered to understand the relationship between customer satisfaction and new product design. The design of FR models is based on the 4Ps marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion) concept in fuzzy environments. A flexible algorithm is then presented based on the index of confidence, error measures, and data envelopment analysis for selecting the best FR model. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated experimentally based on an actual case study, where the flexible algorithm is employed to predict customer satisfaction with a new product design in the freezer/refrigerator industry.}

abstract = {Hazard identification and prioritisation practices are very important for power plants to continue their operations without disruption. Systematic operational hazard analysis is not a very common practice at the Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) based power plants in Bangladesh. Hence, a structured hazard evaluation framework can greatly benefit them to ensure their operational safety. This study has been conducted to identify and prioritise the operational hazards of the HFO-based power plants through using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach in a fuzzy environment, and then, to explore the appropriate mitigation methods for the top-ranked hazards and to find the interrelationships that exist among the mitigation methods. First, the most common hazards in HFO-based power plants have been identified from the expert feedbacks. Then, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method has been used to determine the weights of the evaluation criteria and a fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) method, has been used for the final ranking of the potential hazards. Afterwards, mitigation methods for the top 25 hazards have been identified and interrelationship among those mitigation methods has been explored through using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and a matriced impacts croisés multiplication appliquée à un classement (MICMAC) analysis. The study finds that ‘explosion of high-pressure steam drum of the gas boiler’, ‘crankcase explosion and fire hazard due to oil pressure rise’ and ‘explosion of the compressed air reservoir’ are the top three hazards in the hazard ranking. ‘Standard operating procedure (SOP) and training’ have been found to be the most driving mitigation methods for the top-ranked hazards based on the ISM-MICMAC analysis. The findings of this study are expected to provide the managers of power plants with valuable insights, which can help them to prepare sustainable operational strategies to ensure the least hazardous work environment.}

The literature indicates several difficulties in obtaining success in the development of SPSS offers. These hardships indicate the need for well-structured methods supporting the systematic generation of sustainable innovations and solving contradictions during the stages of the servitization process. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is worldwide recognized by its potential to systematically solve contradictions and generate innovations. However, the research framework available and its application into SPSS domain· are still very limited. Thus, to address this gap, this paper aims to explore the contributions and challenges of the adoption of TRIZ in the development of SPSSs. A systematic literature review of the foundations and advances in this topic was conducted. The primary results indicate the main contributions from TRIZ to SPSS development, the types of eco-innovations resulting, the artifacts (e.g. models, methods, proposition or instantiation) that applied TRIZ towards SPSS and the most frequent category of PSS resulting according to TRIZ. Findings suggest that the systematic innovation proposed by TRIZ has great potential to enable the development of systematic SPSS offers. Synergies between TRIZ and the sustainable strategies of Cleaner Production also were mapped. Finally, our study proposes a research agenda and indicate the main challenges to apply the TRIZ in SPSS models. A new concept emerges in servitization field: the Systematic and Sustainable Product-Service Systems (SSPSS).}

However, the contribution of any technology to economic growth and environmental development is highly correlated with its extent of diffusion and adoption. While much has already been written about the EV ecosystem in the country and the electric market from a consumer standpoint, this paper analyses the supply-side challenges and opportunities in adapting to the electric mobility mission in India as perceived by the firms, especially the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Using PLS-SEM method on data collected from these firms in the Indian automotive industry, this study finds that major factors that the firms feel are significant in adapting to the current disruption are financial, technological and regulatory in nature. The factors aiding the transition are the state and central policies while inputs and trade related factors are impediments due to excessive dependence on imports for raw materials, components and final goods. The paper has further employed the lens of value chain analysis to understand the dispersion of these across the various segments of the EV value chain.}

abstract = {Product-Service Systems (PSS) have been recognized as potential game-changers for advancing sustainability. However, the sustainability of a PSS over traditional products and services is not automatic; it requires careful, intentional design. Despite a decade's progress in relevant literature, early-stage design assessment of a PSS – particularly from a life cycle standpoint and considering the social sustainability dimension – remains underexplored. This study introduces a framework for early-stage identification and analysis of potential environmental and social impacts within a PSS's life cycle to aid in decision-making and guide towards sustainable solutions. The framework's hotspot analysis, which combines life cycle assessment techniques, aims to pinpoint life cycle stages most susceptible to significant environmental and social impacts. Drawing on existing literature and expert evaluations, this approach offers designers preliminary insights into potential impacts, establishing a groundwork for comprehensive life cycle analysis once more detailed information on products, services, and organizational structures becomes available. The hotspot analysis not only addresses the lifecycle view of a PSS but also places emphasis on the oft-neglected social dimension of sustainability, marking an area ripe for further study. By supporting decision-making in the early design phase and encouraging scrutiny of various PSS concepts, this approach promotes the cultivation of sustainably-designed solutions.}

However, why certain tolerances are needed is often not transparent, especially in complex products with multi-disciplinary development teams. In those cases, tolerance synthesis and analysis get complicated which introduces ambiguities and difficulties for system-integrators and lead engineers for the objective decision making in terms of trade-offs but also in terms of an efficient computer aided functional tolerancing. Non-optimal tolerances yield potentials for cost improvements in manufacturing and more consistency of the functional performance of the product. In this contribution a framework is proposed to overcome the observed problems and increase the clarity, transparency and traceability of tolerances by analyzing the translation between the DPs and their influence on the final function.}

abstract = {The Suluova Basin is a prominent member of the wide transtensional Amasya Shear Zone located at the central part of the North Anatolian Shear Zone. This basin is crucial and provides well-resolved data to understand the evolution of transtensional tectonic zones as well as the morphological and paleoenvironmental changes of North Anatolia during the Quaternary. Analysis of detailed stratigraphical sections, faulting data, and mammal paleontology reveals that the Suluova Basin has started to evolve as a closed half-graben along the NW–SE-trending, SW-dipping basin bounding fault zone with normal slip in the early Quaternary. Initial sedimentation mode of the basin was dominated by alluvial fan facies associations. Progressive basin subsidence resulted in an expansion of a freshwater lake at the basin depocenter as faults propagated westwards. Further extensions in the basin were caused to initiate the E–W-trending southern tectonic boundary. Newly created accommodation space hosted a vast freshwater lake during the Calabrian (∼1.8–0.78 Ma) acting as a refugia for a rich faunal assemblage of large and small land mammals. The conditions prior to the onset of Middle Pleistocene (MIS19, ∼0.79 Ma) is marked with increasing regional erosion where paleo-Lake Suluova was captured by the regional river system. Synchronously, the next phase of the shear zone formation was introduced with E–W-trending dextral and NE–SW-trending sinistral strike-slip faults, cross-cutting the former basin structure, forming new depocenters. These faults are still active with noticeable seismic activity and comprise future risks for the major cities of the region.
Le bassin de Suluova est un élément important de la large zone de cisaillement en transtension d’Amasya située dans la partie centrale de la zone de cisaillement nord-anatolienne. Il s’agit d’un bassin d’importance cruciale qui fournit des données de bonne résolution pour comprendre l’évolution de zones tectoniques en transtension, ainsi que les changements morphologiques et paléoenvironnementaux de l’Anatolie septentrionale durant le Quaternaire. L’analyse de coupes stratigraphiques détaillées, de données sur les failles et de la paléontologie des mammifères révèle que la formation du bassin de Suluova a commencé par un demi-graben fermé le long de la faille bordière du bassin, d’orientation NO–SE, de pendage SO et de rejet normal, au début du Quaternaire. Le mode de sédimentation initial du bassin était dominé par des associations de faciès de cône alluvial. La subsidence graduelle du bassin a entraîné l’expansion d’un lac d’eau douce dans le centre de dépôt du bassin durant la propagation de failles vers l’ouest. La poursuite de l’extension dans le bassin a entraîné la formation de sa bordure tectonique sud d’orientation E–O. De l’espace nouvellement créé a accueilli un vaste lac d’eau douce durant le Calabrien (∼1,8–0,78 Ma) qui a servi de refuge à un riche assemblage de petits et grands mammifères terrestres. Les conditions qui précédaient le début du Pléistocène moyen (MIS19, ∼0,79 Ma) étaient caractérisées par une érosion régionale accrue durant laquelle le paléo-lac Suluova a été capturé dans le réseau fluvial régional. En même temps, la phase suivante de formation de la zone de cisaillement a débuté par des failles de décrochement dextres d’orientation E–O et senestres d’orientation NE–SO recoupant la structure antérieure du bassin et formant de nouveaux centres de dépôt. Ces failles sont toujours actives et sont caractérisées par une activité sismique perceptible qui pose un risque pour les grandes villes de la région. [Traduit par la Rédaction]}

This study presents a business model canvas framework for public transportation organizations including an impact element and its external environment. The main and sub-criteria of the model are designed according to the literature under three hierarchical levels. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (f-AHP) is applied to the model with two extensions which are Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS) and Spherical Fuzzy Sets (SFS) to evaluate the proposed model. A solution set is also provided with a traditional AHP in order to check the robustness of the former methods. According to the results, the internal environment is ranked as the most important criteria at the first level for all methods. Whereas the activity element is ranked first at the second level, key partners are ranked first at the third level for all methods. The results show that IF-AHP and SF-AHP provide similar global weights but both of them provided divergent results from traditional AHP weights. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is sensitive to expert judgments.

Industry demands solutions for interoperability between heterogeneous systems that can account for the necessary semantics in order to establish seamless, unambiguous information sharing of data from a product's cradle to its grave.

However, this paper considers that developing a digital twin can be very costly. Therefore, the approach focuses on supporting the decisions about the optimal mix of modules, and about whether a new digital twin module should be developed. The approach is applied to an industrial case derived from the collaboration with two space manufacturers. The results highlight how the design of the modular platform has an impact on the cost of the digital twin, if commonality and reusability aspects are considered. These results point at the cost-efficiency of applying a modular approach to digital twin creation, as a means to reuse the results from physical testing to validate new designs and their ranges of validity}

Understanding Six Sigma first requires providing a conceptual definition and identifying an underlying theory. In this paper we use the grounded theory approach and the scant literature available to propose an initial definition and theory of Six Sigma. Our research argues that although the tools and techniques in Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior approaches to quality management, it provides an organizational structure not previously seen. This emergent structure for quality management helps organizations more rigorously control process improvement activities, while at the same time creating a context that enables problem exploration between disparate organizational members. Although Six Sigma provides benefits over prior approaches to quality management, it also creates new challenges for researchers and practitioners.}

The objective of this study was to investigate the causes of uveitis in cats diagnosed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest between 2012 and 2015. Medical records were reviewed and cats were considered if complete diagnostic work-up, clinical examination and imaging studies were performed. All the feline cases were serologically tested for at least two of the common infectious causes: feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. Ninety-six cats with a mean age of 5.42 years, ranging from 1 month to 17 years old, with a male to female ratio of 1.33/1 were diagnosed with uveitis. The European domestic cat was overrepresented at 76% followed by Birman cat (6.3%), Persian cat (4.2%), Russian blue (4.2%), Norwegian cat (2%), British Short Hair (1%), Sphynx (1%) and Cornish Rex (1%). Infectious diseases were the cause of uveitis in 31 cases (32.3%), neoplasia was diagnosed in 22 cases (22.9%), uveitis secondary to septic keratitis in 8 cases (8.3%) and uveitis secondary to direct ocular trauma in 6 cases (6.3%). Twenty-nine cats (30.2%) with a mean age of 4.33 years old were diagnosed with idiopathic or immune-mediated uveitis, less than previously reported. Aqueous flare occurred in 91 cats and keratic precipitates were noted in 39 cats. The most common infectious cause of uveitis in this study was Toxoplasma gondii (n=18). Infectious diseases remain the most common cause of feline uveitis, therefore systemic evaluation and serological investigations should be performed in all cats with uveitis, cataract and glaucoma.}

abstract = {Supplier selection is one of the most important activities of purchasing departments. This importance is increased even more by new strategies in a supply chain. Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem in which criteria have different relative importance. In practice, for supplier selection problems, many input information are not known precisely. The fuzzy set theories can be employed due to the presence of vagueness and imprecision of information. A weighted max–min fuzzy model is developed to handle effectively the vagueness of input data and different weights of criteria in this problem. Due to this model, the achievement level of objective functions matches the relative importance of the objective functions. In this paper, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weights of criteria. The proposed model can help the decision maker (DM) to find out the appropriate order to each supplier, and allows the purchasing manager(s) to manage supply chain performance on cost, quality and service. The model is explained by an illustrative example.}

The query performances of pivot-based index algorithms can be significantly improved by properly choosing the set of pivots that is able to narrow down the database elements to only those relevant to a query. While many other approaches in the literature rely on empirical studies or intuitive observations and assumptions to achieve effective pivot strategies, this paper addresses the problem by using a formal mathematical approach. We conclude in our study that the optimal set of pivots in vector databases with Lp metrics is a set of uniformly distributed points on the surface of an n-sphere defined by these metrics. To make the study mathematically tractable, a uniform distribution of data in the database is assumed, allowing us to outline the problem from a purely geometrical point of view. Then, we present experimental results demonstrating the usefulness of our characterization when applied to real databases in the (Rn,Lp) metric space. Our technique is shown to outperform comparable techniques in the literature. However, we do not propose a new pivot-selection technique but rather experiments that are designed exclusively to show the usefulness of such a characterization.}

The notion of non-functional requirements (NFRs) is borrowed from software engineering, and a method developed in that field for linking NFRs to conceptual models is adapted and applied to business process modelling. Translated into this domain, NFRs are equated with the general or overall quality attributes of a business process, which, though essential aspects of any effective process, are not well captured in a functionally oriented process model. Using an example of a healthcare process (cancer registration in Jordan). We show how an analysis and evaluation of NFRs can be applied to a process model developed with role activity diagramming (RAD) to operationalise desirable quality features more explicitly in the model. This gives a useful extension to RAD and similar modelling methods, as well as providing a basis for business improvement.}

Feature engineering promotes features as first-class objects throughout the software life cycle and across the problem and solution domains. The goal of the paper is not to propose a specific new technique or technology. Rather, it aims at laying out some basic concepts and terminology that can be used as a foundation for developing a sound and complete framework for feature engineering. The paper discusses the impact that features have on different phases of the life cycle, provides some ideas on how these phases can be improved by fully exploiting the concept of feature, and suggests topics for a research agenda in feature engineering.}

Considering statistical data and analysis about the economic importance of small enterprises we can see, that they are numerous and create a notable part of the total value added in the non-financial business economy. This paper analysis in a first step the role and potential of small enterprises – especially in Italy – and shows then a preliminary study of the suitability of existing lean methods for the application in this type of organization. The research was combined with an industrial case study in a small enterprise to analyse the difficulties in the implementation stage and to identify the critical success factors. The results of this preliminary study should illustrate the existing hidden potential in small enterprises as well as a selection of suitable methods for productivity improvements.

It is impossible to achieve the best possible values for all process outputs simultaneously. For this reason, it is important to define what should be achieved from the process. Once the objectives are known, statistically designed experiments can be used effectively to determine the optimal levels of controllable process variables that will produce the desired result and make the process robust to variations in the influential parameters that cannot be controlled. This paper describes an approach to establishing values for process variables to consistently achieve the optimal set of process outputs. It is an iterative process that produces continuous improvement. Principlpes of statistical experimental design and multi-attribute desirability optimization methodology are employed. The benefits of this approach include better products, less variability, lower costs, and more efficient process definition.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing is a well-established end-of-life (EOL) strategy that promises significant savings in energy and carbon emissions. However, the current design practices are not remanufacturing-inclusive, i.e., the majority of products are designed for a single life cycle. As a result, potential products that can sustain multiple life cycles are deprived of additional benefits of being designed for remanufacturing, such as reduced material usage, lower cost, and improved environmental impact. Moreover, the uncertainty in design, material selection, and economics are not considered to produce remanufacturable designs. Accordingly, this research proposes a design for remanufacturing (DfRem) framework that accounts for design uncertainty and material price volatility. The framework systematically explores the design space, performs design optimization under uncertainty, followed by topology optimization to provide additional mass savings, and finally, a price volatility analysis for plausible design material choices. The candidate designs are evaluated based on their design mass, material price volatility, failure mode characteristics, carbon footprint, and embodied energy impacts. The proposed framework's utility is demonstrated via the use of an engine cylinder head case study subjected to thermo-mechanical loads along with fatigue and wear failure. Considering grey cast iron and aluminum alloy as the design material choices, it was found that the cast iron design reduced the initial design mass by 6% as opposed to a 5% decrease for aluminum. On the other hand, about 8% area of the cast iron design failed due to fatigue, compared to 3% for aluminum. We further observed that although the aluminum design provided better mechanical performance than the cast iron design, this material was more expensive and volatile in price.}

TRIZ is a product and process innovation method that uses various tools that propose paths to possible innovations and solutions. As such, TRIZ promises it could be a useful addition to the existing set of 37 maintenance guidelines. In this research the compatibility of TRIZ and maintenance guidelines is explored using a 3 stage research plan. Firstly, applicable guidelines are linked to TRIZ methods. In a second step these links are grouped and generalized so not every maintenance guideline also needs a unique TRIZ strategy. Finally a roadmap is presented that helps during Design for Maintenance activities in solving maintenance problems with the support of TRIZ tools.}

In this paper we argue that the engineering education design curriculum, through project-based learning, offers students the opportunities to experience engineering design the way it is practiced and simulated in industry. Data for the study constitutes analyses, using three categories: knowledge, skills, and values, of the students’ performance in a mechanical engineering product design course. Students were required to: Design a 21/2 axis Basic SCARA ROBOT (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) for a given application. A survey from graduate students working in industry shows that that project-based learning, enabled them to effectively function in an industrial atmosphere where designing products were the mainstay. In addition, a one-way ANOVA test shows that there were strong associations observed in the development of skills between: knowledge and skills (p = 0.001); and skills and values (p = 0.0008).}

Inspired by the paradox theory, the study advocates avoiding the contradictory elements and accepting the complementary elements between SSCM and Operational Performance. Accordingly, the study identifies various SSCM and operational performance elements followed by their evaluation to understand their complementary and contradictory nature. The study is conducted in two stages. First, the study constructs a list of SSCM features through exploratory factor analysis. Second, a unique decision framework of MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by Categorical-Based Evaluation Technique) and TODIM (Tomada de Decisión Inerativa Multicritero) methods is used to evaluate the SSCM features based on their impact on operational performance criteria. The proposed framework is validated in the context of the Indian Automobile Industry. The study results provide an empirically validated and prioritized list of SSCM features. In the list, the top-ranked features complement the operational performance criteria. In contrast, the lower-ranked features compromise the operational criteria, at least in the short term. Thus, this study reduces the skepticism around the adoption of SSCM by focusing on the top-ranked features of the list and avoiding the lower-ranked features during the early phases of SSCM adoption. Additionally, the study provides guidance to supply chain managers on achieving sustainability in a supply chain without compromising on its traditional goals. The results are of practical importance as supply chain managers may now choose to implement specific SSCM features that exhibit minimum negative impact on operational performance. Consequently, the study encourages an assertive adoption of SSCM even in developing countries.}

Sea ice mass balance, which is simply the net difference between ice grown and ice melted, is an important parameter that can connect changes in ice thickness to environmental forcings. Opportunities for long-term observations of sea ice mass balance have been greatly expanded by the use of autonomous ice mass balance buoys, which are able to resolve changes to local ice mass balance by measuring time series of snow depth and ice surface and bottom position. This paper presents the design for a newly improved Seasonal Ice Mass Balance buoy (referred to as SIMB-3) that was created to enhance the ability to monitor mass balance with design features that maximize reliability and survivability, reduce installation difficultly, and reduce cost. Operational advancements were also made to make the buoy easy to manufacture, ship worldwide, and assemble in the cold. A custom low-cost datalogger-controller was developed to operate the mass balance sensor package while allowing future expandability for use with non-standard instruments. Several test deployments were conducted in 2018, and the instrument demonstrated ability to successfully collect mass balance data in seasonal sea ice. Results from one of these test deployments in the Beaufort Sea during April 2018, are presented and discussed.}

Looking back to 1995, industry consortia decided that the next wafer size would be 300 mm and all major Si manufacturers started to invest in costly 300 mm pilot lines. Even during the recent recession, they poured millions of dollars into the development of the first dummy, mechanical, and furnace wafers. Now 5 years later the first prime wafers with 0.18 μm design rule quality are available and the recession is over — one pilot line of a leading IC manufacturer is already running, proving the readiness of equipment and silicon — several other pilot lines and first fabs are planned in Asia, the USA and in Europe. The first silicon is scheduled for 2000 and 2001 anticipating the use of the 0.13 μm design rule at least. Besides this technological challenge, key-device manufacturers have posed a second challenge to the Si manufacturing community: price parity per square centimeter silicon at a much faster rate than in previous diameter conversions. Now that the 300 mm conversion is revitalized, the goal is to achieve the same area factor at a fraction of the historical number. To achieve these challenging cost and capability goals at the right time, Si manufacturers have to do things differently — they have to shift many paradigms, regarding cost reduction, communication and technology, which is the topic of this paper.}

However, as these are a class 1 medical device, orthosis development is mainly based on companies’ empirical knowledge and this can often result in usage problems and consequently, in the most extreme cases, in the devices being abandoned. Additionally, since articular orthoses may enable a movement to be performed, this imposes additional development restrictions which should be considered during the conceptual design stage of product development. As there are limited design tools available for the conceptual design stage and existing design methods are not well adapted to the development of these demanding medical devices, the development of articular orthoses may lead to inaccurate and maladjusted concepts, ill-adapted to the user's needs, and consequently, a source of discomfort. The aim of the design method proposed here is to help the mechanical designer during the conceptual design stage by taking into account from the beginning of the development process the way articular orthoses are used in life situations and at significant moments. Additionally, based on the theory of mechanisms, concepts such as the number of components, degrees of freedom and degrees of hyperstatism can be considered. This provides an exhaustive list of possible concepts for the articular mechanism which are subsequently screened according to different criteria related to the specific limb anatomy and specific medical conditions of the user in order to optimize concept choice. On this basis, this study develops an exhaustive research method to reach a large number of possible articular mechanisms to perform the desired articular movement for a specific orthosis, also taking into account the specific human body part.}

To what extent does unconventional gas development lead to an increase in cancer incidence in heavily drilled Southwest Pennsylvania?

Ecological study.
Methods
Data for urinary bladder, thyroid and leukaemia were abstracted from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR). Cancer incidence among counties with high, moderate and minimal number of producing wells is compared before drilling activity and thereafter. Observed vs expected cases, standardized incidence ratio and 95% confidence intervals are presented. Data are presented by county, diagnosis and sex for the years 2000–2004, 2004–2008 and 2008–2012. The percent difference between the observed cases from 2000 to 2004 and 2008–2012 was calculated.
Results
The observed number of urinary bladder cases was higher than expected in both sexes in counties with shale gas activity. In counties with the fewest number of producing wells, the increase was essentially non-existent. The number of observed cases of thyroid cancer increased substantially among both sexes over the time period in all counties regardless of the number of wells drilled. The pattern for leukaemia was mixed among males and females and among the counties regardless of the extent of shale gas development activities.
Conclusion
Potential risk factors other than shale gas development must be taken into account to explain the higher than expected cancer cases in counties with and without shale gas wells before and during unconventional shale gas activity.}

Background
Six Sigma, a process-focused strategy and methodology for business improvement, can be used to improve care processes, eliminate waste, reduce costs, and enhance patient satisfaction.
Experience with Six Sigma in The Netherlands
Six Sigma was introduced in 2001 at the 384-bed Red Cross Hospital (Beverwijk). During the Green Belt training, every participant was required to participate in at least one Six Sigma project. The hospital’s total savings in 2004 amounted to $1.4million, for an average savings of $67,000 for each of the completed 21 projects.
Three Examples of Successful Projects
In one project, the team designed a new admission process for the operating rooms, resulting in an average starting time nine minutes earlier. This relatively minor improvement made it possible to operate on an additional 400 patients a year and to achieve a net savings of > $273,000. A second project reduced the number of patients receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics by switching to oral administration, yielding an annual savings, based on medication costs alone, of > $75,000. A third project reduced the length of stay in the delivery room from 11.9 to 3.4hours, yielding an annual savings of $68,000.
The “Ultimate Cure?”
Six Sigma, which entails involvement of health care workers; use of improvement tools (from industry); creation of trained project teams to tackle complex, often crossdepartmental processes; data analyses; and investment in quality improvement may prove the “ultimate cure” to the current cost, quality, and safety issues that challenge health care.}

This paper explores the impact of two energy finance policies combined with renewable energy subsidy (RES) on energy vulnerability under different carbon peaking scenarios. To this end, the total fossil energy and renewable energy consumption under different carbon peaking scenarios are calculated using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Then, the sector-level energy use rights are allocated through the game equity fixed cost allocation model which considers equity, game and efficiency principles. Combining the consumption thresholds of renewable energy, the impacts of energy finance policies on energy vulnerability under different carbon peaking scenarios are investigated using an energy finance CGE model. The main results are as follows. (1) In the long run, the earlier the peaking time, the lower the energy vulnerability. (2) Under each peaking scenario, no energy finance policy implemented can minimize energy vulnerability before carbon peaking. After the peaking year, the implementation of energy finance policies can reduce energy vulnerability more significantly. (3) Among the three types of policy coupling , energy finance policies combined with RES can minimize national energy vulnerability and buffer the impact of energy finance policies on GDP.}

The importance of Quality by Design (QbD) is being realized gradually, as it is gaining popularity among the generic companies. However, the major hurdle faced by these industries is the lack of common guidelines or format for performing a risk-based assessment of the manufacturing process. This article tries to highlight a possible sequential pathway for performing QbD with the help of a case study. The main focus of this article is on the usage of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) as a tool for risk assessment, which helps in the identification of critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) and later on becomes the unbiased input for the design of experiments (DoE). In this case study, the DoE was helpful in establishing a risk-based relationship between critical quality attributes (CQAs) and CMAs/CPPs. Finally, a control strategy was established for all of the CPPs and CMAs, which in turn gave rise to a robust process during commercialization. It is noteworthy that FMEA was used twice during the QbD: initially to identify the CPPs and CMAs and subsequently after DoE completion to ascertain whether the risk due to CPPs and CMAs had decreased.}

This paper proposes a technology opportunity analysis model based on text classification and patent analysis, and gives a solution to find the key points of technology improvement from the perspective of customer needs. The model mainly includes three steps: the first step is to make clear the customer demand information, use text classification method to classify the technical fields, and determine the key research fields; The second step is to use the patent analysis method to find out the related patents in the key research areas, and use the TOPSIS entropy method to calculate the relative fitness of patents, to find out the core patents with the best comprehensive quality; The third step is to extract the specific technical solutions based on the core patents to provide a theoretical basis for enterprises to improve technology and improve customer satisfaction. Bearing steel is selected as the empirical research object in this study, and the research proves the validity of the technology opportunity analysis model.}

These natural/cellulosic fibers are abundantly available in nature in the form agricultural wastes, for example sugarcane bagasse, cotton linter, rice husk, etc,. Natural fibers are now widely used in industries other than automobile due to the above stated advantages. The main impediments of using natural fibers are, 1) thermal stability, 2) compatibility issues and moderate interfacial interaction etc,. This review investigates the potential of cellulosic fiber based polymeric composites for automotive application. In particular, this review focuses on the effects of incorporating natural/cellulosic fibers on the performance of automotive body, anti-roll bar, bumper, leaf Spring, helical spring and gears. Another focus area for this paper was an extensive review on its best applications in the automotive sector, detailed information about the type of fiber and their use in the specific automotive sector is tabulated. It was found that cellulosic/natural fiber based polymeric composites can be an efficient alternative for man-made synthetic fibers in the automotive sectors.}

abstract = {Context
There is a significant number of requirements engineering (RE) tools with different features and prices. However, existing RE tool lists do not provide detailed information about the features of the tools that they catalogue. It would therefore be interesting for both practitioners and tool developers to be aware of the state-of-the-art as regards RE tools.
Objective
This paper presents the results of a survey answered by RE tool vendors. The purpose of the survey was to gain an insight into how current RE tools support the RE process by means of concrete capabilities, and to what degree.
Method
The ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009 is a framework for assessing RE tools’ capabilities. A 146-item questionnaire based principally on the features covered by this international guideline was sent to major tool vendors worldwide. A descriptive statistical study was then carried out to provide comparability, and bivariate correlation tests were also applied to measure the association between different variables. A sample of the tools was subjected to neutral assessment and an interrater reliability analysis was performed to ensure the reliability of the results.
Results
The 38 participants sent back their answers. Most tools are delivered under a proprietary license, and their licenses are not free. A growing number of them facilitate Web access. Moreover, requirements elicitation exemplifies the best supported category of features in this study, whereas requirements modeling and management are the most badly supported categories.
Conclusion
The RE process seems to be well covered by current RE tools, but there is still a certain margin for amelioration, principally with regard to requirements modeling, open data model and data integration features. These subjects represent areas for improvement for RE tool developers. Practitioners might also obtain useful ideas from the study to be taken into account when selecting an appropriate RE tool to be successfully applied to their work.}

abstract = {Driving a conventional gasoline vehicle is an important polluting factor that causes environmental degradation. In order to reduce dependence on gasoline and its related environmental effects, electric vehicles are emerging as an alternative to conventional gasoline vehicles. Electric vehicles are both economical and environmentally friendly vehicles that draw their energy from rechargeable batteries in the car, which have many benefits such as reduced carbon emissions or pollution, cost-effectiveness, and less noise. The most important drawback of these vehicles is the problems with recharging. One way to deal with this problem is to build charge stations for electric vehicles. A suitable charge station for electric vehicles should also be located in a very precise place to get the most out of electric vehicles. Therefore, in this paper, an MCDA approach based on GIS for optimal site selection of charge stations has been conducted. A simple Hierarchical Analysis Process (AHP) is used to select the optimal locations for electric vehicle charge stations. The proposed method is applied in Kish (an island in the south of Iran) as the study area. The genetic optimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem and is simulated in Matlab software. Using integrated modeling and mathematical optimization in a GIS operating system, the results showed that the proposed model can select suitable locations for charge stations for electric vehicles that can meet the demand for charging electric vehicles within a certain access distance. Also, the method of locating and determining the simultaneous capacity of solar sources and charge stations of electric vehicles and managing the charging process of vehicles in the network has been presented and suitable places for constructing charge stations of electric vehicles have been proposed.}

Children and adolescents are the most at-risk groups, often engaging in these challenges without fully understanding the consequences. Nevertheless, most existing research and reporting on SMCs are driven by specific cases or phenomena. Thus, we conducted a scoping literature review of 66 studies that capture the breadth of the research field. Our review provides several critical insights. First, we identify a pronounced absence of theoretical grounding in the current literature, which we attribute to a focus on single-case and exploratory studies that often lack prior theoretical reasoning. This results in scattered and inconsistent descriptions of SMCs. This underscores the urgency of establishing a unified definition and a robust conceptual framework to explain the varied nature of SMCs. Second, the existing research predominantly fixates on the negative aspects of SMCs, narrowing the scope of analysis and overlooking the diverse intents and potential positive outcomes of engaging with SMCs, especially for young individuals. We propose a consolidated conceptualization of SMCs, providing a unified definition that captures their multifaceted nature. We introduce a typology to evaluate various SMCs, their underlying intents, and potential consequences, underscoring the necessity of considering a spectrum of SMCs—spanning positive, neutral, and negative—to fully comprehend the potential benefits and risks associated with participation. Our work aims to lay a theoretical groundwork for future research and practical interventions.}

Using a national quality survey from 482 companies in Sweden, our analysis shows that for product organizations, internal quality practices influence customer satisfaction and business results primarily through an organization's customer orientation. For service organizations, both customer and process orientation impact customers directly, and employee management has a direct impact on business results. The research also supports the claim that organizations with a quality foundation are in a better position to adopt a customer orientation.}

It is important to assess the SoS meta-architecture concept to ensure that it satisfies all stakeholder needs and requirements in the early stages of development. There are numerous linguistic terms called key performance attributes (KPAs) that could be used to assess the different aspects of the architectures capabilities, however, too many KPAs could complicate the assessment. The initial population of suitable KPAs is reduced through non-derivative based optimization employed by a genetic algorithm (GA) that generates the ideal KPA candidates though optimal rank selection. A Mamdani-type rule based fuzzy inference system (MRBFIS) is then used to make a fuzzy assessment of the SoS meta-architecture concept using GA optimized and assessed KPAs as MRBFIS inputs. The MRBFIS is a beneficial addition to an architecture assessment because it enables a nonlinear output that allows a more dynamic and adjustable assessment. The integrated assessment method detailed in this paper utilizes the GA optimized KPAs and the MRBFIS to provide a valuable fuzzy assessment of SoS meta-architecture concepts to determine if the architecture is feasible and acceptable.}
