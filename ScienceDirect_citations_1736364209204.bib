abstract = {Software requirements selection is the engineering process in which the set of new requirements which will be included in the next release of a software product are chosen. This NP-hard problem is an important issue involving several contradictory objectives that have to be tackled by software companies when developing new releases of software packages. Software projects have to stick to a budget, but they also have to cover the highest number of customer requirements. Furthermore, in real instances of the problem, the requirements tackled suffer interactions and other restrictions which complicate the problem. In this paper, we use an adapted multi-objective version of the differential evolution (DE) evolutionary algorithm which has been successfully applied to several real instances of the problem. For doing this, the software requirements selection problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives: the total software development cost and the overall customer’s satisfaction, and with three interaction constraints. On the other hand, the original DE algorithm has been adapted to solve real instances of the problem generated from data provided by experts. Numerical experiments with case studies on software requirements selection have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiobjective proposal and the obtained results show that the developed algorithm performs better than other relevant algorithms previously published in the literature under a set of public datasets.}

abstract = {Background
Recommended for decades, the therapeutic value of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the resuscitation of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is controversial.
Purpose
To investigate the possible time-dependent outcomes associated with adrenaline administration by Emergency Medical Services personnel (EMS).
Methods
A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a near statewide cardiac resuscitation database between 1 January 2005 and 30 November 2013. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of the time interval between EMS dispatch and the initial dose of adrenaline on survival. The primary endpoints were survival to hospital discharge and favourable neurologic outcome.
Results
Data from 3469 patients with witnessed OHCA were analyzed. Their mean age was 66.3 years and 69% were male. An initially shockable rhythm was present in 41.8% of patients. Based on a multivariable logistic regression model with initial adrenaline administration time interval (AATI) from EMS dispatch as the covariate, survival was greatest when adrenaline was administered very early but decreased rapidly with increasing (AATI); odds ratio 0.94 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.92–0.97). The AATI had no significant effect on good neurological outcome (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.90–1.02).
Conclusions
In patients with OHCA, survival to hospital discharge was greater in those treated early with adrenaline by EMS especially in the subset of patients with a shockable rhythm. However survival rapidly decreased with increasing adrenaline administration time intervals (AATI).}

abstract = {In recent years factors that may influence firms’ decisions to adopt target costing have been presented in the literature. These studies generally argue that target costing adoption rates positively correlate with the intensity of competition and perceived environmental uncertainty. However, empirical support for this view is limited. This study argues that the adoption of target costing positively correlates with the intensity of competition, but negatively correlates with perceived environmental uncertainty. In addition, perceived environmental uncertainty moderates the adoption of target costing when the intensity of competition intensifies. Hypotheses are generated and tested using data provided by a web-based survey of Swedish manufacturing firms. The findings indicate that the adoption of target costing and the intensity of competition positively relate, although the effect reduces with an increase in perceived environmental uncertainty. There is no evidence of a direct relationship between perceived environmental uncertainty and the adoption of target costing. As a result, the findings partly conflict with the outcomes of earlier work. The article also discusses the implications for research and firm managers considering the adoption of target costing.}

abstract = {Low temperature direct wafer bonding was performed in medium vacuum (∼10−4mbar). Different loads were applied during bonding processes. In all cases, the bond strength is above 19MPa, which is high enough for practical applications. More interestingly, in contrast to the findings by others, we found that the applied load does play a very important role in wafer bonding, the higher the applied load, the lower the bond strength. In the case of zero applied load, the cracking during pull test occurred in the silicon wafer itself rather than at the bonding interface. The bonded wafers were examined by means of scanning acoustic microscope (SAM). It was found that both the bubble size and bubble number increase with an increase in applied load. This phenomenon is contributed to the applied load. High applied load keeps two wafer surfaces in tight contact. If there are any impurities trapped during bonding process, such as air and water molecules, the tight contact prevents them from escaping out of the bonding interfaces, which results in the low bond strength. The distinctness between results from other works and our experiment were explained from the different dominant mechanisms in different wafer bonding processes.}

For this study, the life cycle phase used is taken from1: design, development, manufacture, transport, construction, operation associated infrastructure, maintenance, repowering/life extension, decommissioning and waste treatment and recycling. Design and development phase relates to measures to be taken, rather than contain risk. Also related to waste treatment and recycling phase we have a few information about that contains risk. For these reason in this study these two phase is neglect. In this study we aimed at gain a prioritization of risks which exist during the life cycle of wind turbine. Prioritization of risk is very important in terms of to determine which steps should be taken further measures. For prioritization of risk is employed fuzzy AHP α-cut analysis method.}

Aimed at capturing such functional knowledge that can easily be applied to other domains, we developed an ontological framework to systematically describe it. It includes six kinds of knowledge about functionality, i.e. two types of functional models, two types of organization of generic knowledge, and two ontologies of functionality. This paper reports on the successful deployment of the framework in a production company. The Plant and Production Systems Engineering Division of Sumitomo Electric Industries has used our framework to share functional design knowledge on production systems since May, 2001. An empirical evaluation by Sumitomo's engineers was unanimously positive. They said that this framework enabled them to make implicit knowledge possessed by each designer explicit and to share it among team members. This paper discusses some successful use-cases in tasks such as a design review, a patent application, and solving a quality problem. We also discuss effects of our ontological framework as a consistent viewpoint for capturing implicit functional knowledge and as a conceptual interlingua among designers. The limitations of our framework are also discussed.}

Based on the experience garnered from these case studies the researchers have been able to generalize an approach they term Engustrial design that systematically merges industrial and engineering design. This paper explains this innovative approach by applying it to the design of a camera case enclosure and further argues that a new educational approach is required to help minimize such diverse designer mindsets.}

In this sense, an ecodesign tool integrating the criteria provided by three environmental evaluation methodologies, namely Ecological Footprint (EF), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA), has been constructed on the basis of fuzzy logic reasoning and features. This idea enabled the decision making at process and product level taking into account the values of the different indicators at a time. The relative importance of each of them has been established through the definition of membership functions as inputs to the fuzzy inference reasoning procedure in the case of a specific product. As a result, a Fuzzy EcoDesign Index (FEcoDI) was obtained. A well known case study was used to test the tool. Different packaging materials for a beverage bottle were considered to identify the most environmentally friendly option.}

Existing literature provides guidance for engaging stakeholders during the early stages of product design in high-income country contexts, but few studies have examined the effectiveness of these methods in low-income country contexts. This study evaluated three user requirements elicitation and prioritization methods including open-ended, clustering, and discrete choice. Ghanaian healthcare delivery stakeholders with varying types of expertise, years of experience, and from various types of healthcare facilities were recruited to allow for diversity of responses. Participants included physicians (n = 10), nurses/midwives (n = 16), biomedical technicians (n = 14), and public health officers (n = 7). A hypothetical mechanical device for managing and treating postpartum hemorrhage was chosen to characterize each method's ability to elicit and prioritize user requirements. The open-ended method captured general requirements of a design concept, yet resulted in predominantly generic requirements. The results from the open-ended method were used to inform the clustering and discrete choice methods. The clustering and discrete choice methods were useful for inferring in-depth user requirements and eliciting stakeholder priorities. The clustering method revealed that usability and affordability were high-priority requirements among all four stakeholder groups. An individual difference scaling analysis was performed using the clustering method outcomes, which indirectly identified ease-of-use, availability, and effectiveness as the priority user requirements categories. Stakeholders ranked ease-of-use as the highest-priority user requirement, followed by performance, cost, and place-of-origin requirements, using the discrete choice method. Given the significance of the ease-of-use requirement, an analytical framework based on sub-requirements was developed for quantifying stakeholder needs. Lastly, the relative merits of the three elicitation approaches and their implications for use with different stakeholder groups were examined.}

The approach utilizes Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP), Fuzzy modified TOPSIS or Fuzzy VIKOR and Brown–Gibson model for robot selection. FDM is used to select the list of important objective and subjective criteria based on the decision makers’ opinion. Fuzzy AHP method is then used to find out the weight of each criterion (both objective and subjective). Fuzzy modified TOPSIS or Fuzzy VIKOR method is then used to rank the alternatives based on objective and subjective factors. The rankings obtained are used to calculate the robot selection index based on Brown–Gibson model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study related to selection of robot for teaching purpose. It is found that the highest ranked alternative based on Fuzzy VIKOR is closest to the ideal solution.}

Zen has fostered such mental qualities as preference for self-reliance, the direct approach, and a willingness to work hard and to sacrifice comforts. Confucianism emphasizes learning and group harmony. Shintoism encourages the open acceptance of sensual gratification.

The survey found that most respondents are aware of the need to adopt a green lifestyle, but only a minority are willing to voluntarily adopt one. The awareness and level of participation are relatively higher for women, for married people, and for homemakers. The survey also found that environmental education in school plays an important role in promoting participation in a green lifestyle. Moreover, although respondents agree that regulation is necessary to enforce a green lifestyle, they do not favor economic penalties for nonparticipation. Thus, informing the public of the positive effects of adopting a green lifestyle is more effective than regulatory enforcement. Our findings support the conclusion that emphasis on factors related to health or economics are more effective than social factors in promoting the adoption of a green lifestyle among the public. The results can be used as basic data to establish strategies to motivate the adoption of a green lifestyle.}

abstract = {Although School Bus Transportation Services (SBTS) enhance safe and supervised travel that impacts educational outcomes, there is a growing service decline in some private schools in Ghana. Given the dearth of research on SBTS satisfaction in Africa's private schools, policymakers and education administrators are unable to find managerial solutions. This study investigates the determinants of school bus service satisfaction in the Sunyani Municipality, Ghana, using a survey of 403 schoolchildren and 40 staff members from twenty private schools. Multivariate analyses showed that the frequency of bus breakdowns is a critical determinant of ridership, whereas cost is insignificant. Satisfaction depends on bus service information, serviceability, drivers' empathy towards riders, safety/security, the physical appearance of crew and buses, and responsiveness/reliability of services. Notably, there is no transport policy or department regulating SBTS management in Ghana's private schools. Stakeholders can use the findings of this study to create a policy framework to improve the management of SBTS.}

Also, it is unclear which criteria should be taken into consideration primarily in the selection of chemical tanker ships. Therefore, choosing the most suitable ones for the cargo to be transported is an important problem for maritime companies. In this respect, the study aims to determine suitable chemical tanker ships for the four main cargo groups transported by them: animal and vegetable oils, corrosives (abrasives), organic chemicals, and petroleum products. A methodology that combines the fuzzy AHP, fuzzy TOPSIS, and clustering methods is used. 30 alternative chemical tanker ships are determined to represent the characteristics of all ships with a tonnage of 1–30 k DWT on the market. They are clustered into performance levels according to their fuzzy TOPSIS ranking scores. Consequently, a chemical tanker selection manual is developed based on the common characteristics of high-performance ships as well as the order of importance of criteria. It is envisaged that it would be a reference for ship operators and shipowners in the selection of suitable ships for the type of cargo.}

abstract = {A design process can be characterized by reflection-in-action; that is, the process consists of a series of problem solving activities and each is embodied with a problem and a solution. In this process, a designer represents a hypothetical concept on each design alternative, deploys and verifies the concept from multiple viewpoints considering other alternatives, and modifies it. An advanced integrated design environment should be based on a representation framework that embodies this process of reflection in concept development, which usually remains in the realm of the designer’s tacit knowledge. This paper proposes a knowledge representation framework for an integrated design environment, named DRIFT (Design Representation Integration Framework of Three layers), which interactively captures and manages reflection processes of generating and verifying design concepts. The core of DRIFT is a three-layered design process model of actions, operations, and argumentation. This model integrates various design tools and captures performed design activities. The action level captures the sequence of design operations. The model operation level captures the transition of design states, recording a design snapshot over design tools, which are integrated through ontology-based representation of design concepts. The argumentation level captures the process of defining problems and corresponding alternative solutions. Integration of three levels with a template of design operation extracted from Design-For-X approaches enables a proposed system to interactively and efficiently capture and manage the process of design concept development through operations over design tools. A design operation template works to limit the number of links between the three levels remaining easy to manage its semantics. This paper also demonstrates a prototype implementation of DRIFT and its application to conceptual design of a small mechatronic system with a system modeling method. The paper concludes with a discussion of some future issues.}

Some organizations have simplistic viewpoints or limited viewpoints for the potential of re-engineering. The author will provide re-engineering basics, tools and a workable methodology! Re-engineering achieves breakthrough business results through the rapid and radical redesign of critical core processes and the systems, policies, and organizational structures that support them. Programs like re-engineering are necessary because the business world is changing too fast for more traditional incremental improvement techniques to keep up. Breakthrough suggests that the results are completely beyond the realm of possibility now. Re-engineering is different from other improvement programs, such as reorganization, downsizing, or total quality management (TQM): while re-engineering addresses and improves certain critical core work processes, TQM fixes all work processes across the board; while re-engineering seeks single breakthrough improvements, quality programs such as TQM makes continuous incremental improvements; while re-engineering fixes the work, reorganization fixes the organization; while re-engineering fixes the work, downsizing fixes the firm's size. Re-engineering is not downsizing! Re-engineering differs from other improvement programs in several essential ways: re-engineering is not just ‘another’ quality improvement program; while quality programs seek incremental adjustments spread across the entire enterprise, re-engineering seeks breakthrough improvements based on a few ‘high-value’ processes through a radical redesign of those processes; in re-engineering, the employees become even more indispensable; re-engineering is not just restructuring. Restructing changes the way the firm is organized to do work. Re-engineering changes the organization of work.}

However, many firm’s product quality improvement efforts have failed to deliver anticipated business performance benefits. Implementation problems are generally viewed as significant factors in explaining such failures. Further, the literature suggests that firms’ views of product quality are often very different from those of their customers. However, to date this issue has received little empirical attention. The objective of this research was to examine the causes and performance outcomes of product quality alignment - differences between firms’ views of the product quality they deliver and customer views of the product quality delivered to them. We conducted exploratory interviews with quality and marketing managers aimed at developing a grounded understanding of the nature, antecedents and consequences of product quality alignment. These fieldwork insights were combined with the existing literature to delineate the central product quality alignment construct and develop specific hypotheses concerning the antecedents and performance consequences of product quality alignment at the SBU-level. Using data from a mail survey of multiple key informants (general managers, quality managers and marketing managers), we tested hypothesized relationships using a structural equation model methodology. Our quantitative findings provide empirical evidence that product quality alignment positively affects business unit performance. Our data also suggest that the degree to which quality goals spanning customer-focused and internally-oriented criteria influence decision-making and actions taken is positively associated with product quality alignment. Further, our data indicate that while the use of marketing tools in developing and executing product quality improvement efforts is positively associated with product quality alignment, no such association is observed with more commonly recommended TQM tools. Our results also suggest that effective interfunctional interactions between quality and marketing functions (higher levels of interfunctional connectedness and lower levels of interfunctional conflict) are positively associated with product quality alignment. Overall, our results suggest that product quality alignment is an important concept in understanding product quality improvement-performance linkages at the SBU level and that minimizing mis-alignment may be an appropriate focus for management attention.}

Careful evaluation in the earlier design stages must be performed before putting a PSS design solution into practice in order to guarantee the sustainability. Due to the reason that sustainability involves many factors and PSS is a complex system with long lifespan, the sustainability criteria will be of great quantity and various measurements. This paper aims to deal with two issues: (1) how to choose the sustainability criteria (2) and how to deal with uncertain factors when measuring these criteria. The zigzag mapping process is adopted to help decision makers to obtain criteria from the customer domain to function domain. The customer domain is modified to include the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. To deal with uncertain factors, the Information Axiom is extended in the hybrid uncertain environments characterized by fuzziness and randomness co-existing. The design range is modeled as a fuzzy variable and the system range is modeled as a random variable. Thus the information content calculating involves integrals with fuzzy boundaries. A fuzzy simulation algorithm is constructed to calculate this kind of integrals. Two case studies are illustrated to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method could reflect the judgements of decision makers more precisely, and make use of evaluation information more comprehensively. The results also show that use-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the social aspect of sustainability, while product-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the economic aspect of sustainability.}

Knowledge and communication are represented as antecedents of relationship quality and integration in a structural equations model (SEM). All relationships are posited to be positive, and we test whether they are moderated by (1) high versus low environmental uncertainty, and by (2) a high versus low rate of new product introduction as compared to competitors. In all cases but low uncertainty, the majority of structural paths are positive. Nevertheless, a strong, positive link exists between knowledge and integration in the low uncertainty case. Overall, we find that the more marketing knows about manufacturing and the more marketing is able to communicate credibly with manufacturing, better relationships and functional relationships will result with a variety of contingencies notwithstanding.}

To overcome these limitations and facilitate the spread of TRM technique, we focus on the TRM for R&D purposes, and propose a systematic process and detailed procedures with inputs/outputs for building TRM. We also attempt to integrate existing management tools with the TRM process. The proposed framework is applied to the R&D planning process of a government program managed by the Korea Industrial Technology Foundation.

Journal of Material Processing Technology, 122, 318–321). The benefits of this practice have been widely acknowledged in the industry. Several techniques fall under the umbrella of Design for Manufacturing, and their implementation depends heavily on the context in which they will be applied. How to enhance their use by designers is still an issue. The use of a formalized design process, in which a software application is used to bring manufacturing knowledge to the forefront, would improve DFM implementation. In such a context, a fundamental issue is to define the manufacturing information that should be presented to the designer. This work addresses the capture and documentation of essential DFM information to make design decisions. Essential manufacturing information is that which can affect the fulfilment of functional requirements and product constraints. The proposed approach combines DFM techniques and principles of Axiomatic Design (AD) theory. The manufacturing information is represented by the concepts of Process Property (PP) and process Execution Variable (EV). The ultimate aim of the approach is to define manufacturing knowledge structures and develop a knowledge-based application for DFM. The approach was applied to a case study in which a connecting rod was the part to de designed and manufactured. The manufacturing processes selected were forging and powder metallurgy. The DFM information about these manufacturing processes, related to the connecting rod, was identified and formalized in a table-based data structure.}

The proposed multicriteria decision-making framework brings a new perspective to real-time scheduling and part routing decisions, by implementing pairwise comparison of possible future states of a manufacturing system. The framework includes an extended finite state machine and a scheduler model to facilitate dynamic, short-term decision making. The scheduler model, which is developed on the basis of control theory, uses AHP to assess possible future states in a limited look-ahead horizon by comparing the performance measures of each state. The multicriteria decision-making framework developed in this study is implemented in a simulation environment to validate it for real-time manufacturing system control and investigate its performance under a range of look-ahead horizons. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework performs better for a mid-range horizon for most of the commonly used performance measures.}

abstract = {The paper is based on the authors' experiences in devising and conducting continuing education courses on Designing for Quality for design, development and manufacturing engineers in a large automotive company. Participants in the courses brought forward a wide range of quality problems encountered in their day-to-day professional activities. Methods for classifying and defining these problems are developed as a prelude to examination of the product development process and its management to fulfil quality objectives. The technique of quality function deployment which has recently received wide publicity in automotive engineering is investigated in the context of established design theory. Conclusions are drawn relating to the practice of engineering design in industry and the need for the effective dissemination of the work of design researchers.}

abstract = {Contrary to expectations, based on occurring changes in customer behaviours related to consuming and shopping triggered by the pandemic, the global container shipping market has continued to grow during COVID 19. Experts estimate that these increases will continue in the future due to changing consumption habits. However, container shipping companies (CSCs) may soon encounter many troubles and challenging situations. They have an extremely fragile structure and may be entirely unprotected when they encounter unexpected situations sourced from external factors. (i.e., due to grounding of a ship, complete blockage of the Suez channel for three weeks can be given as a clear example of that). Hence, selecting an appropriate container vessel type can help construct a healthier container shipping system less influenced by adverse conditions for decision-makers and practitioners. Besides, it can provide a more effective and productive maritime transportation environment for all stakeholders. However, selecting a proper container vessel type is a complicated decision-making problem since many conflicting criteria and complex ambiguities exist. The current paper proposes an extended version of the GRA technique with the help of type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy sets (T2NFN) for capturing and processing uncertainties better than the traditional MCDM frameworks. According to the obtained results, C6, container carrying capacity, is the most influential criterion and the type of post-Suezmax container vessel is the best option for the CSCs, as it provides advantages at a satisfactory level for almost all criteria than others. After the proposed model was applied, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to test the validity of the T2NFN GRA approach. The results of SA approve the applicability, effectivity, and robustness of the model.}

In this paper, a fuzzy approach enabling experts to use linguistic variables for evaluating two factors which are the parameters of matrix method is proposed to deal with shortcomings of a crisp risk score calculation and to decrease the inconsistency in decision making. The parameters likelihood and severity related to the hazards in an aluminum plate manufacturing plant are weighted by using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), then the orders of priority of 23 various hazard groups are determined by using Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. As a follow-up study of the case application, the proposed risk assessment methodology is applied for hazard types in each department of the plant. Depending on the hazard control hierarchy, control measures are overtaken for the hazards that are placed at first of intra-department rankings.}

The tool captures principles of eco-design for medical devices in a simple form, designed to be used by a team. This intervention tool provides designers and product marketers with insights on how to improve the design of their medical devices and specifically allows consideration of the complex trade-offs between decisions that influence different life-cycle stages. Through the tool, actionable insight is created that supports decisions to be made within the realm of design engineers and beyond.

abstract = {Background
It is unclear whether factors identified during the emergency department (ED) visit predict noncompliance with ED recommendations.
Study objective
We sought to determine predictors of adherence to medical recommendations after an ED visit.
Methods
We conducted a prospective, observational study at a single urban medical center. Eligible ED patients provided baseline demographic data as well as information regarding insurance status, whether they had a primary care physician (PCP), and the impact of cost of care on their ability to follow medical recommendations. Patients were contacted at least 1 week after the ED visit and answered questions regarding adherence to medical recommendations.
Results
Four hundred twenty-two patients agreed to participate in the study. At follow-up, 89.7% of patients reported that they had complied with recommendations made during the ED visit. Patients who were adherent to follow-up recommendations were more likely to have a primary care provider (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-6.1), have an annual income of greater than $35000 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.2), and report a non-Hispanic ethnicity or race (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-7.1). Individuals who reported that cost “sometimes” or “always” impacts their ability to follow their physician's recommendations were significantly less likely to comply with ED recommendations (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6).
Conclusion
Individuals who reported that cost affects their ability to follow their physician's recommendations and those who did not have a PCP were less likely to follow ED recommendations. Identification of predictors of noncompliance during the ED visit may aid in ensuring compliance with ED recommendations.}

abstract = {Although extant studies proposed various models and frameworks for sustainable supplier selection problems, they paid limited attention to the incorporation of regional economic, social, and environmental factors simultaneously for global supply chain design due to the difficulty in reflecting various dimensions of the global business environment and their associated risks in a decision model. Existing supplier selection models also tend to focus on the formulation of a simplified supply chain structure rather than considering more realistic supply chain operations under multiple sourcing and product designs. To facilitate the complex decision-making process of global supplier selection problems, this study proposes an integrated approach that consists of two phases to effectively reflect the multi-perspectives of global supply chain design for sustainability. The first phase identifies sustainable supplier regions through multi-attribute utility theory, considering four regional sustainability indices for economic and social factors in global business and logistics, to reflect the decision maker's risk attitudes on global business opportunities. In the second phase, a multi-objective integer linear programming model for multiple sourcing and multiple product designs that minimizes economic and environmental objectives is applied to find optimal suppliers and their order quantities in the regions selected from the first phase. The proposed approach is illustrated through a bicycle supplier selection case study. The results show that the multi-objective sustainable decision under a multiple sourcing strategy for different product designs leads to a supply chain that is significantly different from the single-objective non-sustainable decisions. The case study under different decision scenarios shows that a decision maker should hold a balanced perspective under the multi-objective decision environment for sustainable supply chain design.}

This situation is compounded by the lack of sound advice on integrating well-founded individual tools into a robust toolkit that has the necessary degree of flexibility such that they can be tailored for application to specific problems faced by individual organizations. As an initial stepping stone to offering a toolkit with empirically proven utility, this paper provides a conceptual foundation to the development of toolkits by outlining an underlying philosophical position based on observations from multiple research and commercial collaborations with industry. This stance is underpinned by a set of operationalized principles that can offer guidance to organizations when deciding upon the appropriate form, functions and features that should be embodied by any potential tool/toolkit. For example, a key objective of any tool is to aid decision-making and a core set of powerful, flexible, scaleable and modular tools should be sufficient to allow users to generate, explore, shape and implement possible solutions across a wide array of strategic issues. From our philosophical stance, the preferred mode of engagement is facilitated workshops with a participatory process that enables multiple perspectives and structures the conversation through visual representations in order to manage the cognitive load in the collaborative environment. The generic form of the tools should be configurable for the given context and utilized in a lightweight manner based on the premise of ‘start small and iterate fast’.}

But to implement the GLS program, it is indispensable to integrate individual Green, Lean, and Six Sigma approaches in unique GLS methodology. Moreover, there exists no GLS framework that can be applied irrespective of the size, type, and culture of the organization. So, the present work deals with the integration and development of the GLS framework. The integration of the GLS was proposed based on theoretical elements, and the framework was developed based on DMAIC approach. It has found that enablers, toolset, and implementation methods supplement the integration of GLS. The proposed framework provides a path for GLS implementation through an appropriate selection of the project. Besides, it has identified that unique GLS indices and toolset are required to estimate various sustainability measures and execute selected GLS projects. The present study will facilitate the organizations to have readiness for the implementation of a sustainable GLS approach through a detailed understanding of integration and GLS framework.}

The contribution of this paper is a systematic PCF model for all the activities across SSC. After the introduction of the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model, SSC activities are discussed one by one in detail. As the decisions made during the SSC network have extensive impacts on PCF, it is important to estimate PCF with SSC stage. This paper also proposed the detail calculation model for each stage of SSC, including plan, source, make, deliver, return, and enable stage. PCF in SSC of a water and fertilizer irrigation machine is given as an example to demonstrate the proposed methodology.}

During the problem-solving process, various real-time and historical quality data are often not fully used, yet these data are of high value. This paper provides a comprehensive quality data mining process and method, as well as an intelligent quality problem-solving system (IQPSS). First, based on original quality problem data, an ontology library is constructed using the ontology generating module (OGM). Second, based on the generated ontology and the textual data of the original quality problem, this study builds a quality problem-solving knowledge base (QPSKB) by employing relevant algorithms in the knowledge transformation module (KTM). The component and fault relational matrix mining (CFRMM) algorithm is designed to extract the relationship matrix between the components and faults. The semi-supervised classification algorithm based on the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) is used to classify the immediate measures, causes and long-term measures into the corresponding ontology and express the ontology as their knowledge. Furthermore, the binary tree-based support vector machine (SVM) approach is applied to classify the cause texts into the factors of Man, Machine, Material, Method, and Environment (4M1E), which are the five factors in a fishbone diagram. In particular, the digital fishbone diagram is a brand-new type of fishbone diagram that subverts the traditional method of fishbone diagram analysis through brainstorming. A pilot run of the IQPSS has been undertaken in an automotive manufacturing company to demonstrate how quality management employees obtain this knowledge by searching in the IQPSS. The results show that the IQPSS contributes appreciably to the quality problem-solving in the manufacturing industry.}

Thus, this paper aims to suggest the concept and process of a patent roadmap based on a technology roadmap and patterns of patent development. For this, first, ontology of technology is generated to structure the characteristics of technology based on the existing technology roadmap and then patents are collected from a patent database. Second, collected patents are grouped by similarities based on vectors of extracted keywords and grouping results are classified by TEMPEST. In this step, keywords extracted from the previous phase are matched with TEMPEST individually and patent groups are categorized in accordance with high relevance between representative keywords in patent groups and core keywords in each category of TEMPEST. Third, the patterns of patent development are identified for each patent group and categorized by two types – structural and temporal patterns. Consequently, extracted patterns serve as evidence of patent planning, and the patent roadmap is drawn with the technology layer composed of the technology roadmap and the patent layer that each group is mapped on. The proposed approach is illustrated by the case of the transparent AMOLED display. The patent roadmap will enable managers to establish patenting strategies in order to achieve a valuable core patent that has the potential to become a business model, yielding good returns in the long term.}

abstract = {Multinational companies deal with production processes in various countries by operating global production networks. These production processes are allocated to production plants with different levels of autonomy regarding strategic and operative decisions. Typically, each plant and the whole network are managed by one or more network managers who have to deal with a decision overload in their daily business. 50% of their decisions are made in less than 9 minutes and only a small amount of decision tasks are dealt with for more than one hour. To reduce this dilemma, it was found that the distribution of decision autonomy can be enhanced. It depends on the company’s strategy and complexity dimensions in global production networks. However, so far there is little evidence on how to better distribute decision autonomy in global production networks in detail. Furthermore, it is not transparent at what level of cetralism a global production network should be managed without cutting the capabilities of production plants. This paper presents a methodology, which examines relevant strategy dimensions and derives guidance on how to distribute decisions in global production networks. First, the network and production strategies of global production networks are classified. Second, relevant complexity dimensions and decisions are introduced. Third, the influence of the distribution of decision autonomy on strategy dimensions is quantified by an impact model. Furthermore, the effect of complexity on the distribution of decision autonomy is quantified by an impact model. Here, the integration of empirical data was used to validate the different influences. Finally, the ideal distribution of decision autonomy for specific production plants in the global production network is derived. The methodology is applied in an industrial use case to prove its practical impact.}

To structure this approach, an algorithm is proposed that, through patent analysis and word category identification, extracts information concerning product properties, which relate to trend phases. Allowing controlled and repeatable measurements of trends, this algorithm aims at reliably identifying the evolutionary potential and possible improvements to this product.}

In this study, a two-phase robot selection decision support system, namely ROBSEL, is developed to help the decision makers in their robot selection decisions. In development of ROBSEL, an independent set of criteria is obtained first and arranged in the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) decision hierarchy. In the first elimination phase of the decision support system, the user obtains the feasible set of robots by providing limited values for the 15 requirements. ROBSEL, then, uses FAHP decision hierarchy to rank the feasible robots in the second phase. ROBSEL is illustrated and tested and several critical issues in its practical usage are explored in the paper. The applications of ROBSEL show that ROBSEL is a useful, practical and easy to use robot selection tool and improves robot selection decisions in the companies.}

By contrast, there have been few articles on green supply chain management discussing both green supplier evaluation and order allocation. This study proposes a novel model that integrates the best–worst method (BWM), modified fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) to solve problems in green supplier selection and order allocation. We demonstrated the proposed method using actual data provided by an electronics company. The results indicate that this model can effectively evaluate the performance of green suppliers and can also optimize order allocation for qualified suppliers.}

Firstly, this paper has constructed a multi-period supplier dynamic preference model that takes into account environmental protection, to minimise the total cost and carbon emissions. Secondly, the Taguchi method is extended to the supplier selection problem in the field of quality engineering. The parameter optimisation process is then designed based on the Taguchi method, aiming to optimise the main key parameters that affect supplier selection and determine the optimisation level combinations upon which the model is solved. Finally, the model's feasibility and evolution are verified through examples of its application.

It is a very important steering opportunity for the continuing work and for environmentally driven demands that are to be addressed in the product development phase. The designers are said to have the key to sustainable product development through EcoDesign. Many tools have been developed in order to help them to achieve this objective. However, most tools are seldom used primarily because of a lack of sustainability oriented requirements in specifications for products. If there is no demand for improved environmental performance, then there is no need for EcoDesign tools. The lack of market demand for environmentally improved products is therefore, a crucial factor. In other words: It makes no sense to grab a screwdriver from your toolbox if you have a nail in your hand. On the other hand if you have a hammer in your hand you tend to see everything as nails! The hypothesis of this paper is that there is a strong need for a tool to facilitate the integration of reasonable environmental demands into the product development process. The presented tool, “The Ten Golden Rules,” can be helpful in this effort. A helpful tool must be well adapted to the task and therefore it is important that the individual product developer/designer can develop personal versions from the generic guidelines. The Ten Golden Rules provide such a possibility. They provide a common foundation, for all in the team, which can be used as a base and guidelines for development of situation specific product-design challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Decision-making for lung cancer treatment can be complex because it involves both provider recommendations based on the patient’s clinical condition and patient preferences. This study describes the relative importance of several considerations in lung cancer treatment from the patient’s perspective.
Methods
A conjoint preference experiment began by asking respondents to imagine that they had just been diagnosed with lung cancer. Respondents then chose among procedures that differed regarding treatment modalities, the potential for treatment-related complications, the likelihood of recurrence, provider case volume, and distance needed to travel for treatment. Conjoint analysis derived relative weights for these attributes.
Results
A total of 225 responses were analyzed. Respondents were most willing to accept minimally invasive operations for treatment of their hypothetical lung cancer, followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); they were least willing to accept thoracotomy. Treatment type and risk of recurrence were the most important attributes from the conjoint experiment (each with a relative weight of 0.23), followed by provider volume (relative weight of 0.21), risk of major complications (relative weight of 0.18), and distance needed to travel for treatment (relative weight of 0.15). Procedural and treatment preferences did not vary with demographics, self-reported health status, or familiarity with the procedures.
Conclusions
Survey respondents preferred minimally invasive operations over SBRT or thoracotomy for treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment modality and risk of cancer recurrence were the most important factors associated with treatment preferences. Provider experience outweighed the potential need to travel for lung cancer treatment.}

Subsequently, it quantifies the relationship among service properties, perceptual responses and usage intention through the data mining technique using a decision tree. A case of door-to-door delivery (D2DD) service is adopted to demonstrate that the proposed approach can incorporate the customers’ feelings into the process of service design or improvement and illustrate that the decision tree is suitable to be integrated with Kansei Engineering. The analytical results show the influence of a combination of different service properties (resp. perceptual responses) on a perceptual response (resp. usage intention). It is found that the combinations of crucial perceptual responses result in positive (resp. negative) usage intention and the property combinations result in these crucial perceptual responses. Accordingly, the D2DD service provider can improve or create its service based on the research findings.}

Studies show that BWM compared with other methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), leads to lower inconsistency of the results while reducing the number of required pairwise comparisons. MCDM methods such as BWM require accurate information. However, it often happens in practice that a level of uncertainty accompanies the information. The main aim of this paper is to address this problem and provide an integration of BWM and Z-numbers, namely ZBWM. Providing BWM with Z-numbers enables the BWM method to handle the uncertainty of information of a multi-criteria decision. Additionally, the capabilities of the proposed method in the process of utilizing the linguistic information dealing with big data are highlighted. The proposed method is examined to address a supplier development problem. By experimental results, we show that ZBWM results lower inconsistency when compared with BWM. A Z-number contains subjectivity in its fuzzy part, which can be addressed in future applications of ZBWM.}

This paper seeks to evaluate the viability of investing in radical schemes by analyzing the changes in their characteristics relative to mainstream products. Initially, a preliminary model for evaluating the market potential of radical schemes is established through the collection and analysis of existing case studies. Subsequently, for the schemes with high expected market potential in the preliminary evaluation, the value potential of the schemes is further examined through data envelopment analysis based on mining of competitive schemes from the patent database. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is validated through an evaluation of two illustrative cases.}

This is particularly true in medical device design, where additional consideration must be given for a much more complex user-base that can only be accessed on a limited basis. Given this inherent challenge, few projects exist that consider design domain concepts, such as aspects of a detailed design, a detailed view of various stakeholders and their capabilities, along with the user-needs simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel information model approach that combines a detailed model of design elements with a model of the design itself, customer requirements, and of the capabilities of the customer themselves. The information model is used to facilitate knowledge capture and automated reasoning across domains with a minimal set of rules by adopting a terminology that treats customer and design specific factors identically, thus enabling straightforward assessments. A uniqueness of this approach is that it systematically provides an integrated perspective on the key usability information that drive design decisions towards more universal or effective outcomes with the very design information impacted by the usability information. This can lead to cost-efficient optimal designs based on a direct inclusion of the needs of customers alongside those of business, marketing, and engineering requirements. Two case studies are presented to show the method’s potential as a more effective knowledge management tool with built-in automated inferences that provide design insight, as well as its overall effectiveness as a platform to develop and execute medical device design from a holistic perspective.}

Many manufacturers are today striving to offer a large number of value-added PSSs (Product-Service Systems). The increased number of PSS hinders potential buyers from effectively discovering the most suitable PSS to satisfy their personalized requirements. To accurately find the needed or wanted PSS with lower search costs, it is effective to recommend suitable PSS solutions to the right buyers. However, service, a component of PSS, brings more subjective and imprecise information in acquiring users' preferences due to e.g. their different experience and knowledge on services. Moreover, the interactions within user's preferences are often omitted in previous methods, which may lead to inaccurate recommendation results. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative method for PSS recommendation is developed. This method explicitly takes into account the environmental aspect of PSSs in question so that a method user can be guided to select an environmentally superior alternative. In addition, rough DEMATEL (Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) is proposed to manipulate the interactions of vague user preferences in multi-criteria weight determination. Furthermore, a rough collaborative filtering approach is developed to make PSS recommendation under vague environment. A case study of elevator PSS recommendation shows the feasibility and potentials of the proposed approach. Theoretically, the new method can produce more reasonable PSS recommendation results by considering the interdependencies between different recommendation criteria. In marketing practice, the method can suggest proposals of new offerings to customers in a proactive manner.}

abstract = {Determination of the design attribute settings of a new product is essential for maximizing customer satisfaction. A model is necessary to illustrate the relation between the design attributes and dimensions of customer satisfaction such as product performance, affection and quality. The model is commonly developed based on customer survey data collected from questionnaires or interviews which require a long deployment time; hence the developed model cannot completely reflect the current marketplace. In this paper, a framework is proposed based on online reviews in which past and current customer opinions are included to develop the model. The proposed framework overcomes the limitation of the aforementioned approaches in which the developed models are not up-to-date. Indeed, the proposed framework develops models based on machine learning technologies, namely genetic programming, which has better generalization capabilities than classical approaches, and has higher transparency capabilities than implicit modelling approaches. To further enhance the prediction capability, committee member selection is proposed. The proposed selection method improves the currently used selection method which trains several models and only selects the best one. The proposed selection method generates a hybrid model which integrates the predictions of the generated models. Each prediction is weighted by how likely the prediction is agreed by others. The proposed framework is implemented on electric hair dryer design of which online reviews in amazon.com are used. Experimental results show that models with more accurate prediction capabilities can be generated by the proposed framework.}

Over the next three decades mankind is expected to consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times current consumption. Social welfare and human wellbeing are threatened with the scarcity of natural resources; consequently, nations and their societies are also at risk of collapse. The readers of this special volume will find a compilation of scholarly research papers with real-life applications that take the challenge of proposing decision-making models and tools to address sustainability challenges in integrative ways. The main focus of this special volume is integration of sustainability dimensions (economic, social, environmental, ethical and time) into decision-support models and to identify pathways to achieve more sustainable societies. The majority of the research in this special volume, 74 percent, focuses on environmental and economic dimensions. Only 26 percent integrated social dimensions with them. Methodologically, a range of mathematical models and tools are presented to support prescriptive decision-making, with some descriptive models integrated, to support decision-makers in solving practical problems across a variety of industries and scenarios. The breadth and complexity of issues facing organizations and society requires innovative applications of these methodologies. The concerns cover a spectrum ranging from energy to solid waste management. A multitude of levels from broad-based policy concerns to strategic inter-organizational sustainable supply chain management and significantly, shop floor operational issues are also covered. The variety of problems and solutions exemplifies the potential for modelling and operations research for addressing some of our world's most pressing concerns.}

Recent implementation efforts revealed that CE alone can not lead to maximum benefits. Therefore Collaborative Engineering (CE II) is introduced, placing CE in a wider context. This wider context is not obtainable from recent publications, they only show one side of CE. This one sided view in the literature leads to sub-optimization and misinterpretation. Based on 200 recent publications, the development, goals, and dimensions of CE are outlined. Furthermore, implementation efforts, as well as a view to indicate the most likely future developments are presented.}

Semiconductor fabricators today must face an environment with multi-product types and multi-priority orders. Since semiconductor fabrication has a very complicated production process, the production planning of different products types and priority levels is an even more difficult task to experts. The objective of this study is to construct an analytical approach under a fuzzy subjective judgment environment, in which fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method with entropy weight is utilized to deal with uncertainty, to generate performance ranking of different priority mixes. The results provide guidance to experts in a fab regarding strategies for accepting orders with the consideration of manufacturing efficiency in the aspects of product, equipment efficiency and finance.}

The hand exploratory behavior of in-car interfaces has been studied aiming to minimize the mental overload of the driver when looking for radio functions. Also, the subjective and emotional values associated with the interface have been considered. However, the identification and translation of these needs into design specifications is problematic. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of these issues by studying the relationships between users' preferences and engineering parameters of in-car radio buttons and, on the other hand, the identification of the more important engineering parameters for a better definition of the in-car interface requirements. The research was done based on an empirical study and the analysis combined exploratory statistics of preference ratings and qualitative content analysis, with partial least squares regressions and artificial neural networks to link the preferences with the buttons’ engineering parameters.
Relevance to industry
This paper proposes a set of haptic engineering parameters for in-car interface buttons in order to help the manufacturers and their clients to better define interface requirements related to subjective needs of the user, and so, with a positive impact on product development costs and delays. The developed methodology can be also used in other products.}

abstract = {Fuzzy set theory has been used as an approach to deal with uncertainty in the supplier selection decision process. However, most studies limit applications of fuzzy set theory to outranking potential suppliers, not including a qualification stage in the decision process, in which non-compensatory types of decision rules can be used to reduce the set of potential suppliers. This paper presents a supplier selection decision method based on fuzzy inference that integrates both types of approaches: a non-compensatory rule for sorting in qualification stages and a compensatory rule for ranking in the final selection. Fuzzy inference rules model human reasoning and are embedded in the system, which is an advantage when compared to approaches that combine fuzzy set theory with multicriteria decision making methods. Fuzzy inference combined with a fuzzy rule-based classification method is used to categorize suppliers in qualification stages. Classes of supplier performance can be represented by linguistic terms, which allow decision makers to deal with subjectivity and to express qualification requirements in linguistic formats. Implementation of the proposed method and techniques were analyzed and discussed using an illustrative case. Three defuzzification operators were used in the final selection, yielding the same ranking. Factorial design was applied to test consistency and sensitivity of the inference rules. The findings reinforce the argument that including stages of qualification based on fuzzy inference and categorization makes this method especially useful for selecting from a large set of potential suppliers and also for first time purchase.}

abstract = {The selection of the new requirements which should be included in the development of the release of a software product is an important issue for software companies. This problem is known in the literature as the Next Release Problem (NRP). It is an NP-hard problem which simultaneously addresses two apparently contradictory objectives: the total cost of including the selected requirements in the next release of the software package, and the overall satisfaction of a set of customers who have different opinions about the priorities which should be given to the requirements, and also have different levels of importance within the company. Moreover, in the case of managing real instances of the problem, the proposed solutions have to satisfy certain interaction constraints which arise among some requirements. In this paper, the NRP is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem with two objectives (cost and satisfaction) and three constraints (types of interactions). A multiobjective swarm intelligence metaheuristic is proposed to solve two real instances generated from data provided by experts. Analysis of the results showed that the proposed algorithm can efficiently generate high quality solutions. These were evaluated by comparing them with different proposals (in terms of multiobjective metrics). The results generated by the present approach surpass those generated in other relevant work in the literature (e.g. our technique can obtain a HV of over 60% for the most complex dataset managed, while the other approaches published cannot obtain an HV of more than 40% for the same dataset).}

This represents a significant shift from traditional prescriptive designs that do not evaluate performance under realistic fire conditions. However, given the variability in fire exposure and structural response, it is unclear which input values should be used to ensure a high level of reliability for burnout calculations. This paper introduces a safety format for burnout resistance compatible with the Eurocode and its reliability principles. The format allows users to specify desired reliability levels and prescribes equations for determining design values for load effects and fire load density using predetermined sensitivity weights. A method for calculating default sensitivity weights is outlined, proposing tentative values: 0.65 for resistance effect, −0.40 for load effect, and −0.80 for fire load density, with a default coefficient of variation of 0.30 for resistance effect when case-specific information is lacking. The safety format's performance is verified through case studies of a concrete slab and a numerical evaluation of a steel column, showing satisfactory and conservatively assessed results. Inherent conservatism in the design format may, however, occasionally lead to the undue rejection of designs. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the safety format's conceptualization, default sensitivity weights, and the influence of the adopted compartment fire model.}

abstract = {A modular architecture is a strategic means to deliver external variety (to the customers) and internal commonality (to the manufacturing organization). A common view is that a module should be a physical and functional building block, with well-defined and standardized interfaces between modules, and that it should be chosen for company specific reasons. Existing methodologies, such as Modular Function Deployment with the Modular Indication Matrix (MIM) representation of identified company-specific module drivers, can be used to assist the task to identify modules. Other approaches, such as clustering of the Design Structure Matrix product representation, may be used to identify modules from a technical complexity point of view. A new methodology for product modularization that integrates technical complexity and company strategies is proposed in this paper. The core of the presented methodology is to adapt the component-DSM with MIM-strategies, before clustering this hybrid representation with the previously presented IGTA++ clustering algorithm. The proposed methodology is exemplified and logically verified with an industrial test rig modularization case. The modular test rig architecture chosen with the new methodology is shown to have 53% less complexity, as defined by Pugh, compared with the original architecture, and it could potentially reduce the risk of design mistakes, and reduce the development time by up to 70%. It is also estimated that it would be possible to reuse up to 57% of the modules, in future test rig redesign projects, which indicates potentially large savings in cost and development time.}

One of these SDGs, Goal #7, is about affordable and clean energy. Despite the importance, there are few tools that guide policy-makers in aligning their domestic policies with these SDGs. The paper addresses this research gap and introduces a numerical decision-support method for identifying the most suitable renewable energy source (RES). RES selection according to SDGs can be a challenge for decision makers. This article presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that is based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) term set. The decision criteria are weighed with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the most appropriate RES alternative is chosen with the HFL COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique. The value of the method is demonstrated on a case from Turkey, and a comparative analysis. This approach constitutes a novelty by proposing a numerical model for SDGs that combines AHP and COPRAS in a HFL environment with group decision-making for the first time. The method can help policy-makers in better structuring local energy policies with regard to global efforts in a developing country setting.}

abstract = {A second-generation fast Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm product shape multi-objective imagery optimization model based on degradation (DNSGA-II) strategy is proposed to make the product appearance optimization scheme meet the complex emotional needs of users for the product. First, the semantic differential method and K-Means cluster analysis are applied to extract the multi-objective imagery of users; then, the product multidimensional scale analysis is applied to classify the research objects, and again the reference samples are screened by the semantic differential method, and the samples are parametrized in two dimensions by using elliptic Fourier analysis; finally, the fuzzy dynamic evaluation function is used as the objective function of the algorithm, and the coordinates of key points of product contours Finally, with the fuzzy dynamic evaluation function as the objective function of the algorithm and the coordinates of key points of the product profile as the decision variables, the optimal product profile solution set is solved by DNSGA-Ⅱ. The validity of the model is verified by taking the optimization of the shape scheme of the hospital connection site as an example. For comparison with DNSGA-II, other multi-objective optimization algorithms are also presented. To evaluate the performance of each algorithm, the performance evaluation index values of the five multi-objective optimization algorithms are calculated in this paper. The results show that DNSGA-II is superior in improving individual diversity and has better overall performance.}

Today companies are striving for leanness in other functional areas such as product design and development. In this paper, we review the state of the art on lean design, and the appropriateness of two tools for lean design applications: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) and Axiomatic Design (AD). The literature review section reveals the need and scope for more research on lean design. We also enunciate how the lean design approach fits within the traditional product design and development process, and then evaluate TRIZ and AD for their contributions to leanness. Our evaluation reveals a close correlation between these tools and the lean design metrics. The paper concludes by proposing the use of a synergistic problem solving approach based on TRIZ and AD to increase efficiency and quality of the process while also helping to achieve lean design goals for a company.}

Old people are nowadays a growing and significant age group. Despite their specific needs, they are currently constrained to accept the mass footwear that they are offered. Because of their foot deformities, their biomechanical characteristics are different than the rest of the population, and constitute important indicators for a better understanding and analysis of their particular necessities. The research problem aimed at investigating the biomechanical parameters of the elderly people in Romania using the force platform. These measurements can then be translated into constructive parameters for customized footwear design. The research used a force platform hi-tech device to measure different biomechanical indicators of elderly people. The results indicate that the weight of the elderly women and with their health conditions are correlated with the ground force reaction components.}

This study uses the information processing perspective to investigate the impact of inter-/intra-functional technological learning (knowledge acquisition, information distribution, information interpretation and organizational memory) of 105 project teams on new product development (NPD) outcomes (project success, development speed and product entry timeliness) across nine MNCs. Of the four technological learning dimensions, only organizational memory did not possess a direct relationship with any NPD outcome dimensions. This study further contrasts the above impact across varying levels of project complexity. Information interpretation and organizational memory contribute to project success for low complexity projects. Conversely, for high complexity projects, development speed is contingent on organizational memory.}

However, this approach has not yet provided a means for comparing various potential project solutions quantitatively. Moreover, while geotechnical engineering has accumulated data in large quantities, the value of this historical data has not been exploited fully for the identification of useful analogies. To address these challenges, we proposed the characteristic tree analogy method and a key algorithm for calculating the similarity index between objects. On this basis, we developed a decision support system that makes comprehensive use of geotechnical engineering historical data. We applied the system successfully to the roadway support design for Liangjia coal mine. The results verified the applicability of the characteristic tree analogy method for realizing geotechnical engineering designs, making maximum use of historical data. This approach can be extended to other areas of geotechnical engineering that have large quantities historical data.}

abstract = {In lightweight design, developers are used to face the conflicting objectives of functional fulfillment, economic performance, and sustainability. Against this background, however, a clearly structured approach for the satisfied use of specific lightweight engineering methods within the product development is still missing. Thus, this contribution deals with the fundamental conception and first implementation of a systematic development methodology covering the disciplines of mechanics, electrics/electronics and software just like the focus on an integrated view on product, production and material aspects. To ensure an application-specific manifestation of the product development process for three exemplary use cases from small and medium-sized enterprises but also large corporations in the area of prosthetics, bike construction and plant engineering, the individually developed methods and tools are first generalized in order to make them adaptable to a wide variety of industries. As a result, one lightweight-specific method or tool (e.g., function mass analysis, “PPM solution correlator“ or “2D layout & weight drafting”) is introduced in more detail for all stages of the technically extended RFL(T)P approach derived from model-based systems engineering (MBSE).}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Most telemedicine solutions are proprietary and disease specific which cause a heterogeneous and silo-oriented system landscape with limited interoperability. Solving the interoperability problem would require a strong focus on data integration and standardization in telemedicine infrastructures. Our objective was to suggest a future-proof architecture, that consisted of small loose-coupled modules to allow flexible integration with new and existing services, and the use of international standards to allow high re-usability of modules, and interoperability in the health IT landscape.
Methods
We identified core features of our future-proof architecture as the following (1) To provide extended functionality the system should be designed as a core with modules. Database handling and implementation of security protocols are modules, to improve flexibility compared to other frameworks. (2) To ensure loosely coupled modules the system should implement an inversion of control mechanism. (3) A focus on ease of implementation requires the system should use HL7 FHIR (Fast Interoperable Health Resources) as the primary standard because it is based on web-technologies.
Results
We evaluated the feasibility of our architecture by developing an open source implementation of the system called ORDS. ORDS is written in TypeScript, and makes use of the Express Framework and HL7 FHIR DSTU2. The code is distributed on GitHub. All modules have been tested unit wise, but end-to-end testing awaits our first clinical example implementations.
Conclusions
Our study showed that highly adaptable and yet interoperable core frameworks for telemedicine can be designed and implemented. Future work includes implementation of a clinical use case and evaluation.}

abstract = {The cost of design, for most products, has shown itself to be a small part of the manufacturing cost and experience has shown that at least 70% of the cost of a manufactured part is decided at the design stage. This is therefore, the logical stage at which to invest more time and effort into getting the design right first time. With the development of computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacture (CAM), the time and cost analysis of a design has been improved immensely. During the design, the material and manufacturing process combinations will be chosen from those with which the product design team is most comfortable. As a result, the opportunity for major manufacturing improvements may be lost through the limited selection of manufacturing processes and associated materials in the early stage of product design. The aim of this research is to develop an expert system that is linked into a 3D design package, which will give an analysis of alternate methods of manufacture for producing the design. The methods used to develop the system will be database design, and expert system development, along with concurrent engineering (CE) methodology. This paper examines the steps involved in developing the system using the IDEF modelling techniques and highlights key CE methodologies.}
