abstract = {Social sustainability focuses on building a sustainable workplace that prioritizes the occupational health, safety, and overall well-being of workers. It is considered one of the three fundamental pillars of sustainability. Human centric cyber physical production system (CPPS) emphasizes the central role of humans in the smart manufacturing process that has become an essential requirement to enhance social sustainability. This paper proposes a human centric CPPS framework for enhanced social sustainability. The social needs/requirements are identified and categorized into various types. Similarly, functional and design requirements are categorized into different elements and sub-elements of CPPS. The findings are used to create a QFD (Quality Function Deployment) matrix that integrates social requirements with the functional and design requirements of modular CPPS elements. The present work will be significant in enhancing the management capabilities and performance of traditional manufacturing systems, while also meeting diverse social needs and requirements.}

Nevertheless, QFD was originally designed for other industrial sectors, and as such, certain adjustments are necessary for an effective application in the food sector. In this context, this study aims at demonstrating an application of QFD in the development of an organic product. There has been growing global demand for this type of product in recent years. This type of QFD application is not empirically consolidated in the literature. Thus, this study might be considered a pilot work. A QFD conceptual model consisting of four matrices was constructed to develop an organic fruit jelly. The main adaptation is in the first matrix, which includes the key players in the supply chain. As food’s ingredients have natural variations in composition, the interactions among the ingredients are to be considered. In addition, the influence of the production processes on the product’s functional properties and the effects of the supply chain on the ingredients ensure that this type of product development has different variables compared to other QFD applications for non-food products. Therefore, the conceptual model used in this study may serve in the development of other food products. This study asserts that the element of socio-environmental responsibility is essential for developing an organic product because this dimension comprised one-third of the relative weight of the planned quality.}

The fuzzy number applied to the QFD, i.e. FQFD, enables rating flexibility for the expert judgment to handle uncertainty. The Fuzzy Cognitive Network Process (FCNP) is used for the criteria weights/priorities evaluation. The Fuzzy Aggregative Grading Clustering (FAGC) classifies the weights/priorities as ordinal grades.

abstract = {Every model to characterise a real world process is affected by uncertainty. Selecting a suitable model is a vital aspect of engineering planning and design. Observation or input errors make the prediction of modelled responses more uncertain. By way of a recently developed attribution metric, this study is aimed at developing a method for analysing variability in model inputs together with model structure variability to quantify their relative contributions in typical hydrological modelling applications. The Quantile Flow Deviation (QFD) metric is used to assess these alternate sources of uncertainty. The Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) precipitation data for four different Australian catchments is used to analyse the impact of spatial rainfall variability on simulated streamflow variability via the QFD. The QFD metric attributes the variability in flow ensembles to uncertainty associated with the selection of a model structure and input time series. For the case study catchments, the relative contribution of input uncertainty due to rainfall is higher than that due to potential evapotranspiration, and overall input uncertainty is significant compared to model structure and parameter uncertainty. Overall, this study investigates the propagation of input uncertainty in a daily streamflow modelling scenario and demonstrates how input errors manifest across different streamflow magnitudes.}

This paper formalizes the conceptual design methodology in building a controller with the use of quality function deployment (QFD) as a design and an analysis tool. The controller design approach using QFD has been applied to the automated steel wall framing machine and to a 2-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) robotic arm, which can be readily extended to n-DOF robotic manipulators. The analysis and decoupling techniques for controller design presented in this paper differ from those used in traditional AD. QFD for controller design provides continuous transfer functions to represent relationships and mathematical decoupling that is easily implemented in software.}

abstract = {The growing global population and the need for sustainable energy due to nonrenewable resources necessitate innovative solutions to meet energy demands while minimizing environmental impacts. The cardinal motivation behind this research is to move towards efficient biomass resource management in order to overcome environmental uncertainty and ambiguity and mitigate adverse environmental impacts and climate change. The research literature and international experts’ opinions were reviewed to present the biomass EEEGOT model. This important study came up with three new methods: a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (CIF-SWARA) method for ranking challenges; a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (CIF-DEMATEL) method for picking the best challenges; and a Circular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (CIF-QFD) method to put environmental challenges in order of importance and deal with them. According to the weight evaluation results, the organizational dimension (0.188) and environmental dimension (0.177) had the highest weights. Thus, they are considered the major challenges that require immediate attention from managers, decision-makers, and stakeholders. Additionally, the findings of conceptual modeling (TISM) indicated that culture, leadership, governance policy, human resources, and regulatory barriers are the most fundamental components affecting other components. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical expansion of the research literature by proposing a model through a comprehensive approach to circular bioeconomy that can be used as a base by relevant decision-makers and researchers. However, to expand fuzzy science, three methods were developed in fuzzy logic. Therefore, since biomass management requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges facing it, their precise prioritization, and the use of smart strategies and solutions, this research provides insights, useful tools, and solutions for organizational and industrial managers, decision makers, and scholars. They can use these resources to investigate, prioritize, and overcome these challenges. On the other hand, the focus of this research is on ignoring the linear economy and applying the circular concept in order to achieve several goals, including sustainable development, energy security, effective climate change, and reduced levels of poverty due to its global implications.}

To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion. The results reveal that the three dominant suppliers, which provide the best response to the identified criteria, are providers of cloud service technology.}

Design-aid tools using optimization methods are efficient to address these issues but fail to encompass the whole life cycle of products and customer attractiveness aspects. This article describes an original method using CSP optimization and QFD to generate an optimized model of a product during the early design stages. Scores from the QFD matrix are used to weight the sub objectives of the optimization so that the solving is strongly dependent on the customers’ demands. As a consequence, the method allows a better integration of customer needs during the design process. To optimize multiple performances, the variables of the model are used to create impact functions corresponding to environmental impacts, costs, etc. of every life cycle phases of the product's parts. As a result, the optimized model is the one with the best performance scores while answering best the variety of customers’ needs. The methodology is applied to the design of an innovative inflatable dinghy. Results show that the use of QFD generates a fewer improvement of the environmental performance compared to an environmentally focused optimization (10% vs 18%) but it guarantees that the product will better meet customers’ needs. Hence, the product should more likely be accepted and purchased and have a positive impact on the performances of the whole market.}

Although customer satisfaction is an important goal in NPP, other goals must also be taken into account. The evaluation of QFD involves vagueness and imprecision and thus fuzzy approaches have been applied. This study considers the satisfaction of each customer requirement (CR) as the response variable and the fulfillment levels of the corresponding design requirements (DRs) as the explanatory variables. Each CR's satisfaction expression is formulated using the mathematical programing method. Experimental design and fuzzy sets are employed to collect the input–output data set based on the evaluated relationships between CRs and DRs and the correlations among DRs in QFD processes based on the QFD team's ability, experience, and knowledge. Considering three objectives, namely the maximum customer satisfaction, minimum incremental cost and minimum technical difficulty of DRs in NPP, an additive fuzzy goal programing model is proposed to obtain the optimal satisfaction under the preemptive priority structure of all goals. Furthermore, considering that customer satisfaction complies with Herzberg's two-factor theory, this study incorporates the concept of motivation and hygiene factors into the model, to modify the fulfillment levels of DRs to enhance customer satisfaction. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.}

However, there are challenges to use this tool to solve complex customer-oriented design problems because of the uncertain information regarding customer requirements, design requirements and alternatives’ performances. To address the inherent uncertainty of qualitative information in the framework of QFD, this paper incorporates the continuous interval-valued linguistic term set, a novel information representation model, to depict the complex linguistic evaluations of experts, and then introduces a novel QFD framework with complex linguistic evaluations. Such a QFD framework is constructed with three phases: the first step is to determine the importance degrees of customer requirements and additional requirements, which are important for product deployments, with the help of the best worst method; the second step is to determine the relative importance of design requirements; the third step is to calculate the interval weights of alternatives according to the uncertainty degrees of evaluations and the weights of design requirements. The inner-element correlations are considered in the whole procedure of the proposed QFD. The proposed method is applied to the aviation service development for Sichuan Airlines in China to illustrate its practicability. It is noted that this method can also be applied to various cases about product and service design.}

It was also aimed to seek high quality level of product and process characteristics for meeting the desirability of attributes and for health care. A fuzzy grey inference system was employed with the support of fuzzy quality function (QFD) deployment to interpret the qualitative and imprecise customer attributes. Fuzzy QFD is relatively a recent methodology offering a more in-depth analysis and investigation into the handling of customer requirements and engineering characteristics. The attributes then were defuzzified into quantitative values by amalgamating the knowledge of the customers and the product designers. Customer needs (CNs) are the voice of customers and tend to be linguistic naturally. In this study, fuzzy inference system (FIS) along with fuzzy QFD was employed to determine the desirability of edible oil by consumers. Fuzzy QFD is a powerful tool for improving product design and quality, and procuring a customer-driven quality system. The integrated framework based on FIS, fuzzy QFD and FGRM determined the CAs relations, and desirability level of edible oil by consumers. The findings are not only meaningful for customers, but also important for market position of product. The methodology significantly reduces the complexity of decision making and increase the production efficiency and overall competitiveness.}

abstract = {This paper contributes to improving the limitations of traditional failure mode and effect analysis. This paper proposes a novel risk assessment approach using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based quality function deployment (QFD) and VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOm-promisno Resenje) approach. QFD approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers handles the correlation among design requirements (DRs), correlation among customer requirements (CRs), relationship between CRs and DRs for each criterion occurrence, severity, and detection. Intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ensure an advantage to present more accurate and easier the judgments of the experts. This paper examines occupational accidents related failure modes in shipbuilding so that occupational accidents and failure modes mean CRs and DRs, respectively. QFD approach introduces an advantage to handle the relation between occupational accidents and failure modes. QFD approach defines the weights of DRs for each criterion. The weights of occurrence, severity, and detection are determined by using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to the judgments of experts. These weights are integrated in VIKOR approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The result of VIKOR approach presents the ranking of the occupational accidents related failure modes in shipbuilding. The highest risky failure mode in shipbuilding is defined as the lack of nets on ship scaffolds.}

These diverse data sources contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and potential improvement directions. By developing the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) house, we determine priority levels for effective problem-solving and enhancement. According to our results, users are eagerly anticipating new laws regulating the usage of e-scooters, such as optimizing speed limits, designating the usage of e-scooter infrastructure, and appointing dedicated parking places. Overall, this study serves as a valuable reference for the government in shaping future e-scooter legislation. By addressing the identified user expectations and incorporating these insights into regulatory frameworks, policymakers can facilitate the seamless integration of electric scooters into urban transportation systems.

The scope of the proposed design technology is to eliminate the drawbacks of traditional building design to ensure a smooth Integrated Building Design (IBD) among the project participants and a sustainable and customer oriented design solution. The validation of the technology has shown that, compared to the traditional design, it enables to decrease primary energy demand by 10 % with less design iterations to match the initial project requirements. The structured algorithm of the technology facilitated the communication between project groups. Nevertheless, the technology requires an additional team member – a design facilitator, which leads to additional expenses. The validation of the technology also highlighted that some limitations may appear due to the implementation of the Independence Axiom from AD. However, the technology is universal and can be easily adapted for different design areas outside of building design.}

The Decision Making Trial Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) was used to study the causality relationship between the defects, based on a designed questionnaire, to conclude the influencing and influenced distress. The results suggested that 59% of the sewer structural and operational defects were influencing ones. Besides, the existing state of the sewer pipelines was evaluated on a scale from 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Critical) by integrating the DEMATEL technique with the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method. The QFD-DEMATEL model was implemented on a case study to compare the model’s classifications of the pipelines’ states with the actual ones. Based on the comparison, the average accuracy and true negative rate (TNR) of the classifications were 74% and 79% respectively. Also, the average invalidity percentage (AIP) was 41.32%, causing the validity percentage to exceed 50%. The integrated approach keeps decision-makers informed about their sewer pipelines to prioritize pipelines rehabilitation. Thus, defective sewers are reduced and so are the exfiltration cases.}

To change this trend, it is important to develop systematic procedures for identifying suitable approaches for responding to these needs. The main objective of the research described in this article is to build a structured framework of an eventual empirical research for linking cyber security improvement actions in healthcare systems to their strategic improvement needs. The structured framework is based on Quality Function Deployment (QFD), initially a product oriented quality technique. The essence of the QFD method is to extract the customer needs or desires and then to translate them into measurable product quality characteristics and further processing. As by its structure this is a generic multi-purpose planning framework, its usage has been enhanced to include many other topics. Our conceptual model has a top-down structure with QFD sequential matrices. To propagate the improvement needs from the strategic level to the action level, two QFD oriented matrices are developed. The first matrix translates the strategic improvement needs of a healthcare system into prioritized information/cyber improvement needs. The second matrix prioritizes the actions for improving the information/cyber procedures.}

To estimate those important designs, referred to as participation-oriented designs in this study, a decision support model is developed based on quality function deployment (QFD). This model connects participation-oriented designs to solvers’ motives through the matched incentives, ensuring the estimated designs could activate solvers’ motives most. Specifically, the relations among these three aspects are represented by two house of quality (HoQ) models in which one links solver motives and incentives and the other connects the incentives and participation-oriented designs. Moreover, a combination of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), fuzzy Best-Worst method (BWM), and fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) is developed to handle information in these two HoQ models. Therein, the FDM is employed to screen and map solver motives, incentives, and participation-oriented designs. The fuzzy BWM is used to determine the relationship weights between solver motives and incentives and incentives and participation-oriented designs respectively. The fuzzy DEMATEL is employed to describe and calculate the inner dependencies of incentives and participation-oriented designs respectively. A case of the crowdsourcing platforms for graphic design contests is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model.}

A typical QFD analysis process involves a series of group decision-making (GDM) processes, such as determination of the importance of customer requirements (CRs), the relationship between CRs and engineering characteristics (ECs), and the correlation among ECs. Properly handling these GDM processes is essential because it will significantly affect the prioritization of ECs, the target value setting of ECs, and the following deployment phases of QFD. Due to different personal experiences and/or lack of sufficient knowledge and information, decision-makers who participate in the QFD analysis process tend to provide their opinions by using different types and multi-granularity linguistic information, which are inherently vague and imprecise. Unlike most of the previous studies, which excessively rely on fuzzy approaches, this study proposes an integrated linguistic-based GDM approach, which can compute with words directly and avoid the risk of loss of information, to cope with multiple types and multi-granularity linguistic assessments given by a group of decision-makers in QFD activity process. Finally, a numerical example is taken to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The linguistic-based approach can effectively manage the imprecise and vague input information in QFD and facilitate decision-making in product design and development.}

In the QFD, the design requirements (DRs) affecting the product performance are primarily identified, and product performance is improved to optimize customer needs (CNs). For product development, determining the fulfillment levels of design requirements (DRs) is crucial during QFD optimization. However, in real world applications, the values of DRs are often discrete instead of continuous. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model in which the discrete DRs values are considered. Therefore, in this paper, a new QFD optimization approach combining MILP model and Kano model is suggested to acquire the optimized solution from a limited number of alternative DRs, the values of which can be discrete. The proposed model can be used not only to optimize the product development but also in other applications of QFD such as quality management, planning, design, engineering and decision-making, on the condition that DR values are discrete. Additionally, the problem of lack of solutions in integer and linear programming in the QFD optimization is overcome. Finally, the model is illustrated through an example.}

However, some drawbacks in constructing ranking framework, rating KQCs/influence factors (IFs) and ranking KQCs are existed in these methods. To solve this problem, we develop a three-dimensional house of quality (HoQ) model-based interval-valued spherical fuzzy-ORESTE (IVSF-ORESTE) method to rank KQCs. First, the three-dimensional HoQ models which add meta-action units (MAUs) dimension are constructed to provide a ranking framework, and interval-valued spherical fuzzy sets (IVSFSs) are utilized to rate KQCs/IFs. Secondly, some new distance and weight distance measures based on the Dice and the Jaccard similarity are proposed to extend the traditional distance measure between IVSFSs. Furthermore, the IVSF-QFD method is used to calculate the importance degrees of IFs and the KQCs are ranked with the IVSF-ORESTE method. Finally, a real case vis-à-vis a NC rotary table is illustrated to explain the implementation process of the proposed method, and discussion results indicate that the proposed ranking method is rational and valid.}

In this study, fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD) is used as a tool to improve service quality in the passenger transportation industry. QFD enables firms to hear the voice of the customer appropriately and integrate it with the technical language in design processes. However, the nature of uncertainty and subjectivity in service delivery processes makes it difficult to employ QFD consistently. This study provides an empirical example of how FQFD could be appropriately used. ‘Employee’ and ‘tangibility of buses’ are the items from the hybrid views of both customers and service provider managers who require the most attention when differentiating a passenger transportation service from a rival's. The vital technical requirements relate to ‘employees’, ‘the features of buses’, and ‘error-free services’.}

Despite considerable research on novel exoskeleton technologies and the commercial availability of many hand exoskeletons, most hand exoskeletons can only perform motor training and assistance, rather than treatment or diagnosis of hand diseases. This limitation is also observed in other rehabilitation robots. Designing a rehabilitation robot for medical purposes necessitates the integration of existing technologies, tailored to the symptoms, clinical conditions, and management methods of the target disease. To facilitate such design, this study presents a design strategy for rehabilitation robots that assist in the therapy and assessment of specific diseases. The strategy first systematically gathers prior medical and engineering knowledge on the management of the target disease and clarifies comprehensive design requirements, including medical goals and user needs. Next, modified Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) methods are used to identify the core requirements and the optimal design scheme based on existing technical solutions. Lastly, the optimal design scheme is prototyped, tested, and refined iteratively until the product satisfies the design purpose. As an illustrative case study of this design strategy, the design of a hand exoskeleton for assessing hand spasticity is discussed. This strategy is adaptable for designing hand exoskeletons for other diseases or developing other types of rehabilitation robots, thereby extending the potential of rehabilitation robots in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.}

The principal tasks of the QFD acting process comprise describing and scoring customer requirements (CRs); determining design requirements (DRs), the relationship between CRs and DRs, the correlations among CRs, and the correlations among DRs. Finally, the DRs can be scored by these assessments in NPP. This study proposes various methods of scoring the requirements of current and potential customers to reflect the knowledge and preference differences among different customers regarding CRs. The CR scores provided by different customers can be assessed by using linguistic, numerical, and interval values, or can be assessed using linguistic label sets with different granularity. A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic computational approach is adopted to aggregate the CR importance scores obtained from customers by using various methods. In addition, to accurately rate the DRs, a modified relationship between CRs and DRs is proposed. The proposed HOQ construction model is practical because it prevents the loss of information during the QFD process for NPP. An example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.}

We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM. The results from our QFD analysis indicate that interoperability is the most important characteristic when designing a responsive smart factory, with the highest relative importance of 31% of the eight characteristics we studied.}

It is of great practical significance that a comprehensive and in-depth insight into charging stations’ customer requirements (CRs) to uncover their pain points and improvement measures. Therefore, this study develops a decision framework for improving EV charging service quality based on quality function deployment (QFD). First, CRs are extracted based on charging station online reviews and classified by the revised importance performance analysis (IPA) method to identify the charging service’s main highlights and pain points. Then, the process of achieving consensus among experts on evaluating the correlation between CRs and service design requirements (DRs) is considered as an evolutionary game of coalition, with a meritocratic Fermi rule considering affinities (MFA) being introduced. Finally, the importance of DRs is determined by combining the Shapley value and risk aversion theory. The results indicate that regulation and convenience are the main highlights of charging stations to satisfy EV users, while reliability and assurance are primary pain points. The charging station operators should prioritize their limited resources on providing efficient customer and maintenance services, installing charging stations with international standards, and regularly inspecting and updating charging infrastructures. This study is beneficial for charging station operators to understand what customers want and how to satisfy them.}

The purpose of the present study was to identify the customer requirements and engineering attribute expectations of an innovative product to which a Kano’s model and quality function deployment (QFD) analysis was applied. In order to accomplish the research, a new water filling machine design was used as the case study. This alternative machine was aimed at making life more convenient and to support people interested in small businesses, since a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) filling machine saved production costs. This research began by classifying the obtained answers from questionnaires into groups. We then conducted a statistical analysis on potential users. The number of elements of the customer requirements was 11 and the number of engineering attributes expected was 5. The customer requirements of the innovated automatic filling machine was quickly identified. The machine, therefore, was designed and evaluated according to the considerations and relationships between customer requirements and engineering characteristics, where the cost and the machining capacity were considered important factors in the analysis.}

In this study, a fuzzy MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) based QFD (quality function deployment) which integrates fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), with LIP (linear integer programming) is proposed to assist an enterprise in fulfilling collaborative product design and optimal selection of module mix when aiming at multi-segments. In particular, Fuzzy Delphi is adopted to gather marketing information from invited customers and their assessments of marketing requirements are pooled to reach a consensus; fuzzy DEMATEL is utilized to derive the priorities of technical attributes in a market-oriented manner; and LIP is used to maximize product capability with consideration of supplier’s budget constraints of manufacturing resources.

Moreover, there is a practical problem in implementing QFD as experts in specific fields are often rare and difficult to find. In order to resolve these issues, this study integrated interval grey numbers, QFD and TRIZ techniques to develop an improved grey quality function deployment (GQFD) method. GQFD can assist product developers in identifying important engineering characteristics and can provide suggestions for possible improvements in engineering characteristics.

It is a crucial step in QFD to derive the prioritization of design requirements (DRs) from CRs for a product. However, effective prioritization of DRs is seriously challenged due to two types of uncertainties: human subjective perception and customer heterogeneity. This paper tries to propose a novel two-stage group decision-making approach to simultaneously address the two types of uncertainties underlying QFD. The first stage is to determine the fuzzy preference relations of different DRs with respect to each customer based on the order-based semantics of linguistic information. The second stage is to determine the prioritization of DRs by synthesizing all customers’ fuzzy preference relations into an overall one by fuzzy majority. Two examples, a Chinese restaurant and a flexible manufacturing system, are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The restaurant example is also used to compare with three existing approaches. Implementation results show that the proposed approach can eliminate the burden of quantifying qualitative concepts and model customer heterogeneity and design team’s preference. Due to its easiness, our approach can reduce the cognitive burden of QFD planning team and give a practical convenience in QFD planning. Extensions to the proposed approach are also given to address application contexts involving a wider set of HOQ elements.}

This paper tries to serve as a guideline to find the ideal tool for a specific industrial application as well as to highlight the key criteria that an industry might consider. For this purpose, we propose a logical framework for MBSE tool selection, which is based on market research, the approaches of Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and decision matrix. As customers are at the center of any product, accordingly the needs of MBSE tool users are addressed within this research as the fundamental starting point. Market research and extensive discussions with MBSE tool vendors and academia show the current situation of MBSE tools. To compare the performance of the considered tools, a set of user needs is defined. QFD is performed to analyze the user needs with respect to evaluable technical properties. Subsequently each tool performance is assessed using a decision matrix. Through this process, a well-defined functional structure of MBSE tools is sketched, and in order to identify the properties of an ideal tool, all the attributes of different MBSE tools are mapped to a common platform. For the purpose of evaluation, we apply our proposed logical framework to select an exemplary MBSE tool for interdisciplinary application.}

In this study, a new QFD approach integrating picture fuzzy linguistic sets (PFLSs) and the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method is proposed for the determination of ranking order of ECs. The PFLSs are utilized to express the judgements of experts on the relationships among CRs and ECs. Then, the EDAS method is extended under picture fuzzy linguistic environment for the prioritization of the ECs identified in QFD. Moreover, a combined weighing method based on technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and maximum entropy theory is established to calculate the weights of experts objectively. Finally, a product-service system design is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed QFD approach. The result shows that the manufacturer should pay more attention to “Meantime before failure”, “Warning feature” and “Quality of product manual”. Feedback from domain experts indicates that the integrated approach being proposed in this paper is more suitable for assessing and prioritizing ECs in QFD.}

The process of selecting the optimal innovative product design to maximize customer satisfaction is full of uncertainty and fuzziness regarding to the users’ preferences, the relationships between CRs and DRs and the merits of product designs. This study proposes a multi-expert multi-criteria decision making method to solve the innovative product design selection problem by developing an enhanced QFD method combined with the complicated fuzzy linguistic representation model, the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), and the ranking method, ORESTE. Firstly, we propose a probability aggregation method to integrate the individuals’ subjective evaluations into group ones expressed as PLTSs. On this basis, we extend the QFD into the probabilistic linguistic context to get the DRs’ fuzzy weights. Then, based on a new distance measure between PLTSs, a probabilistic linguistic global preference score function and three kinds of probabilistic linguistic preference intensity formulas are proposed. Furthermore, we develop a PL-ORESTE method to obtain the preference, indifference and incomparability relations between the alternatives. For the facility of application, we develop the procedure of the QFD-based PL-ORESTE method. Given that the “shared cars” is a new industry appeared in Chinese market, we finally illustrate the applicability of the proposed method by a case study concerning the selection of innovative designs of Panda shared cars.}

This approach makes it possible for the proposed methods to be dynamic enough to deal with the data's volatility, complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. It is demonstrated that incorporating TVF-EMD to provide time-frequency analysis along DE-RVFL, and goal-oriented social media analytics boosts the performance of out-of-sample predictions statistically and compensates for the "warranty data maturation" effect.

Identification of key design factors that influence a product's remanufacturability is a big challenge in DfRem area because of difficulty in data collection. Because the failure mode is closely related to remanufacturing, a two-phase QFD model is proposed by extending the traditional quality function deployment (QFD) frame and reusing failure modes feedback from end-of-life (EOL) product. The comprehensive list of design factors of products is developed by literature review, which includes engineering characteristics and DfRem guidelines. For the fuzzy and imprecise information, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to determine the weight of customer requirements translated from failure modes. Furthermore, the key engineering characteristics and design guidelines are identified based on the two-stage QFD model gradually. In order to overcome the difficulty of vagueness and imprecision expression of linguistic variables in implementing the two-phase QFD model, the triangle fuzzy numbers are integrated. Finally, a case study of the automotive engine crankshaft validates the feasibility of the method proposed. The main contribution of the proposed method lies in finding the DfRem improvement direction accurately based on the failure modes.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The results of the development of a modified quality function deployment (QFD) method, obtained for the first time to improve the product quality planning process in the metal cutting of laser technologies confirming the dynamics of open innovation, are presented. When using new marketing technologies, the requirements of consumers are established; a factorial model of customer satisfaction was determined with after an assessment by expert methods, their wishes were transformed into indicators of product quality, and its concept was developed. Product quality is enhanced by optimizing project specifications. The method of functional cost analysis (FCA) was applied for the manufacturing processes, which made it possible to reduce the costs of their implementation. New methods of product quality control were applied. The developed planning process is described by a sequence diagram, an algorithm, and a responsibility matrix. The research used search methods including Internet resources required for open innovation, namely functional modeling methods (IDEF) and the method of advanced product quality planning (APQP). The results of the achieved advantages of open innovation (reduction in research and development costs, implementation of the principles of total quality management (TQM), customer orientation, process approach, improvement) are recommended for further application both at the enterprise and in the metalworking of mechanical engineering. The practical significance of the results of this work is the reduction in internal and external failures by 12%; reduction in time for new product development by 9%; reduction in costs for online resources by 11% and quality control during production by 7%; reduction in labor costs for process management by 25%; and the stability of the process, which improved by 25%.}

This paper describes how new digital services are designed for a component manufacturer in the context of a research project. The central enabler for the new digital services is the digital twin based on the asset administration shell (AAS) that makes the necessary data available. Existing approaches start from a standardized modeling form in order to design AAS submodels based on it. This paper is about the specification of functionalities for services as a basis for further modeling and, thus, also for AAS submodels. This paper results in a logically arranged set of methods that displays this approach. The essential steps are definition of the services’ basic functionalities, identification of the user groups for specific services, specification of user stories, and subsequent detailing and prioritization with the QFD method. The paper ends with an outlook on the ongoing research activities to define the application-specific AAS submodels.}

abstract = {One task that catering services for high-speed railways (CSHRs) must accomplish is to identify and evaluate potential service stations before the design phase of the distribution system. Fuzzy quality function deployment (F-QFD) is one approach for processing the evaluation scheme by translating the basic requirements described in vague terms into actionable alternatives. However, fuzzy importance ratings obtained using F-QFD might be misleading because the approach does not consider the random fluctuations of the fuzzy importance ratings. This paper first proposes a two-phase robust F-QFD process that is integrated with a robust analysis to consider how the QFD process can interact with both the fuzziness and the randomness found in real-world management. Two indicators that measure absolute and relative robustness are proposed. Second, following the mean-end-chain concept, this paper considers the close relationship between the two phases by developing a set of robustness-oriented fuzzy goal programming (RFGP) models to determine the locations of potential service stations. Two robustness indicators are introduced into the two-phase RFGP models to mitigate the adverse effect of random fluctuations. To address the fuzzy and binary variables in the model of phase 2, a hybrid cross-entropy method (HCEA) is developed. The overall framework is termed two-phase robust F-QFD based on the mean-end-chain (MEC) concept (R2-F-QFD-MEC). A series of computational experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness of the framework and the benefits of the robustness-oriented F-QFD. A case study regarding 33 potential service stations along the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed corridor is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method.}

Quality function deployment (QFD) ensures that green supplier assessment criteria are in accordance with the characteristics that purchased products ought to possess. The partitioned Bonferroni mean (PBM) operator assumes that all criteria are partitioned into several clusters, where criteria in the same clusters are interrelated, while criteria in different clusters are irrelevant, and it can be used to deal with GSS problems in which all criteria are partitioned into several clusters. Furthermore, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) can efficiently express vagueness and imprecision, and possess powerful processing abilities. In this paper, we propose a novel GSS method by combining QFD with the PBM operator in the context of IT2FSs. Firstly, we present the interval type-2 fuzzy PBM (IT2FPBM) operator and interval type-2 fuzzy weighted PBM (IT2FWPBM) operator, and discuss several of their properties. Thereafter, we transform the preference values of the importance degrees of customer needs (CNs) into those of technical criteria (TC) through the relationships between CNs and TC, based on QFD. Moreover, the criteria are partitioned on the basis of the literature review on GSS criteria. Finally, a bike-share case is used to illustrate the applicability of the presented method, and various comparisons are used to display the superiority of the presented method.}

To account for the policy environment, the MSP QFD utilizes a novel approach to stakeholder importance weights. This MSP QFD adds to the literature as it permits the analysis of the broad range of relevant national policies with regards to the development of advanced biofuels, as compared to more narrowly focused typical QFD applications.

By integrating the idea of grasping “the beginning” and “the end” into the process of mechanical design, this paper introduced a method called quality function deployment (QFD) and applied it to the mechanical design of subsea power devices to demonstrate and verify a robust design process with a clear direction and focused application of resources. Combined with the example of the mechanical design for the subsea power device, QFD was applied to analyse functional technical elements by establishing the house of quality (HoQ) models. And then, it was achieved a stable deployment and realization of the structural function for the subsea power device. Furthermore, for the key purpose of ensuring adequate structural strength and watertight reliability, this study selected suitable material, designed reasonable structures, and integrated finite element analysis technology to carry out mechanical simulations. Finally, the design of the mechanical structure for the subsea power device was robustly implemented.}

In previous studies, open innovation concept and open innovation tools in the world were examined. Then, an open innovation survey was conducted in top Turkish companies and the needs for open innovation were discussed with relevant stakeholders. Following detailed studies, an open innovation portal structure is designed using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method. QFD allows to “listen to the voice of customers” where the design characteristics of products/services and customer requirements are mainly detected. It is used in the systematic design phase to evaluate the requirements of relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to follow the product development process of QFD to assure systematic innovation that the stakeholders for open innovation are identified, stakeholder needs are fully elicited and the identified needs are satisfied by the design structure.The resulting portal design has been currently put into practice by an innovation management system software company which is funded by the Turkish Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology.}

AHP discriminates between competing options where interrelated objectives need to be met; AHP is based on straightforward mathematical formulations. QFD on the other side is a customer focused method that usually starts by collecting customer needs and tries to integrate these needs into the product. In this study, following classes of engineering materials are analyzed; forming grade Bake Harden-able steel (BH), Dual Phase steel (DP), High Strength Low Alloy Steel (HSLA), Martenistic steel, Aluminum 5xxx, 6xxx sheets, Magnesium sheets, Titanium sheets, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). The presented study showed that the different grades of steel gained the first ranks in the selection process for almost most of the BiW panels; however other alternatives could work in trade-off with cost and manufacturability.}

This study proposes a method, namely “Quantile Flow Deviation (QFD)”, for the attribution of forecast variability to different sources across different streamflow regimes. By using a quantile based metric, we can assess the change in uncertainty across individual percentiles, thereby allowing uncertainty to be expressed as a function of magnitude and time. As a result, one can address selective sources of uncertainty depending on whether low or high flows (say) are of interest. By way of a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for estimating the relative importance of model parameter identification, objective functions and model structures as sources of stream flow forecast uncertainty. We use FUSE (Framework for Understanding Structural Errors) to implement our methods, allowing selection of multiple different model structures. Cross-catchment comparison is done for two different catchments: Leaf River in Mississippi, USA and Bass River of Victoria, Australia. Two different approaches to parameter estimation are presented that demonstrate the statistic- one based on GLUE, the other one based on optimization. The results presented in this study suggest that the determination of the model structure with the design catchment should be given priority but that objective function selection with parameter identifiability can lead to significant variability in results. By examining the QFD across multiple flow quantiles, the ability of certain models and optimization routines to constrain variability for different flow conditions is demonstrated.}

Traditionally, QFD rates the design requirements (DRs) with respect to customer needs, and aggregates the ratings to get relative importance scores of DRs. An increasing number of studies stress on the need to incorporate additional factors, such as cost and environmental impact, while calculating the relative importance of DRs. However, there is a paucity of methodologies for deriving the relative importance of DRs when several additional factors are considered. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is suggested for the purpose. It is proved that the relative importance values computed by DEA coincide with traditional QFD calculations when only the ratings of DRs with respect to customer needs are considered, and when only one additional factor, namely cost, is considered. DEA provides a general framework facilitating QFD computations when more factors need to be considered. The calculations are explained using a step-by-step procedure and illustrations. The proposed QFD–DEA methodology is applied to the design of security fasteners for a Chinese company. Though traditional QFD calculations consider the ratings as cardinal numbers, DEA has the flexibility to treat the ratings as qualitative variables. This aspect is illustrated in a separate section.}

However, they have shortcomings, such as limited production and nocturnal ineffectiveness. The present study proposes several alternatives to address these issues using the conceptual design technique. The customer requirements were met using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method targeted during the design stage. An integrated AHP-TOPSIS was used to evaluate the design of alternatives considering seven criteria. This proposed method includes many factors, including system efficiency, cost, and ease of operation and maintenance. The three alternatives combine solar stills with adsorption desalination units. Two weighting methods were used, consistency-based ranking index for decision making (CRITIC) and Entropy, to evaluate the results' reliability. The findings showed that the most favorable alternative with CRITIC value of 0.975 and entropy of 0.988, combines a pyramid solar still and an evacuated tube solar collector.

The problem is what possible improvements of take-away water cup are and how to match voice of customer with technical description in order for improving the cup design. To this problem, there are several method use to get voice of customer through interviewing, analyze Quality function deployment (QFD) tool, design the product, and lastly fabricate the product by using rapid prototyping. QFD is one of the tools in concurrent engineering (CE). QFD is a system to deploy the voices of the customers in understanding their requirements into the appropriate technical requirements for each stage of product development and production. Based on the result and discussion after analyzing the QFD, it shows that customer really need to improve the cover of the cup by adding tip on the cover in order for easy to drink and make a hole for easy to mix between sugar or creamer with the hot coffee.}

abstract = {Background
The purpose of this study was to develop a diagnostic outcome instrument that has high reliability and low cost. The scale, called the Shoulder Fatigue Scale-30 Items (SFS-30) risk assessment, was used to determine the severity of patient neck and shoulder discomfort.
Methods
The quality function deployment (QFD) technique was used in designing and developing a simple medical diagnostic scale with high degree of accuracy.
Results
Research data can be used to divide the common causes of neck and shoulder discomfort into 6 core categories: occupation, cumulative, psychologic, diseases, diet, and sleep quality. The SFS-30 was validated by using a group of individuals who had been previously diagnosed with different levels of neck and shoulder symptoms. The SFS-30 assessment determined that 78.57% of the participants experienced a neck and shoulder discomfort level above the SFS-30 risk curve and required immediate medical attention.
Conclusion
The QFD technique can improve the accuracy and reliability of an assessment outcome instrument. This is mainly because the QFD technique is effective in prioritizing and assigning weight to the items in the scale. This research successfully developed a reliable risk assessment scale to diagnose neck and shoulder symptoms using QFD technique. This scale was proven to have high accuracy and closely represents reality.
Level of evidence
Level 4, case series with either posttest or pretest and posttest outcomes.}

SSCM structure is considered as a prerequisite for a sustainable success. Thus designing an effective SCM structure provides competitive advantages for the companies. In order to achieve an effective design of this structure, it is possible to apply quality function deployment (QFD) approach which is successfully applied as an effective product and system development tool. This study presents a decision framework where analytic network process (ANP) integrated QFD and zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) models are used in order to determine the design requirements which are more effective in achieving a sustainable supply chain (SSC). The first phase of the QFD is the house of quality (HOQ) which transforms customer requirements into product design requirements. In this study, after determining the sustainability requirements named customer requirements (CRs) and design requirements (DRs) of a SSC, ANP is employed to determine the importance levels in the HOQ considering the interrelationships among the DRs and CRs. Furthermore ZOGP approach is used to take into account different objectives of the problem. The proposed method is applied through a case study and obtained results are discussed.}

In this paper, a fuzzy three-stage integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to select the most qualified supplier. First, triple bottom line (TBL) is applied to establish the sustainable supplier criteria with respect to economic, environmental, and social aspects. Second, the performance of sustainable suppliers is evaluated using the proposed approach, which consists of three operational stages. The first stage aggregates decision makers' opinions. The second stage transforms the ratings from the customer's perspective to the designer's perspective. In this stage, the quality function deployment (QFD) integrated with interval-valued intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (IVITFNs) is used to address the ambiguity in human thought, and transform the customer needs (CNs) into engineering characteristics (ECs). The third stage prioritizes the alternatives according to ECs. The VITse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method integrated with IVITFNs is utilized to rank and select supplier(s). Finally, a case study of NEV battery suppliers' selection demonstrates the applicability and robustness of this proposed approach.}

The cause of such imbalance is that environmental protection is not included in the product design and research and design phase by enterprises. Through green quality function deployment, this study integrated life cycle analysis into green design during the product research and design process, and applied the fuzzy theory to reduce customers' subjective judgment in semantics. A research and design model for green design was developed. The fuzzy green quality function deployment showed that customers considerably concern about ‘whether toxic materials are used in mobile design and production (15%)’, ‘whether there is excessive energy consumption in the circuit design (14%)’, and ‘whether the design of the battery can affect the environment (12%)’. This study developed a product research and design tool that considers the environment, quality, cost, and customer demand. Using fuzzy theory and quality planning, this study determined the importance of product design in technical attributes. It is expected that limited corporate resources can be applied in the key technical factor, thus developing a product research and design model to balance economic development and environmental protection.}

With regard to the eco-issues, only the End-of-life phase is considered, while for product family issues we focus on the product variety issues. Literature shows that Modularity and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) are effective methods for eco-design and product family design. The main idea is to incorporate QFD with modularity. The eco-modular drivers are obtained from the extended-QFD analysis and life cycle modules for eco-product family are identified with a fuzzy clustering method and eco-product family are established with DV (degree of variety) which is calculated by the QFD method. A case study demonstrates and validates our method and the results show that QFD can help designer determine better eco-modular drivers and improve modular method to create more variety considering End-of-life issues.}

We incorporate the Kano model and quality function deployment (QFD) approach to quantify the complex associations between various resident needs and existing policies. Taking Chengdu City as a case study, resident surveys and policy reviews are conducted to construct the demand-policy linkage matrix and determine the importance of UEI tasks. Results reveal that, (1) flood control capacity is most prioritized by RED, followed by wetland area and less PM2.5, while cultural service demands rank lower; (2) Forest coverage, green space development, wetland construction and park construction emerge as priority UEI implementation tasks that can maximize fulfilling RED. This novel framework enables adaptive customization of UEI planning for different cities through configurable modeling. It provides a valuable decision support tool that enables optimizing or improving the prioritization of UEI implementation tasks based on residents' preferences. The research results have important reference value for the prioritization of UEI implementation tasks.}

The existing papers handle a simple multiplication operation to calculate the correlation among CRs and the correlation among DRs. This study proposes fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) approach to calculate these correlations so that FCM is a successful method to handle the interactions among criteria. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating QFD approach and fuzzy cognitive map approach. The weights of DRs are defined in the result of the proposed QFD approach. These weights are used to evaluate the dishwasher machine alternatives in intuitionistic fuzzy VIKOR method.

However, greater product complexity, increasing dynamic customer requirements and further decentralization of innovation teams undermine applicability of QFD in modern NPD. Modifying QFD methodology with a multi-issue negotiation mechanism promises to overcome these obstacles because this negotiation-based structure (i) enables QFD to define a large number of interdependent decision parameters while handling complicated design trade-offs, (ii) includes changing customer requirements in real-time rather than a cycle-time determined by length of the product development process, (iii) allows decentralized NPD teams to negotiate with each other and customers concurrently. This study presents a multi-issue negotiation based QFD methodology by using a recently developed mechanism for multi-issue negotiation (namely, Modified Even-Swaps) and illustrates strengths and weaknesses along with practical insights with a case study of the development of a washing machine. The QFD methodology proposed in this study provides new options to assess new product alternatives by allowing customer co-creation which is essential in complex and often tacit-knowledge dependent comparisons and also intrinsically helpful for fine-tuning dynamically evolving customer requirements. Moreover, it supports competition-based interactions of decentralized NPD teams.}

To mitigate environmental problems and develop sustainable modes of transport in India, the government is trying to boost the electric vehicle (EV) market by introducing policies and subsidies. However, despite all the efforts, the share of EVs on Indian roads is quite negligible. Understanding the potential barriers and improving customer requirements will significantly help to overcome the issues and increase EV sales in India. Therefore, this study aims to prioritize the most significant barriers to adopting EV and develop the relationship between customer requirements (CRs) and technical requirements (TRs) for EV adoption and rank the CRs and TRs. For this purpose, a direct interview-based questionnaire survey was conducted among customers visiting the EV showroom for an inquiry and test drive. The survey was conducted in Ahmedabad city, India, and 561 data were used for analysis. This study used the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method integrated with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. AHP was used to prioritize the most influential barriers for EV adoption. Further, QFD developed the relationship between CRs and TRs for EV adoption and ranked the CRs and TRs. This study finds that the limited availability of public charging stations is a major concern for EV adoption. The non-reliability of the vehicle for long trip travels, higher initial purchase price, higher charging time, higher waiting time at charging stations, limited-service provider to install charging stations for home-based charging, limited spare parts available in local markets, limited availability of local EV service centers, and mileage on a full charge are indicated the significant influence on EV adoption. In addition, competitor analysis was conducted between EV and ICEVs based on CRs to understand the reasons behind choosing ICEVs over EV. This study outcome will help EV manufacturers, policymakers, and transport planners better understand the user requirements for EV adoption.}

First, it proposes the use of a forecasting technique which is effective to model the dynamics of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based importance rating. This is owing to the fact that the AHP has been applied very extensively in the QFD and there is, unfortunately, almost no tool to model the dynamics. Second, it describes more comprehensively on how future uncertainty in the weights of customer needs may be estimated and transmitted to the design attributes. Third, it proposes the use a quantitative approach that takes into account the decision maker’s attitude towards risk to optimize the QFD decision making analysis. Finally, an example based on a real-world application of QFD is provided to show the practical applicability of the proposed methodology.}

Although the supplier selection problem has previously been investigated, an effective solution to consider the dynamics of Customer Needs (CNs) in finding the best supplier has not yet been proposed. Such a method takes into account customer needs as a determinant factor in finding the best supplier and considers possible changes in the priorities of customer needs as time passes. In this study a method integrating the analytic network process (ANP), quality function deployment (QFD), and a Markov chain is used to address the supplier selection problem. This proposed method utilizes a Markov chain to trace the changing-priorities of customer needs and find a pattern for them. The ANP–QFD method then connects this pattern to product requirements (PRs) and PRs to supplier qualifications. This combination develops a customer based supplier selection method. The best supplier is selected based on the changing-priorities of customer needs. Although the customer needs priorities keep changing, one supplier is selected as the best one. This study introduces an innovative customer based approach to select the best supplier that is independent of initial CNs.}

The five major input components of the QFD, which are laid in the House of Quality (HOQ), namely, the customer requirement, the technical attribute, the relationship matrix, the correlation matrix, and the benchmarking information, play a central role in determining the success of QFD team. Accurate numerical judgment representations are of high importance for the QFD team to fill in the values of each of those components. In this paper, a generic network model, based on Analytic Network Process (ANP) framework, will be proposed to systematically take into account the interrelationship between and within those components simultaneously and finally derive their relative contribution. In particular, with respect to a rapidly changing market, the incorporation of the new product development risk, the competitors’ benchmarking information, and the feedback information into the network model may be considered as a novel contribution in QFD literature. Not only does this network model improve the QFD results’ accuracy, but it also serves as a generalized model of the use of ANP in QFD with respect to the previous research. A simple illustrative example of the proposed network model will be provided to give some practical insights.}

abstract = {This study aims to propose a methodology for understanding the needs of passengers of the second-class cabins of high-speed rails (HSRs) in China. Addressing these needs is important to improve service quality and passenger satisfaction. We initially utilize the most important and also the first step of quality function deployment (QFD) to collect and organize data. Multiple methods, including scene deployment/gemba, social media analysis, and critical incident approach, are used to collect the voice of the customer (VOC). With aid of the VOC table (VOCT), the collected VOC is interpreted from passengers’ perspective and deployed as need items, which are grouped into passenger needs using the technique of affinity diagramming. To determine which of the passenger needs are important, we present the need items in a questionnaire in the form of pairwise comparison to obtain the opinion of frequent passengers. The collected responses are processed with the interval-valued analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to obtain the relative importance of the needs. Comfortable seat, sensory comfort, and proper luggage storage are identified as the major concerns of passengers. The obtained results should serve as valuable reference for planning and improving the design of cabin interiors and the quality of passenger service of HSRs in China. The study also provides a method for understanding customers’ needs related to the infrastructure and facilities of rails and those of other modes of public transportation.}

abstract = {The growing problem of bridge deterioration globally has imposed prominent challenges on transportation agencies, mainly in terms of ensuring safety and serviceability of the bridge infrastructure. The large number of bridges built during the 20th century has aged and produced a complex decision-making problem that departments of transportation need to deal with. Bridge management, as a particular domain of infrastructure asset management, has focused on developing methods for condition rating and deterioration modeling. The current research reviews bridge inspection practices and identifies the main defects and deterioration signs of concrete bridge decks that are typically captured by Visual Inspection (VI) and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques. The research introduces the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) theory and Weibull Distribution Function (WDF) as an integrated novel method to the area of bridge condition assessment and deterioration modeling. The proposed QFD condition assessment model is developed based on integrating VI and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) evaluation results to provide consistent condition ratings and performance predictions. The QFD model is demonstrated with a real case study and compared to other condition assessment models. Moreover, the QFD method is validated with data extracted from twenty bridge inspection reports completed by bridge inspectors and assessed by bridge experts. The developed deterioration curves using the reliability function for the Weibull distribution show absolute matching in these results through predicting the structure future performance and defining its useful service life. Accordingly, these models can enhance bridge Maintenance, Repair and Replacement (MRR) decisions since they produce reliable condition ratings and predictions that can link to proper rehabilitation action, and eventually assist in the decision making and planning for the selected MRR action. All these processes are integrated within one framework.}

To minimize adverse environmental impacts, industrial waste can be effectively managed through implementingsmart technologies. The present study aimed to identify the challenges of industrial waste management and propose smart solutions to effectively manage these challenges. The findings derived from a systematic literature review indicate that the challenges of industrial waste management can be classified into five dimensions within the STEEGO model. By evaluating the weights of each dimension using the HF-BWM method, the “organizational” dimension, with a weight of 0.27, was found to be the severest challenge, while the “technological” dimension, with a weight of 0.347, was considered to be the most probable challenge. Furthermore, the findings from conceptual modeling, using the TISM method, show that the primary challenges in industrial waste management include: “a lack of culture for effective waste management”, “insufficient training on legal waste drainage and proper waste digestion”, and “a lack of specific technical instructions for refining and recycling." To overcome these challenges, smart solutions have been proposed. The result of the HF-QFD method indicate that the most important solution is “constructing smart infrastructure for proper waste management”, with a score of 0.27. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical development of the model for the challenges of industrial waste management by applying the “organizational” dimension, considering both biological and physical aspects in the “environmental” dimension, identifying smart solutions to overcome the challenges for cleaner industrial waste systems, as well as using smart industrial waste management technologies in different industries. Our results emphasize that, given the type of waste, industry managers should employ specific smart technologies for disposing and recycling industrial waste. This approach can prevent the loss of raw materials and protect the environment from various types of waste.}

Within this context, the customer and technical requirements for energy investment policies are evaluated by considering the fuzzy decision matrix in the first process of the QFD and then, the technical requirements are used to rank the new service/product process of the energy investments in the second process of QFD. The balanced scorecard perspectives and the key factors are defined to rank the European energy investment policies respectively. Accordingly, the possible priorities of the European energy investment policies are discussed to conduct the most remarkable and efficient energy operations and the relevant results to contribute the improvement of energy sector are highlighted.}

To reduce or prevent occupational hazards in the construction industry, a fuzzy risk assessment method was proposed to provide a prevention and improvement technique against occupational hazards. This method used two-stage quality function deployment (QFD) tables to represent the relationships among construction items, hazard types and hazard causes. A fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) method was developed to identify important hazard types and hazard causes. Failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) was performed to assess the risk value of hazard causes based on the fuzzy inference approach. The proposed method was applied to a telecom engineering company in southern Taiwan. The performance evaluation result indicated that this method can provide satisfactory risk assessment values of hazard causes and relevant improvement strategies.}

This study presents a rough set-based approach used to estimate the correlation measures by revealing the knowledge of a QFD team. The approach involves introducing the category factor of a correlation to express the influences of the correlation categories on the corresponding correlation measures. A case study of a two-cylinder washing machine is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

However, the complex and imprecise factors in QFD present many difficulties for the analysis process of ranking ECs. Even though different techniques have been applied to determine the importance of ECs, they do not fully express all the preferences involved, which could affect the preciseness of results. To address the vague information at the early stage of product development effectively, this paper presents a group multi-granular linguistic-based approach to enable customers or developers to express their preferences using different linguistic label sets. Using different linguistic label sets although makes the process more complicated, it is more meaningful and more practical. Apparently, the proposed method may not only reflect the vague information effectively, but also avoid the risk of information loss. The proposed approach uses a two-phase framework to determine the priority of CRs and evaluate the priority of ECs. A case example is given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method. The proposed approach is superior to the existing approach in terms of robustness.}

Mobility hub centers are centrally located that enable people to go where they want to go without a private vehicle by combining many options such as walking, public transportation, bike sharing and car sharing. A well-designed mobility hub reduces GHG emissions by reducing vehicle miles within the city and provides accessible space for transferring of passengers from one mode of transport to another. To fulfill these aims, mobility hubs must be in the center and technologically well designed so that all individuals in the society can easily access it. Mobility hubs should also be able to increase or improve the mobility of passengers, and in turn ensure the satisfaction of all citizens. Due to the importance of passenger requirements (PRs) and sustainable design requirements (SDRs), to satisfy PRs while designing a mobility hub, in this study, a Fermatean Fuzzy based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology is developed and applied to determine PRs and SDRs to satisfy PRs while designing a mobility hub in Kadikoy/Istanbul. As a relatively new extension of fuzzy sets, Fermatean Fuzzy Set (FFS) is used, in this study, for judgements to model fuzziness and uncertainty more extensively. According to results, the most important SDR to design mobility hub is “Mobility as a service (MaaS)” while the second and third most important SDRs are “Increase smartphone connectivity to create awareness of multi-modal options” and “Increase green spaces in the terminal”. This study’s results can support authorities in making strategic decisions in favor of future mobility hub designs.}

This study employed Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques for the assessment of risks. The criteria for risk evaluation were gauged through Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) and Fuzzy VIKOR approach was used for ranking these risks. Moreover, the risk mitigation strategies were evaluated using the Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method, considering the previously prioritized risks. The analysis ranked Corruption, Circular Debts, Outdated Infrastructure, Energy Losses, and Lack of Research and Development as the most critical risks. For risk mitigation measures, Incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building an Investor-Friendly Environment, Improved Coordination between Organisations, and Maximizing the Energy Efficiency Potential gained preference, among other measures.

Moreover, simultaneous multiple customer configuration is not considered. In this study, a service configuration optimization model for multiple customers considering service process information and time-varying service resource constraints was established based on quality function deployment (QFD). The model was transformed into a linear model to facilitate determination of a solution. It was then extended by considering uncertainty in the QFD and further transformed into a triple-objective model. A space-partitioning algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) were developed to obtain the exact Pareto set of the triple-objective model for small-scale and non-dominated solutions for large-scale problems, respectively. A case study and numerical experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the results show that the two developed algorithms performed well. Decision support systems based on the proposed models and algorithms can help a service company provide customized services to improve customer satisfaction and increase market share.}

The objective of this paper is to identify the stakeholders' requirements and critical success factors (CSFs) for the sustainability initiative in SC during this pandemic situation. Three potential stakeholders' requirements and a total of 16 critical success factors have been identified by taking inputs from experts and decision-makers. Further, these critical factors are analyzed and ranked based on a hybrid quality function deployment (QFD)-best-worst methodology (BWM). The QFD method has been used to identify the stakeholder’ requirements. And, the BWM has been adopted to prioritize the CSFs. The scientific value of the study is the contribution of the framework model for the sustainable initiatives in the SC during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, identification of stakeholders’ requirements and CSFs, and prioritizes these CSFs. The top three most critical success factors are found to be social distancing, emergency logistics systems, and emergency backup facilities. The proposed framework provides a roadmap to operation and supply chain managers to come up with good solutions for sustainability initiatives in the supply chain during and after the pandemic outbreak.}
