abstract = {This study introduces the research issues on closed-loop product lifecycle management (PLM) where product information flow is closed due to emerging technologies. PLM is a new strategic approach to manage the product lifecycle information efficiently over the whole product lifecycle. Recently, with emerging technologies, PLM enables us to gather and analyze the product lifecycle information and make decisions on several issues without spatial and temporal constraints. However, the PLM system just provides us with new opportunities to gain the competitiveness. To remove ineffectiveness within the product lifecycle and maximize the advantage of closed-loop PLM, it is necessary to look into new challenging issues. For this purpose, first, we introduce the concept of closed-loop PLM. Then, we explore several research problems that become highlighted in the closed-loop PLM. For each product lifecycle phase, we introduce research issues with the review of their previous research and address the requirements for resolving them. Finally, we close with discussion about our work and introduction of further research issues.}

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to explore what challenges exist when setting requirements for an Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO). An IPSO, sometimes called Product Service System, is a concept with increased interest from manufacturing companies. It consists of a combination of products and services that, based on a life cycle perspective, have been integrated to fit targeted customer needs. In order to achieve a successful IPSO, it is important to collect aspects from many actors, something which sometimes is challenging for companies moving towards providing IPSOs. The four challenges found when setting requirements in IPSO development are; identification and inclusion of relevant aspects from relevant actors throughout the IPSO’s life cycle, understanding of the underlying aspects for all requirements for all elements of the offering, prioritization of requirements, and the difficulty to track how requirements affect each other between different elements in the IPSO. The methodology used to find these challenges was a combination of a structured literature review and an interview study at three manufacturing companies moving towards providing IPSOs.}

abstract = {Exploring the potential of new models for mapping groundwater quality presents a major challenge in water resource management, particularly in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, where groundwater faces contamination risks. This study aimed to explore the applicability of random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models to predict groundwater quality. Particularly, these two models were integrated into cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (B) techniques to build predictive models, including RF-CV, RF-B, ANN-CV, and ANN-B. Entropy groundwater quality index (EWQI) was converted to normalized EWQI which was then classified into five levels from very poor to very good. A total of twelve physicochemical parameters from 180 groundwater wells, including potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and total hardness, were investigated to decipher groundwater quality in the eastern part of Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. Our results indicated that groundwater quality in the study area was primarily polluted by calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate and that the RF-CV model (RMSE = 0.06, R2 = 0.87, MAE = 0.04) outperformed the RF-B (RMSE = 0.07, R2 = 0.80, MAE = 0.04), ANN-CV (RMSE = 0.09, R2 = 0.70, MAE = 0.06), and ANN-B (RMSE = 0.10, R2 = 0.67, MAE = 0.06). Our findings highlight the superiority of the RF models over the ANN models based on the CV and B techniques. In addition, the role of groundwater parameters to the normalized EWQI in various machine learning models was found. The groundwater quality map created by the RF-CV model can be applied to orient groundwater use.}

The proposed CALSEMP addresses six focus areas identified by the NDIA including systems engineering trade study and design decision methodologies; system integration, assembly, and test analyses modeling; enterprise level supply chain design; electrical, mechanical, and assembly yield modeling; quantitative analyses; and life cycle cost modeling. The analysis was performed at Georgia Tech using an integrated product and process design approach to systems engineering, with qualitative and quantitative tools, such as the house of quality, morphological matrix, Pugh and TOPSIS methods. We present the alternative concepts studied and our proposed master's program, which will hopefully enable aerospace industries to compete on the global aerospace market by providing them with tools that help them better integrate all these concerns throughout the product life cycle.}

abstract = {This article proposes a novel approach that uses a mathematical model optimized by Genetic Algorithms harmonized with the Russian theory of problem solving and invention (TRIZ) to design an export packing of Persian Lime. The mathematical model (with functional elements of non-spatial type) optimizes the spaces of the Persian Lime Packing, maximizes the Resistance to Vertical Compression and minimizes the Amount of Material Used, according to the operation restrictions of the packing during the transport of the merchandise. This approach is developed in four phases: the identification of the solution space; the optimization of the conceptual design; the application of TRIZ; and the generation of the final proposal solution. The results show the proposed packing (with 28% less cardboard) supports at least the same vertical load with respect to the nearest competitor packing. However, with the same number of packings per pallet and pallets per container, the space used by the packing assembled and deployed in the container is greater by 10% and 38% respectively. Besides, TRIZ includes innovative non-spatial elements such as the airflow and the friction of the product inside the packing. The contribution of this approach can be replicable for the packing design of other horticultural products of the agri-food chain.}

Model development methodology comprises an integrated preliminary cost estimation system (IPCES), and complex quality functions and deployment of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. An actual case project is used to validate and illustrate model corresponding estimating capabilities. The proposed model is engineered to enhance existing techniques implemented by bridge stakeholders and designers to prepare cost estimates at the conceptual design stage by taking into consideration box-girder bridge project site preparations, substructure, and superstructure. The proposed model is anticipated to be of major significance to designers and its contribution resides into the integration of BrIM technologies with cost estimation approaches.}

The presence of a large degree of uncertainty leads to high R&D risks, resulting in many R&D failures.

This paper proposes a new risk management framework that aligns project risk management with corporate strategy and a performance measurement system to increase success rates of R&D projects and to accomplish corporate strategic goals. The balanced scorecard is used to identify major performance measures of an R&D organization based on the firm vision and strategy. Quality function deployment is adapted to transform organizational performance measures into project performance measures and a systematic procedure is developed for risk identification, assessment, response planning, and control. The proposed risk management framework enables an R&D project to be focused on achieving the corporate goals and provides a more effective way to identify, assess, analyze, and monitor R&D risks along the project cycle. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a drug development project.}

Consumers are starting to give value to products that introduce innovations with a positive impact on the environment, these innovations are incorporated into the manufacturing process or in the product design itself. With that, enterprises also see this as a competitive advantage and are now focusing on how to keep up with these evolving requirements. Given that product design and development is no easy feat, especially eco-design, this study develops a systematic methodology on how enterprises and designers can translate all green-related requirements to create the best product designs. This research identifies a specific list of requirements called “green features” wherein eco-efficiency approaches and environmental directives are taken into account. The methodology utilizes the TRIZ tools for innovating products with the consideration of green features. To begin with, the function and attribute analysis is used to identify the target product profile with its essential green features. Then, in order to fulfill the requirement of each applicable green feature, the contradiction matrix is adopted to innovate the product. In addition, an evaluation and screening tool is used to assess and select the best product design to give users confidence that they are selecting the best option. Finally, a case study is done to validate the performance of the methodology. The case study successfully created three product designs that are significantly better than the existing ones. We believe that this innovative process can serve as a reference for product designers.}

The concept of leveraging considers not only the efficiency of manufacturing a product but all consumption of energy or other natural resources during the life cycle of the product. In this process, one of the bottlenecks to more efficient engines is the exhaust valve. The valve and valve seat together perform the function of ensuring the entry of air and combustible material, the output of combustion gases and the sealing function during the compression and combustion processes. The valve is the most demanding component in high efficiency engines. To ensure the rigor of operation while providing clean burning and low emissions, the application of special materials is necessary. The extremely high temperatures of the exhaust gases, the velocities of valves and the high operating pressure are only some of the parameters that cause wear on valves. The materials used in valve production must be characterized by good workability, low wear, good mechanical strength and good fatigue and corrosion resistance at high temperatures. In this context, the CCM/ITA and SENAI CIMATEC jointly developed a workbench to simulate the durability of valves and valve seats, analyze their wear resistance and evaluate their behavior with varying parameters. This paper shows the workbench development process and a new testing method that considers the high engine operation temperatures and focuses on reducing the new material development life cycle and the emissions during the product usage life time.}

In this paper, the interactive modular design process is established by the analysis of the relationship between a product or service of integrated service product (ISP) and the analysis of the physical module and service module. This paper deals with the module partition principle of ISP, puts forward the three-stages module partition processes and methods, mainly including service module partition processes based on the “Top-Down” and “Bottom-Up” methods, the physical module partition process based on the “Top-Down”, and the module partition methods based on Quality Function Deployment and mapping matrix. Finally, a case study is done on an electric power transformer using proposed principle and methods, and the processes and methods can achieve the interactive module partition of ISP.}

abstract = {The quest for home energy products that would reduce electricity bills, avoid kilowatt-hours of electricity generation, and minimize carbon footprint has sparked the innovation of many energy efficient technologies. The CO2 heat pump water heater (HPWH) is one such innovation led by Japan, the technology leader of the Pacific Rim. The product was developed over the last decade, and many countries have configured the technology to local needs due to the benign nature and high efficiency potential of the technology. However, CO2 HPWH has yet to enter the Pacific Northwest market. Hence, a detailed roadmap needs to be outlined for the replacement of the existing less efficient water heaters and the integration of the CO2 HPWH technology in the region. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), has been relentlessly working towards energy efficiency as one of its many community outreach programs. The CO2 Heat Pump Water Heater is one of a kind project initiated by the BPA in collaboration with the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA). With guidance from experts at BPA, NEEA, the Energy Trust of Oregon, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and other stakeholders, an “action plan” has been developed focusing on CO2 refrigerant technologies for heat pump water heater applications. The project identifies where opportunities exist in the coming years for specific actions to be taken in the areas of emerging technologies research, utility program development, market research, and related activities to help increase regional adoption of these energy-efficient systems. The roadmap has given some interesting insights. Projects are undertaken for improving the efficiency of components and equipment technology. Extensive testing and measure development initiatives are headed towards facilitating enactment of law or regulation. However, cost is one of the most important aspect in adoption of the technology and utilities and other stakeholders needs to come forward in incentivizing the project.}

This paper presents an incremental Bhattacharyya dissimilarity (IBD) for measuring histogram based descriptors (HBDs) used for particle weight estimation. IBD is defined by incorporating an incremental similarity matrix (ISM) into the BD. Such an ISM imposes the incremental similarity beliefs on the matched bin patches of two input histograms and enables a cross-bin interaction during the comparison, which yields the enhanced capability of discriminating the particles located in the object from those positioned in the background. We propose a robust approach to compute the ISM by jointly utilizing the spatial and temporal attributes. Also, to handle target appearance changes and deformations, a classification-inspired target model update strategy is presented. These components lead to an effective and robust tracking algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that IBD shows promising discriminative capability in comparison with other state of the art dissimilarity measures. Moreover, the IBD based PF-tracker also exhibits competitive tracking performance, especially under scenarios of partial occlusion and background clutter.}

Handicrafts' Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have an expanding market in developed countries. The impact of the pandemic on this industry is severe due to the industry's informal nature and seasonal demand. The survival and resilience of these handicraft MSMEs face many challenges in the post-COVID-19 outbreak. The focus of the present study is to understand and analyze the key challenges for building resilience in handicraft MSMEs by scrutinizing the existing literature and interactions with stakeholders. EFA and the Grey DEMATEL approach are used to analyze the challenges for the adoption of resilience. EFA is used to categorize the challenges into various dimensions. The study has divided the challenges for the inclusion of resilience into survivable, sustainable, and viable categories using EFA to plan for short- and long-term business growth. Grey DEMATEL is being utilized for understanding these contextual relationships for each resilience dimension. Grey systems theory is a methodology that enables the incorporation of improbability and vagueness into the analysis. Findings of the study revealed the influencing challenges for each of the dimensions such as competition from machine-made products, insufficient government support and incentives for export, and inefficient managerial concern and response to internationalization as the prominent challenges. The results of this study illustrate the causal relationships amongst the identified resilience challenges to the various stakeholders. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure resilience, as well as understanding the cause-effect relationship. Managerial implications and Policy insights for building the resilience of handicraft MSMEs are discussed in detail.}

To assess and mitigate seawater intrusion, the affected aquifers need to be characterized. By integrating geophysical investigation and multivariate statistical analysis of hydrochemical data, seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers at Cha-Am District in Phetchaburi Province (Thailand), as a model area that is adversely affected by this problem, was evaluated. The vertical electrical sounding (VES) survey study was conducted at 80 locations, and then 47 VES locations were used to create four pseudo cross-section lines in a west-east direction. The geophysical results were described together with the hydrochemical analysis of 57 groundwater samples revealed that seawater intrusion occurred in the Quarternary colluvial sediment aquifer at an average depth of 50–60 m. A resistivity value of <5 Ωm represented areas that were highly impacted by seawater intrusion, while a range between 5 and 10 Ωm represented moderately contaminated areas. The hydrochemical characteristics, divided the groundwater into three groups according to the level of impact of seawater intrusion: (i) Ca2+-Na+-HCO3- and (ii) Ca2+-HCO3--Cl-; (slightly impacted) and (iii) Na+-Cl- (highly impacted). The hydrochemical facies evolution diagram (HFED) revealed that most of the samples fell close to the mixing line, demonstrating mixing between seawater and fresh water and that some samples fell in the intrusion phase. Multivariate analysis was in agreement with the HFED. Furthermore, the northern part of the study area faced seawater intrusion with a relatively higher impact than other areas.}

We explore transfer learning techniques through Behavioral Cloning (BC), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), and Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) pretraining, which allow the RL agent to acquire fundamental knowledge before real-world exploration. This transferred knowledge steers exploration towards near-optimal and safer regions. GAIL and Sim2Real pretrained agents deliver satisfactory control performance right after pretraining, cutting process trips during online training by factors of 8 and 27, respectively. Further online training reduces Integral Squared Error (ISE) for interface tracking by 71% with GAIL and 22% with Sim2Real. ISE for tailings density tracking also decreases by 73% and 33%, respectively. This significant reduction demonstrates RL's continual learning ability suitable for autonomous control. This work highlights the potential for safely deploying RL in process automation and reveals that RLC can handle complex control problems in multivariate, multimodal, partially observable, and uncertain environments. RLC achieves Model Predictive Control (MPC)-level performance but with less controller effort, and computation time faster by a factor of 10.}

In its conceptual design process, functional determination based on customer needs (CAs), intelligence demands (IDs) and manufacture constraints (MCs) is the prerequisite and basis for subsequent design work. As these various requirement information becomes more complex and mixed, a practical design method will improve the design efficiency of this type of problem. Although research on requirement acquisition and transformation methods has been intensively studied, this problem is still difficult to solve by traditional methods due to the multi-source heterogeneous characteristics of requirement information. To overcome this problem, a requirements mapping methodology is proposed to decompose and transform multi-source heterogeneous requirements and map them to different functional knowledge (FK). Multi-source design requirements are categorized by different objectives such as manufacturing, customer, and intelligence, and these heterogeneous information is analyzed by the decomposition method corresponding to them. The conceptual scheme (CS) is derived through a four-step selection process: requirement set (RS) determination, FK mapping, knowledge combination, and scheme evaluation. The prototype design and an experimental study of a brand-new intelligent folding gantry crane is conducted. The results show that the proposed method can not only improve the design efficiency of intelligent manufacturing equipment, but also reduce the repetitive work in the detailed design stage.}

abstract = {Upper-limb rehabilitation devices are essential in restoring and improving the motor function of hemiplegic patients. However, developing a product design that meets the needs of users is challenging. Current design tools and methods suffer from limitations such as a single model, poor synergy between integrated models, and subjective bias in analysing user needs and translating them into product attributes. To address these issues, this study proposes a new structural design decision-making model based on Behaviour Analysis (B), Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), and Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadatch (TRIZ theory). The model was developed and applied to design an upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeleton for hemiplegia. In this paper, an empirical investigation was conducted in several rehabilitation hospitals in Xuzhou City and used user journey mapping to identify potential failure points in the behaviour process. Then, the fault models were ranked according to the Fuzzy Risk Priority Number (FRPN) calculated by FMEA and used TRIZ theory to determine principles for resolving contradictions and generating creative design solutions for the product. By integrating B, FMEA, and TRIZ theory, it eliminated subjective bias in product design, improved the design decision-making process, and provided new methods and ideas for designing assistive rehabilitation devices and similar products. The framework of the proposed approach can be used in other contexts to develop effective and precise product designs that meet the needs of users.}

To achieve the goal, this study introduces conceptual UCD and Latent Semantic Engineering (LSE), a new conceptual UCD approach, defines measures for model accuracy (MA), conceptual matching accuracy (CMA), user-centered design accuracy (UCDA), and conceptual design accuracy (CDA), and compares the LSE approach to other approaches. The LSE approach models conceptual design processes more accurately than other approaches. Functional approaches use subjective weights to match functional needs to physical designs. Emotional (aesthetic) approaches use statistical models to match physical designs to emotional needs. The LSE approach uses a LSE semantic space model to create complete conceptual (aspirational, emotional, functional, physical) designs from complete conceptual needs. The LSE approach improves model accuracy (MA) and matching accuracy (CMA, UCDA, and CDA), compared to other approaches. The LSE approach creates design descriptions more accurately than other approaches. The LSE approach matches designs to user choices, needs, and concepts more accurately than other approaches. This study uses the LSE approach to create customized cell phone designs for individual users. The approach can also be used to create other conceptual designs for either individual or multiple users. Study results can be used to improve product quality, customer satisfaction, product success, and the product development process.}

At the same time, opportunities for value creation call for a collaborative framework for economic, environmental, and social industrial benefits among multiple countries to achieve sustainable value creation. Based on international cooperation in sustainable manufacturing, existing design and assessment methodologies can be adapted to increase innovation by utilizing the dynamics of competition and cooperation. This paper focuses on bridging this gap by implementing an approach for adaptively transforming the industrial engineering education principles and practices with the associated research methodologies from developed countries into manufacturing systems in emerging and developing countries. To achieve this transformative approach for sustainable development through education and research, developed countries promote their best practice education cultures in emerging and developing countries. Based on the need for technological and managerial methodologies for sustainable manufacturing, the set of capabilities for industrial engineering are analyzed, and educational principles are selected. As an example of the approach proposed in this paper, a new reformed program for industrial engineering merges the needs of the Turkish manufacturing industry with the German application-oriented education and research culture. The educational program guides stakeholders to generate a common understanding and utilize bilateral opportunities for sustainable value creation in manufacturing.}

However, researcher considered more requirements from product manufacturing/assemble stage, and less requirements from product operation stage. Identifying subsystems to be improved and risk analysis is two methods applied to product design considering the effect of failure at product operation stage. But these methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks and need a lot of expert knowledge. There are huge amounts of data including inspection reports and maintenance records in product operation stage. These data can offer meaningful feedback on next-generation product design. The past few years, digital twin has gained considerable attention because it is characterized by two-way interactions between the digital and physical worlds. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) framework for product to-be-designed analysis based on operation data. DT data is collected and store from the operation stage of current product. DT data is processed and analyzed to acquire the operation knowledge by Clustering algorithm, Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, Multi-attribute decision-making, etc. The failure knowledge is used for the design of next-generation product. It can help designer to identify subsystems to be improved and offer the failure information for risk analysis. The failure knowledge also predicts the easily failure subsystems at operation stage of current product. A case of Tunnel Boring Machine is given to illustrate the implementation process of the framework and realize the part function of the framework.}

First, distributors frequently must simultaneously satisfy several conflicting objectives like minimizing cost and maximizing customer satisfaction so the model is multiobjective. Second, attributes and requirements on the assignments are both qualitative and quantitative in format and the methodology permits this. Finally, an example is also provided to illustrate how the methodology can be used in practice.}

The research question of identifying the product AECs is answered in this study, and three key issues are solved in the proposed methodology. First, the contribution of product engineering characteristics to customer requirements is calculated using an orthogonal experimental design, and the optimal level combination of engineering characteristics to satisfy the customer requirements is determined through the analysis of variation. Subsequently, the relative importance of engineering characteristics is calculated based on data envelopment analysis. Next, an agility index is defined by integrating the customer satisfaction degree, the relative importance degree of engineering characteristics, and the variation of the level of engineering characteristics, to identify the AECs. Finally, based on the identification of the AECs of an electric vehicle air-conditioning heat pump scroll compressor, the results are analysed and compared to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

To evaluate the MRI findings of patients with ischiofemoral impingement in comparison to healthy subjects.
Materials and methods
The study included 34 subjects; 14 patients clinically suspected to have ischiofemoral impingement and twenty volunteer subjects used as a control group. The MRI images were evaluated for both hip joints for two measurable parameters; the ischiofemoral space (IFS) and the quadratus femoris space (QFS). The quadratus femoris muscles were evaluated for; muscle edema, tear, or muscle atrophy. Statistical analysis was performed with the (Minitab Ver.16). The Paired t-test and ANOVA test were used to analyze differences of the distance measurements in each side of the patient group as well as both sides in the control group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine optimal threshold values of IFS and QFS using (MedCalc software, version 12.7.8.0.).
Results
There were statistical differences between affected hip and healthy hip regarding IFS and QFS (P=0.000) associated with QF muscle changes ranged from focal edema to partial tear in the affected joints.
Conclusion
Ischiofemoral impingement is an uncommon cause of hip pain. Our study illustrates the MR spectrum of IFS, QFS and quadratus femoris muscle abnormalities.}

Furthermore, domain-specific solutions fail to fully capture these requirements in manufacturing, especially in assembly lines. Therefore, a human-centered design approach is essential to empower operators and strengthen their acceptance of digital assistance systems. The question arises of how to implement such an approach in manufacturing and how to engage assembly line operators to meet their requirements and enhance adoption. In this work, we propose a mixed-methods approach that involves workers as much as possible in the conception and design of enhanced digital assistance systems. The approach provides a new foundation for operator empowerment in assembly lines, which we demonstrate in a use case from the automotive sector. This demonstration includes the results of a first workshop with workers, identifying their requirements and discussing their needs. The future work consists of developing design prototypes for an assistance system, which will be evaluated by interviewing the end-users and investigating its impact with comparison measures.}

But the Kano model alone could not provide enough insight in the early stages of new product development, therefore, the HWWP (Health Weapon Wealth Prospect) model appeared. This approach could have been the key to understanding how customers think if it were not for the respondents’ response bias in the importance assessment of each analyzed product feature. The present study envisages to propose a refinement of the HWWP model in which the importance of wants variable is replaced by AHP’s specialist hierarchy.

In addition, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is utilized to reduce engine out NOx emission. To realize these functions, a multivariable control system needs to control both VGT and EGR valve to deliver desired intake manifold (or boost) pressure, and desired EGR flow rate. This two-input and two-output system is nonlinear with cross-couplings between the boost and EGR responses to the input actuators, the system parameters are varying with different engine operating conditions. This paper proposes a closed loop design of a multivariable VGT/EGR control system for a turbocharged diesel engine. The control system is synthesized based on quantitative feedback theory to maintain robust stability and performance via sequential MIMO loop shaping in the frequency domain. Experiment results are included from a turbocharged diesel engine to show the effectiveness of the proposed control design.}

abstract = {Owing to the typical vagueness or imprecision of customer requirements (CRs) in product planning house of quality (PPHOQ), determining the final importance of CRs is very difficult. Combining rough set theory, Kano’s model, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and scale method, an integrated method is proposed to obtain the final importance of CRs in PPHOQ. Firstly, by using relative reduction and relative core in rough set theory, a decision system is built to acquire CRs in PPHOQ. Secondly, based on relative positive field in rough set, the decision system is simplified and its corresponding new decision system is established to determine the fundamental importance ratings of CRs. Thirdly, by integrating scale method into AHP approach, calculating formulas of the importance rating of achieving the improvement ratio of satisfaction estimation of a CR are developed. Next, for every CR, based on a combination of its fundamental importance rating, the importance rating of achieving the improvement ratio of its satisfaction estimation, and “its sales point”, its final importance rating is determined. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented method.}

abstract = {The competitiveness in the aerospace industry is steadilly increasing, at the same time there is a rapid development of new technology for next generations of jet engines. To achieve one of the most important goals, reducing weight, fabrication of structural components is one possible approach, common to many aerospace manufacturers. However, the engineering work becomes more difficult and requires new knowledge. Production becomes significantly more complicated as the need of different manufacturing processes increases, as well as the complexity of other production related activities. In the paper, definitions of producibility and manufacturability are discussed, together with related metrics for measurement of the impact of the product design on a production system. The result is a recommended set of methodologies and tools to manage and evaluate the manufacturing interests and targets, and how they must be reached and balanced within the product development process, in order to improve producibility. The work has also identified gaps and opportunities for improvements, and suggested an approach for next step in order to increase producibility in manufacturing of aerospace engine components.}

The aim of the proposed method consists in building an improved risk management model for design and to enhance the capability of anticipating problems and technical solutions to reduce failure occurrence. The method adopts tools used to model the system, such as functionality, Su-Fields models, resource evaluation and tools dedicated to problem solving such as standard solutions. The resulting method allows a better definition of the system decomposition and functioning and provides a sharp definition of the events and failures potentially occurring into the system, which is not provided by standard FMEA. Moreover, the high importance given to resources since the beginning of the method is extremely effective for understanding system evolution and to generate resource-based solution to problems dealing with product risk. The overall method has been developed so that technicians are not supposed to have a high level expertise in TRIZ tools. In order to evaluate the method it was tested with students with basic level TRIZ education and some application with industrial case studies were performed.}

abstract = {With the advent of next-generation information technologies and artificial intelligence, the paradigm of product design is shifting towards a more data-driven approach. To facilitate the reuse of historical product data, designers require systematic and structured methods for data analysis and processing to enhance design efficiency. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a sophisticated statistical model adept at analyzing and forecasting sequential data patterns, is a powerful tool enabling designers to process and utilize historical product data effectively. This paper proposes a generative adaptable design method based on HMM to assist designers in rapidly generating design solutions. The proposed method utilizes HMM to model the structural modules and their connections within historical products, enabling designers to efficiently reuse existing product modules to generate diverse design configurations optimized to user requirements. Concurrently, a three-dimensional sparse matrix is used to mathematically represent the connection relations among module interfaces, facilitating the transformation of HMM-derived into design solutions with rational connections. The entropy method of product adaptability is utilized to evaluate the design solutions and identify the optimal solution. A case study of the design process for the Hybrid Additive Manufacturing device is conducted to verify the effectiveness of this method. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively assists designers in generating multiple design solutions and determining the optimal design outcome through the adaptability evaluation, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the design process.}

Efficient user needs elicitation does achieve considerable benefits for maintaining higher competitiveness and a speedier lifecycle. However, there is inevitably an online review scarcity about new products due to the short time on the market and low buyer recognition compared with commonly used products. This paper proposes a small sample data-driven method for user needs elicitation from online reviews in new product iteration. In the first stage, a scraped initial online review dataset is pre-processed roughly to improve the data quality. And then, reviews are classified into multiple categories according to different topics using ERNIE. In the second stage, each topic-based dataset is reprocessed in detail. Thereafter, the key user needs set is determined and facilitated by extracting key product information phrases from every single dataset using improved SIFRank. Moreover, the case study of a smart cat feeder is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the ERNIE-ISIFRank methodology. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed method which is primarily based on the pre-trained language model to enhance the deep understanding of the semantics of online reviews. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can assist in identifying key user needs with high efficiency.}

The voice of the customer (VOC) was captured and translated to engineering characteristics using ECQFD. Design options were identified using ECQFD and correlated with TRIZ to identify innovative design alternatives. Selection of the best design alternatives under many criteria is a typical multicriteria decision-making problem. We used AHP to identify the best design in terms of innovation and sustainability. These design changes were then incorporated in the component. A case study involving design of an automotive component demonstrates the applicability of our approach.}

Consumers' improper consumption of fashion exacerbates these environmental impacts. Post-consumer textile can be managed by consumers via deciding on the particular practices reducing the textile waste. Consumers play a significant role in shaping the fashion industry as their attitudes towards extending a garment's life cycle and supporting recycling impact the business practices of suppliers. This study analyzes post-consumer textile waste (post-consumer textile waste) management options for consumers and factors affecting the consumer attitudes. The study identifies consumer options, conducts a bibliometric analysis (BA) and detailed literature review to address the gap in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques; in doing so, it proves the originality of the selected ORESTE technique for the field of study and proposes a novel picture fuzzy sets approach based ORESTE methodology to sustainably manage PCTWs. The findings of the study reveals that the among the alternative sustainable PCTW management practices; extended producer responsibility actions is the most preferred action followed by donation, reuse, recycling, composting, second-hand shopping and swapping, respectively. The originally of this paper grounds on the fact that there is no comprehensive list of these practices with a consumer perspective, and no ORESTE approach or picture fuzzy set application in the literature. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the real preferences of consumers as practical implications, and by attracting the attention of industry representatives to take which practices into consideration most. Besides, this paper makes a theoretical contribution by proposing a novel fuzzy MCDM approach, and by offering an alternative to the Besson ranking procedure.}

Thus, an accurate and prompt analysis of customer requirements (CRs) in the early design stage is critical to its success. However, most OKP companies are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to the limited resources and low product planning budget, they often cannot obtain abundant CR information nor can they afford the expense of complicated planning process. To address these issues, a system framework is proposed in support of OKP product planning process in a cloud-based design (CBD) environment. The challenges and future market niches of OKP companies are presented. The comparison of typical distributed systems shows that CBD, which utilizes advanced information technologies and business model, has advantages in providing sufficient resources, decreasing product development time span for OKP companies in a cost-efficient way. This article describes the proposed system architecture, the business interaction process and the information communication among customers, designers and marketing analysts at the product planning stage. To validate the proposed framework, a prototype system module MyProduct is under development in the CBD environment with an illustrative example.}

A number of models/approaches have been developed, however, which can assist managers and others in developing new and improved services. This paper argues that a panoramic, or holistic, approach to NSD and a high level of precision at the micro level, will combine to provide a more successful service design and NSD process. Five models from the new product/service development literature are used to illustrate how the approach can be applied to a complex multi-faceted service such as a hospital.}

In the context of product development, functional design is one of the most challenging but rewarding design activities. On the one hand, designers must extract useful information from a large amount of diversified, unstructured, and even inconsistent customer voices. On the other hand, designers must formulate a set of functional requirements that are inherently intangible, solution-neutral, and arguably subjective. Functional design exerts great impacts on the formation of innovative design thinking. It is especially difficult for novice designers who are naturally inclined to rapidly dive into the solution space with little exploration of the problem space. This paper presents a systematic functional design framework to guide novice designers, through a step-by-step process, to sequentially investigate the customer domain, explore the functional domain, and manage design couplings between customer needs and functional requirements. A collection of existing design methods is incorporated, in an adaptive manner, into the framework to facilitate the execution of each step. To date, the proposed framework has been iteratively taught, practiced, and refined based on two engineering design courses since 2013.}

abstract = {For more than 30 years, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been recognized as strategic for organizations worldwide. However, a significant number of Quality Management (QM) initiatives have still not been successful. Some authors argue that this number can achieve more than 60% of the implemented cases. This paper aims at describing how Brazilian Companies use Quality Management Practices. By conducting a survey with 125 respondents, the current status of Quality Management Practices utilization in Brazil was investigated. The analysis of QM practices reveals that companies prefer the usage and give more importance to soft practices such as teamwork and customer focus. On the other hand, companies give less importance to and do not use hard practices such as Analysis of Variance and Six Sigma. According to the respondents, Brazilian companies are at a middle stage of QM maturity level: more than 30% attest that their companies are at “inspection” age and less than 20% state that their companies have achieved strategic quality management. This unsatisfactory level of QM maturity can mean that Brazilian companies manage quality with more focus on inspection and control than quality assurance and strategic management. Therefore “improvement” in this context can mean bringing the operation back to the standard than indeed improving the standard. Finally, future research derived from these findings could investigate how QM practices would be effectively used and help companies to achieve higher QM maturity levels and strategic quality management.}

This data opens up new opportunities for the analysis of quality issues, but it also makes identifying, selecting, and correctly interpreting data all the more critical. This involves a multitude of domain experts that design, operate and maintain production equipment. Major challenges they face in this context are (i) to map and integrate their domain knowledge on potential failure modes and effects, products, processes and production assets; and (ii) to coordinate their actions to systematically investigate and address the most important issues first. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the FMEA-linked-to-PPR Asset Issue Analysis (FPI) Model, a multi-view coordination asset, to guide quality issue analyses. The model integrates cross-domain knowledge and facilitates tracking the investigation state of quality analyses in teams of domain experts. A preliminary evaluation on a real-world use case indicates the FPI model to facilitate effective cross-domain analytic processes and the efficient identification of potential causes for quality issues.}

Based on nine quality parameters (textural, colour and sensory properties), a mathematical model for calculating a single total quality index (TQI) of dried apples packed in different types of packaging in normal and modified atmosphere has been introduced. At the beginning of the study, apples dried in supercritical CO2 had the best scores. After six months, samples dried in supercritical CO2 and freeze dried apples, both packed in polyethylene coated aluminium with 100% N2, scored similarly. The six month shelf-life research revealed that measurable changes occur during the second half of the shelf-life when it is possible to clearly distinguish differences in the overall quality index of different dried apple slices.}

Many of the existing tools and techniques in sustainable product development consider sustainability requirements as part of customer requirements. This may reduce the importance of sustainability requirements over customer requirements. In addition, the tools that reckon customer requirements and sustainability requirements separately, do not weigh them based on their importance. Some other tools do not ponder all the three dimensions of sustainable development namely environmental, social and economic. A new tool named ‘Customer and Sustainability Requirements Evaluation Matrix’ (CSRE Matrix) that evaluates ‘Customer Requirements’ and ‘Sustainability Requirements’ separately during new product development is presented in this paper. A case study has been conducted in an umbrella manufacturing industry for explaining the usefulness of the CSRE Matrix and the results have been reported.}

This phenomenon is probably caused by the insufficient evaluation on user experience and by the lag between user requirement changes and the offered solutions. Both limitations can be mitigated via automatic Smart PSS evaluation based on broader concerns on user experience information that was collected from either product-service bundles or user behavior. In this paper, a context-aware concept evaluation approach is proposed for Smart PSS design iteration, aiming to satisfy users in a more timely and automatic manner. Derived from the conventional information axiom method, the proposed approach introduces a context-aware evaluation indicator identification module and an automatic system range identification procedure based on natural language processing techniques, and eventually return the most robust concepts during the usage phase. With less human intervention in the design process, it relieves the lag between user requirement changes and the solutions, and reduces the prescriptive instructions in the conventional information axiom method. A case study of a 3D printer company’s design iteration is conducted, which proves the proposed approach’s feasibility. It is hoped that this work provides practical guidance for achieving a more context-aware Smart PSS development.}

However, the suitability of a method strongly depends on the variability of the time series involved in the system. This work compares the methods Averaging, k-Medoids and OPT for the selection of representative days by carrying out the optimization of grid-connected and standalone polygeneration systems for a building in two different locations. The suitability of the representative days obtained with each method were assessed regarding the optimization of the polygeneration systems. Sizing errors under 5% were achieved by using 14 representative days, and the computational time, with respect to the entire year data, was reduced from hours to a few seconds. The results demonstrated that the Averaging method is suitable when there is low variability in the time series data; but, when the time series presents high stochastic variability (e.g., consideration of wind energy), the OPT method presented better performance. Also, a new method has been developed for the selection of representative days by combining the k-Medoids and OPT methods, although its implementation requires additional computational effort.}

This paper presents a design method that combines interaction design with axiomatic design. The proposed method first employs interaction design to acquire user needs with respect to three aspects: “people”, “products” and “environment” and then adopts axiomatic design to complete the conceptual design. The methodology is demonstrated and validated with a case study of children bicycle. The results show that the proposed method significantly enhances users’ experience of the product and meets more comprehensive user needs, especially in terms of users’ psychological and spiritual needs.}

This paper concentrates on the state-of-the-art survey of the BWM based on the in-depth analysis over the publications concerning this method published from 2015 to 26th, January 2019. This paper intends to answer five questions about the BWM: (1) How does this method perform in bibliometric analysis? (2) Why to propose this method and what is it? (3) Which integrations that the BWM were focused on and which areas did they apply to? (4) What extensions of this method were investigated? (5) What are the challenges and future research directions regarding this method? In view of the fact that the research on this method is still in infancy, this paper has guiding significance for the later research related to the BWM. From the theoretical point of view, the reasonable value of consistency ratio, the inconsistency improving methods, the uncertain extensions of the BWM and the techniques for solving multi-optimality model in the BWM are good research issues that need to be further investigated in the future.

The survey was made among the stakeholders of the Indian Shrimp Industry in order to set the future goals, and concurrent objectives and to design strategies to achieve them. The first round of Delphi survey resulted into generation of sets of Goal, Objectives, and Strategies. The second round of the survey gathered opinions of survey panelists regarding the desirability and feasibility of the Goals and Objectives, and feasibility and effectiveness of the Strategies. Consensuses of stakeholders’ opinions on the each of the items with respect to above said criteria were estimated using standard fuzzy consensus building algorithm. Hierarchical representation of a Goal, their corresponding Objectives and Strategies form a tree like structure, called as GOS tree. Seven such GOS trees were developed, each representing a Goal at its top echelon. Validity of each GOS tree was tested using the ratings of the panelists on the goal, objectives, and strategies with respect to the feasibility criterion. The proposed validation process of a GOS tree resulted two set of weights separately for the objectives and the strategies that explained the importance of each of the strategies in achieving the corresponding objective and importance of each of the objectives in aligning towards the goal. These importance weights of the objectives and the strategies were local to the GOS tree. Seven such GOS trees were developed each representing for a future goal. As a strategy might have presence in multiple GOS trees and contributing towards multiple goals, an overall contribution of the strategies was to be found out. We proposed a framework, House of Strategy, which can be used to combine all the GOS trees at one place and could help, in a two-step process, in finding out the overall contribution of each of the strategies towards overall achievement of Industry’s goals. The House of Strategy consisted of two sub-Houses, i.e. Goal-Objective (GO) and Objective-Strategy (OS) sub-Houses. In the first step, the GO sub-House calculated the overall priority of each of the Objectives depending on its local importance weights (with respect to each of the GOS tree it represented) and corresponding desirability of the local goal and its own desirability score. Similarly, in the second step, the OS sub-House helped in calculating the overall priority of each of the strategies depending upon the priority of its corresponding objectives (in a GOS tree) as derived by the GO sub-House, its local importance weights (with respect to each of the GOS tree it represented), and its own effectiveness score. Using the House of Strategy, we have prioritized the strategies raised during the Delphi survey. The proposed methodology of building the House of Strategy can be used for designing strategies for an organization/industry using stakeholders' opinion and prioritizing them in order of their overall importance in achieving intended objectives and goals. Furthermore, the House of Strategy can be used as an effective communication tool to portray the goals, objectives, and strategies along with their priorities at one place.}

abstract = {The purpose for the analysis of capacity usage is to utilize the rail infrastructure in a more efficient and practical way. The practical and theoretical challenge of the rail capacity is its dynamics and uncertainty, which are common in China and elsewhere. Based on the capacity balance, a train service-demand intention set (TSDIS) at High-Speed Rail (HSR) line (t@l-TSDIS) is defined, which takes the number of trains, the average speed, the heterogeneity and the stability as the core elements for the capacity usage. For dynamics and uncertainty, we update the norm for capacity measure as the time needed to fulfill the task list t@l-TSDIS. Then we develop the objectives and constraints for the Mathematical Program for Line Capacity (MPLC), which aims at minimization of heterogeneity and running time as well as maximization of reliability. For solving MPLC, the Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategy (PAES) and fuzzy logic penalty function are introduced. Furthermore we propose a rolling optimization tactic oriented by the practical problem, which combines the improved Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategy (iPAES) with an interactive technique. In a case study, we apply the proposed ideas and methodology to Beijing-Shanghai HSR (BS-HSR) line much closer to the railway practice. By using the computer language C# to compile the Console program, Pareto optimized results for MPLC are achieved, including the standard and practical values for the heterogeneity indices, reliability indices and running time indices. We also discuss the sensitivity of the heterogeneity index. This research demonstrates that it is useful to analyze the line capacity usage for China HSR with the proposed optimization approach.}

abstract = {Designing products to fit human needs, preferences and capabilities is an essential key to competitiveness. In contested product markets, the management of user-related knowledge is therefore critical. Studies have shown that the identification and implementation of user requirements are significant issues for determining successful product development, especially during the conceptual design phase. User requirements represented in a single or limited level of abstraction is inadequate for effective incorporation into the conceptual design process. Such representation of user needs is argued here to be associated with issues such as the errors of problem framing, which is a cause of inadmissible, uncreative or sub-optimal designs. In this paper, a human-centric knowledge organization structure, Design Space Framework, is established to facilitate the consistent incorporation of user information into the length of the product conceptualization process. The role of this structure in human-centric design is illustrated in a case study.}

abstract = {This article introduces a Multi-Project Management Reference Model (GESMULTI,) designed to enhance project management performance. The reference model addresses the challenges associated with managing multiple projects concurrently, while efficiently utilizing shared resources. It provides practical guidelines for achieving effective multi-project management. The GESMULTI Reference Model includes essential management components such as Strategy, Portfolio, Resource, Stakeholder, Time, Risk, Cost, and Quality Management. Through the implementation of these components, operational improvements have been achieved, leading to increased efficiency in a real-world application case. One notable success of the model is the significant improvement in compliance with contractual project dates. Several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as OTD Ex-Works and PAC indicators have demonstrated impressive increases of 34.72% and 35.94%, respectively. Adopting the GESMULTI Reference Model has transformed the company’s multi-project management, providing clarity on projects and enhancing strategic alignment. These adaptable guidelines empower organizations to excel in a competitive business environment, enhancing multi-project management capabilities for greater success.}

The methodology embraces a decision making activity to be performed at different levels of detail and involving criteria with, sometimes, conflicting goals. In this contribution we focus on the development and implementation of a decision making process based on criteria accounting for the above mentioned issues. The developed multi-criteria decision making method is based on Quality Function Deployment and the Analytic Network Process, involving benefits, risks, opportunities and costs. The application of the method provides a more structured scenario for decision making processes in R&D and also forecasts the stability of the outcome with respect to changes in the decision making criteria and relevance of benefits, risks, opportunities and costs. To clarify and illustrate the steps of this method, it has been applied to decision making in a R&D environment.}

abstract = {Enterprises are challenged with fulfilling continuously changing customer requirements (CRs) that are influenced by many uncertain factors. Existing research only modelled the dynamics of CRs (DoCRs) by focusing on the potential resultant effects of CR changes, while lacking insightful exploration of the change characteristics of CRs themselves. To fill this gap, an online review-based DoCRs modelling method is proposed considering the lability and sensitivity of CRs by analyzing the changes in customers’ perceptions of product features over time. First, CRs in online reviews are extracted through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Second, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory is applied to measure customer sentiments in different periods towards specific product features. The probabilistic linguistic term sets are employed to characterize customer sentiment distributions which are then incorporated into the modelling of DoCRs. Third, a novel CRs classification cube is established by integrating the lability, sensitivity, and importance of CRs from an evolution-adapted perspective. Finally, the DoCRs of a smartphone is investigated as a case study to demonstrate and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Several managerial implications for the selection and adjustment of product development strategy are provided.}

abstract = {An intelligent boom sprayer (IBS) can realize efficient, precise and variable pesticides spraying operations on diverse crops and terrains by reconfiguring its hardware/software modules. Therefore, an ecological and reconfigurable design development strategy for IBS to get design goals, such as detachability, recyclability, maintainability, and reusability, will play a key role in ensuring the functions, service life and quality requirements of the product. After analyzing connotation and features of IBS,the Brownfield Process (BfP) was optimized to construct a Preferable Brownfield Process (P-BfP) which could achieve IBS ecodesign goals through analyzing the applicability and interference of IBS design and using Axiomatic Design (AD) as a main optimization theory role. The content identification and communication mechanism of the P-BfP were studied. The importance of existing resource reuse and standardization in the product design process for ecodesign was also highlighted. Dynamic models of BfP and P-BfP were built by using System Dynamics (SD) for providing a method to optimize the P-BfP design process. The simulation results showed that the P-BfP is more suitable for IBS design than the BfP from the time dimension by applying Vensim PLE and can improve the operating efficiency by 40% and reduce the training time by 50% while scientifically guiding the development of IBS. Finally, the feasibility of P-BfP was illustrated through comparing boom structure development result. The research results provide valuable scientific guidance for the ecodesign of reconfigurable modular products like IBS.}

Initially, AHP is applied to respondents to form a basis of market segmentation. Thereafter, with respect to identified segments, AHP and KM are employed to extract customer preference for design attributes (DAs) and customer perception of marketing requirements (MRs), respectively. Finally, by means of DEMATEL, the causal relationships between MRs and DAs are systematically recognized to uncover new ideas of next-generation products.}

abstract = {Product-service systems (PSSs) have been the subject of numerous prior studies, most of which focus on presenting PSS strategies from a customer-centric perspective. This study offers a different approach to proposing new PSS strategies based on promising services that companies can implement using existing technology capability. First, business ecology networks consisting of goods and services are constructed using the trademarks of technology-based firms. Second, link prediction methods were applied to anticipate promising services. Third, patents were analyzed to determine whether the services can be developed using existing technology capabilities. Finally, a PSS portfolio map for establishing new PSS strategies for the target product is presented. Promising services and new PSS strategies are suggested according to whether they can be implemented using existing technology capability. A case study on wearable audio devices demonstrated the applicability and feasibility of the proposed approach. Indeed, promising services, such as self-reservation services and health and medical services, are suggested. A systematic approach and its quantitative outcomes are expected to have significant implications in practice as a support tool for decision-making regarding PSS strategy development. In addition, the proposed approach contributes to the existing literature by suggesting the broader use of intellectual properties.}

In this note, we study the structure of right WV-rings R and show that, if R is not a right V-ring, then R has exactly three distinct ideals, 0⊂J⊂R, where J is a nilpotent minimal right ideal of R such that R/J is a simple right V-domain. In this case, if we assume additionally that RJ is finitely generated, then R is left Artinian and right uniserial with composition length 2. We also show that a strictly right WV-ring with Jacobson radical J is a Frobenius local ring if and only if the injective hull of JR is uniserial. Some other results are obtained in the connection with the Noetherian property of right WV-rings and related rings.}
