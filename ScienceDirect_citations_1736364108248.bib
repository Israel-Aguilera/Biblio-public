abstract = {The presence of Industry 4.0 national plans and the ever-increasing international competition are forcing companies to embark on digitalization projects of their industrial plants. Time and money, however, are a constraint and, in addition to that, there is a considerable lack of works in the academic literature with regards to specific models for the selection of digital technologies. Starting from our methodological framework, we developed a multi-criteria decision-making model for the digitalization of industrial plants. The model is based on both Fuzzy Logic and AHP and is combined with an existing hierarchical classification of digital technologies in an attempt to highlight the advantage of adopting similar and easily interconnectable technologies. Finally, the model is applied to a simple case study to test its validity.}

abstract = {In the product design, understanding consumer requirements (CRs) is essential due to the fact that it influences the success of the product. Currently, it has been recognized that consumer involvement in an open design (OD) environment is an effective way to reduce the gap between what is required by consumers and what companies can provide. In the process of OD, the initial CRs may shift as the consumers can influence each other, and it is a challenge to capture and evaluate dynamic CRs in OD. In this study, the dynamic relationship between consumers who participate in OD is discussed based on Nash equilibrium. Corresponding to the dynamic relationship, a novel approach is proposed to explore the crucial CRs from consumers’ perspective. Initially, the platform of OD is constructed on the Internet to collect the CRs and its evaluations. Thereafter, a similarity-based filtering method (SFM) is presented to filter out the most differentiated evaluations. Furthermore, to get the weight of the CR evaluated by consumers, an improved fuzzy Delphi method is introduced. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of excessive number of CRs, a dual-index evaluation method is put forward to control the opening degree of OD. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach, a product of smartphone is examined as a case study. The results confirm that the proposed approach is appropriate for capturing and evaluating dynamic CRs in OD.}

abstract = {The grain size characteristics and aging of beach sediments from six islands of the Yongle Atoll, South China Sea, were measured to examine the taphonomic degradation of coral clasts in sediment reservoirs of reef environments. Seventy-one beach sediment samples were collected from 22 transects on 6 islands for sediment characteristic analyses, and 16 bulk sand samples and 28 coral samples were selected for 230Th dating. The mean grain size and ages of coral clasts showed a significant negative correlation (F25 = −0.721, p = 0.01). A grain size age model was established to explain the taphonomic degradation mechanism of coral clasts over time, and an empirical relationship between the mean grain size and 230Th ages was obtained from the Yongle Atoll. The mismatch of the taphonomic clock by grain size data was analyzed, and it was mainly caused by the influence of sorting processes and the intrinsic morphology of coral skeletons that occurred at the early stage of the breakdown process. The application of the model to a nearby atoll island showed that for coral sediments with homogeneous taphonomic conditions, the predicted age was well matched with the measured age. This work presents a general framework for understanding coral clast degradation trajectories with time in taphonomic environments, and it provides a feasible method to predict the coral age independent of other dating methods.}

Choosing the right supplier can help businesses increase productivity, competitiveness in the market, and profits without having to lower the quality of the products. However, choosing a supplier is not a simple matter, it requires businesses to consider many aspects about their suppliers. Therefore, the goal of this study is to propose an integrated model consisting of two models: Fuzzy Analytics Network Process (Fuzzy-ANP) model and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) to solve the problem above. The Fuzzy-ANP model was developed to evaluate the weightings of the supplier selection criteria, and the WASPAS Model was used to rank the suppliers. An example of supplier selection in the coffee industry in Vietnam was studied to validate the model, namely 5 main criteria, with 16 sub-criteria, and 7 suppliers. The model test results show that the Fuzzy ANP and WASPAS integration model was suitable. In future, these developing models can apply to other industries or integrate with other models.}

However, as the most challenging parts of user-centered design, traditional methods are mainly focusing on determining the priorities of the evaluation criteria and forming the comprehensive value (utility) of the conceptual scheme, may not fully deal with the interaction and interdependent between the conflicts of interest among stakeholders and weigh the ambiguous influence on the overall design expectations, which results in the unstable decision-making results. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a cooperative game theory based decision model for device conceptual scheme under uncertainty. The proposed approach consists of three parts: first part is to collect and classify needs of end users and professional users based on predefined evaluation criteria; second part is using rough set theory technique to create criteria correlation diagram and scheme value matrix from users; and third part is developing the fuzzy coalition utility model to maximize the overall desirability through the criteria correlation diagram with the conflict of interests of end and professional users considered, and then selecting the optimal scheme. A case study of blood pressure meter is used to illustrate the proposed approach and the result shows that this approach is more robust compared with the widely used the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach.}

abstract = {This paper examined impacts of food aid on domestic food production employing a computable general equilibrium modelling technique and using data from Ethiopia. The simulation experiments have shown that food aid has unambiguous disincentive effects on domestic food production. The removal of food aid caused a modest increase in food prices but this stimulated food production. Employment and income generation effects of the latter outweighed the adverse effect of the former. Consequently, the removal of food aid led to improvements in aggregate household welfare. Contrary to some concerns in the food aid literature that any reduction in food aid would hurt the poor, the simulation experiments suggested that actually poor rural households and urban wage earners are the ones who benefit most in absence of food aid but entrepreneurs are more likely to encounter a marginal welfare decline. We have distinguished between in-kind food aid and cash equivalent transfers in order to isolate the disincentives that in-kind transfers would make to domestic production from those that are related to household purchasing power problem. The expansionary effect of removing food aid becomes significantly larger when it is accompanied by cash equivalent payments because the latter would provide demand side stimulus to agriculture while the removal of in-kind transfers would stimulate supply side, with the supply and demand side effects reinforcing each other. In our modelling framework, the only adverse effect would be a modest deterioration in the external current account, because the expansionary effects of food aid would cause imports to rise but exports to fall.}

We have identified four themes that synthesize the research on Quality Management and its support to approaches for sustainable development: (I) supporting sustainability through integration of management systems, (II) Quality Management as support to the implementation of Environmental Management Systems and to the management of sustainability, (III) supporting integration of sustainability considerations in daily work, and (IV) supporting stakeholder management and customer focus. By far the most research has been conducted within the first two themes. This paper also contributes with proposals for future research, such as the need to move beyond existing standards and management systems to enable more radical improvements, and the need for empirical evidence of the effect of integrated management systems on environmental performance. We also highlight the point that Quality Management practices and tools must be developed and adapted in order to support sustainability considerations.}

However, existing collaborative systems frequently face difficulties in establishing dynamic relationships with humans and adapting to evolving conditions, ultimately restricting their overall potential. This paper investigates the essential features required for collaborative workstations to enable SHRC. Moreover, with the aim of fully harnessing the power of collaborative robotics, the paper introduces a design methodology that supports the development of symbiotic workstations for specific assembly operations. A real-world case study is provided, demonstrating the practical implementation and benefits of the proposed design approach.}

abstract = {Even though technology transfer has been part of development aid programmes for many decades, it has more often than not failed to come to fruition. One reason is the absence of simple guidelines or decision making tools that help operators or plant owners to decide on the most suitable technology to adopt. Practical suggestions for choosing the most suitable technology to combat a specific problem are hard to get and technology drawbacks are not sufficiently highlighted. Western counterparts in technology transfer or development projects often underestimate or don’t sufficiently account for the high investment costs for the imported incineration plant; the differing nature of Chinese MSW; the need for trained manpower; and the need to treat flue gas, bunker leakage water, and ash, all of which contain highly toxic elements. This article sets out requirements for municipal solid waste disposal plant owner/operators in China as well as giving an attribute assessment for the prevalent waste disposal plant types in order to assist individual decision makers in their evaluation process for what plant type might be most suitable in a given situation. There is no ‘best’ plant for all needs and purposes, and requirement constellations rely on generalisations meaning they cannot be blindly applied, but an alignment of a type of plant to a type of owner or operator can realistically be achieved. To this end, a four-step approach is suggested and a technology matrix is set out to ease the choice of technology to transfer and avoid past errors. The four steps are (1) Identification of plant owner/operator requirement clusters; (2) Determination of different municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plant attributes; (3) Development of a matrix matching requirement clusters to plant attributes; (4) Application of Quality Function Deployment Method to aid in technology localisation. The technology transfer matrices thus derived show significant performance differences between the various technologies available. It is hoped that the resulting research can build a bridge between technology transfer research and waste disposal research in order to enhance the exchange of more sustainable solutions in future.}

abstract = {This study focuses on ways to systematically evaluate stakeholder requirements when developing a smart industrial service ecosystem (SISE) in a complex industrial context. The SISE development requires considering the service requirement from both the complex industrial context and service ecosystem manners. This study proposes a systematic framework for stakeholder requirement evaluation in SISE. The first part of the framework is the industrial context-viable system model with ecological thinking (IC-VESM) to elicit the service requirements for the SISE, which facilitates a systematic analysis of the service value proposition and service requirement elicitation in the operational lifecycle of an entire industrial context. This second part of the framework proposes a method for evaluating service requirements that is both feasible and systematic. This is achieved by combining the Fuzzy Kano and AHP methods in a Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) environment. The PF Kano computes the categories and determines the weights of service requirements from a consumer perspective, while the PF AHP hierarchically analyzes the service requirements and provides pairwise comparison paths for design experts. Finally, an illustrative case study in a renewable energy context was used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. The proposed theoretical model provides more reliable and systematic outcomes than traditional methods when eliciting service requirements and evaluating complex smart industrial service solutions. The study has practical implications by providing useful insights for companies to recognize key smart service requirements in complex industrial contexts and to improve sustainable development.}

This review analyzes 65 articles published in relevant journals, which are characterized in terms of several factors which are inherent to decision making in supplier development. The results show that most models focus on formulating SDPs, whereas the most common decision-making methods are Data Envelopment Analysis and Rough Set Theory. The use of multicriteria models and Fuzzy Sets has increased. The research gaps identified allowed us to propose some future research directions on the topic, calling attention to the need of developing new models considering elements that have not yet been studied in the literature, as well as performing comparative studies between them.

Until today, methodological approaches were not the subject of consideration, which aim to determine the status quo of a product with regard to various aspects, i.e. to evaluate the exact position of the product. This paper focuses on the methodological support of the position evaluation in product development; the results of such a position evaluation should in the scope of the product development methodology result in a search for objectives on a higher and more informed level of information. Both, the current work of the authors in the industrial product development as well as several retrospective analyses point to a clear need for a deeper and wider positioning. Important emphasis of the developed methodological approaches is the stimulation of abstraction in the case of existing products in order to avoid solution fixations in function and feature options. As a novel aspect the focus on optimal functional performance and optimal characteristics is proposed. Another main aspect is the inclusion of field experience and quality problems. Basically, qualitative and quantitative analyzes of the existing product are used as a basis, wherein, when possible, a quantification with respect to the monetary impact is attempted. As one key driver of cost and complexity the product variance is taken into consideration. The approaches have been developed and verified using the example of a compressor for the air supply for braking systems of rail vehicles and are explained on this example.}

abstract = {Increasing interest in low rank coal pyrolysis (LRCP) polygeneration has resulted in the development of a number of different technologies and approaches. Evaluation of LRCP processes should include not only conventional efficiency, economic and environmental assessments, but also take into consideration sustainability aspects. As a result of the many complex variables involved, selection of the most suitable LRCP technology becomes a challenging task. This paper applies a House of Quality method in comprehensive evaluation of LRCP. A multi-level evaluation model addressing 19 customer needs and analyzing 10 technical characteristics is developed. Using the evaluation model, the paper evaluates three LRCP technologies, which are based on solid heat carrier, moving bed and fluidized bed concepts, respectively. The results show that the three most important customer needs are level of technical maturity, wastewater emissions, and internal rate of return. The three most important technical characteristics are production costs, investment costs and waste emissions. On the basis of the conducted analysis, it is concluded that the LRCP process utilizing a fluidized bed approach is the optimal alternative studied.}

Blue innovation guidelines are translated into blue-design principles, which are further integrated into a design framework called CSDT (Complex System Design Technique). The case study from the field of consumer goods highlights both possibilities and challenges of blue-design to meet basic needs of consumers. It is also shown that structured innovation cannot totally solve the blue economy principles without further discoveries in science and technology.}

Under such circumstances, this article has proposed a value co-creation-oriented framework for smart PSS. Firstly, the structure model for smart PSS, to some extent, can cover three types of PSS. Secondly, the hierarchical value dimensions transcend the scope of traditional PSS. Furthermore, the co-creation opportunities in smart PSS are recognized. Then the value co-creation process including co-exist, co-design, co-implement and co-evaluate is proposed for smart PSS, and an illustrative case of smart fridge-service system (SFSS) is demonstrated.

The question is what practices are suitable for consideration? One set of practices and tools, deemed suitable due to its focus on long-term impacts and customer focus, is Quality Management. Within this area, the Robust Design Methodology has a historic connection to sustainability vis-à-vis quality loss caused by a product not only to an individual customer, but to society at large. Hence, there appears to be a neglected connection to the sustainability area. This paper explores how efforts based on the Robust Design Methodology may better contribute to sustainability and, more specifically, to sustainable product development. This paper reviews earlier Robust Design Methodology case studies that reveal how it supports sustainability. However, the reviews also reveal that efforts so far have focused only on the manufacturing and use phases of a product's lifecycle. Hence, adaptations of the methodology are needed, such as more conceptual and qualitative tools and explicit inclusion of eco-design indicators as a response variable in, for example, Design of Experiments. Adapting the Robust Design Methodology enables meeting the key aspects of an eco-design tool: addressing early integration of environmental aspects in development processes, having a lifecycle approach, and being a multi-criteria approach.}

It is an innovative attempt that design for six sigma (DFSS) is introduced to establish a model of above collaborative manufacturing system. In the DFSS-based modeling, in addition to establishing the basic framework, the related data-driven decision and optimization are proposed, respectively. The house of quality (HOQ) is firstly established to convert the voice of customer (VOC) into the critical to qualities (CTQs) and determine the geometric and physical evaluations. Then, the conventional machine setting modification is extended to the multi-objective optimization (MOO) modification considering both geometric and physical evaluations. The whole system is divided into the three data-driven sub-problems for their respective decision and optimization. First, the accurate measurement and compensation is used to operate the noise factors in the actual manufacturing. Second, a prescribed ease-off topography is identified as the target flank by MOO of the physical evaluations. An improved high-order modification of the optimal machine setting is performed to optimize the geometric performance. A case of study on measurement-modification-machining (3 M) collaborative manufacturing system is provided to verify the proposed model.}

Integrating end-of-life (EOL) considerations into the design of products will greatly facilitate the recovery of material/components at EOL, and enable their reintroduction into new product life cycles. Past research has largely employed qualitative or single objective oriented approaches for environmental product design. This paper presents a quantitative method for value recovery, in which disassembly bottlenecks are identified and removed by improving upon an existing design. The approach determines the value that can be recovered from EOL products through different EOL options. For a given EOL scenario, major bottlenecks are generally associated with joints, material incompatibility, and product architecture. Once the bottlenecks to rapid, cost effective dismantling of EOL products are identified, different design changes are considered to reduce the time/cost required to recover components/materials. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, a hard disk drive is used as a case study.}

This paper proposes a holistic cognitive conflict chain management framework (HCCCMF) to enhance quality customer service and supply chain management efficiency. This proposed HCCCMF method reduces interruption during the process and the cost of raw materials, labour, and energy in supply chain management. Behavioural monitoring analysis is carried out to improve quality service to consumers, creating an excellent customer-supplier relationship to function effectively in supply chain management. Policy matrix analysis is introduced to overcome disruptions during operation, which effectively manages affordable rates. The experimental results show that the proposed HCCCMF method enhances the productivity ratio of 94.3%, performance ratio of 98.4%, efficiency ratio of 96.5%, reliability ratio of 95.5%, accuracy ratio of 97.8%, and low trade cost ratio of 15.3% when compared to other existing methods.}

This activity generates a valuable source of knowledge about the manufacturing processes in the company. However, the sharing and reuse of this knowledge is a challenge, because usually the knowledge is not semantically organized, and therefore its meaning depends on the understanding of the specialists involved. Also, there is a high fragmentation and distribution of knowledge along the production chain. Considering this scenario, this paper presents the development of a system for distributed knowledge sharing and reuse in the PFMEA domain using an ontology based on description logics, which intends to allow knowledge inference and retrieval in manufacturing environments with distributed resources. The results show that the proposed approach is adequate to support knowledge sharing and reuse, allowing: (a) knowledge representation and organization; (b) distributed knowledge inference and retrieval; (c) management of organizational knowledge on manufacturing environments with distributed resources.}

How to extract critical opinionated sentences associated with some specific features from product online reviews has been investigated by some researchers. However, few of them examined how to employ these valuable resources for competitor analysis. Hence, in this research, a framework is illustrated to select pairs of opinionated representative yet comparative sentences with specific product features from reviews of competitive products. With the help of the techniques on sentiment analysis, opinionated sentences referring to a specific feature are first identified from product online reviews. Then, information representativeness, information comparativeness and information diversity are investigated for the selection of a small number of representative yet comparative opinionated sentences. Accordingly, an optimization problem is formulated, and three greedy algorithms are proposed to analyze this problem for suboptimal solutions. Finally, with a large amount of real data from Amazon.com, categories of extensive experiments are conducted and the final encouraging results are realized, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Introduction
Intravenous vancomycin is a frequently used antibiotic and a common cause of medication-related harm because of its narrow therapeutic range. Improving monitoring of drug levels with automation in the electronic health record (EHR) may decrease this harm.
Methods
After examining the existing state of vancomycin ordering, administration, and monitoring, an automated process was created in the EHR that, on initiation of a new vancomycin order, automatically ordered a vancomycin trough level 30 minutes before the fourth dose. In addition, a nursing alert was integrated into the bar coding medication administration process that, if no trough level had been drawn by the time of the administration of the fourth dose, prompted the nurse to draw a trough level. Data from a three-month, post-implementation period was compared to data from a preceding three-month period.
Results
The frequency of trough levels drawn between the third and fourth dose increased from 58.6% to 75.8% (p < 0.01). However, the percentage of trough levels drawn within one hour of the fourth dose remained unchanged, possibly because nursing staff waited for the result of the level prior to administering the next dose of vancomycin. A minority of patients in both groups had trough levels that were in range (difference between groups, p = 0.46).
Conclusion
Automation of vancomycin monitoring was associated with improvement in the frequency of monitoring and only delayed medication dosing by six minutes. Because vancomycin is high risk, this type of process should be broadly implemented, and outcomes should be assessed to identify unexpected outcomes and necessary further refinements.}

To better identify the common interests on sustainable development in this field, the Sustainability Solutions Navigator (SSN) was adopted in China for the first time to assess the sustainability needs and practices. Based on the participation of stakeholders from the government, businesses, academia, and non-government organizations, prioritized needs and practices were identified using SSN, and gap analyses were conducted for comparison to global benchmarks. According to the results, the top needs were mainly focused on improving government efficiency and implementation, maintaining healthy indoor environments and obtaining adequate funds; priority practices were mainly focused on governmental action, renewable energy development and pollutant source reduction. The gap analysis indicated that the government efficiency and performance had the largest gap to the benchmark. By using a simple interactive tool to bring different stakeholders into policy making process, this study produces all-around information for decision makers. The results imply that the sustainability of the building industry in China has a much better expectation than governmental performance.}

Given the scenario, investments in strategies to retain and develop high potential talents in the company increase competitiveness in the long term. The professional potential evaluation is an important TM practice, however there is no exact formula to identify an individual's potential, due to the different dimensions required. With this, the present article aims to contributes for fill a gap in the literature of multicriteria frameworks for potential evaluation, considering expert's behaviour and knowledge. The methodology was divided in three main points: 1) identify attributes and design a criteria structure for the potential evaluation with experts; 2) criteria evaluation by the experts, through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method; and 3) alternatives evaluation through the ELECTRE-TRI method, using the expert's knowledge defining the method's parameters. The results indicated a structure with 6 main criteria, its importance weights, and a professional potential evaluation, considering 3 classes: a) Hight Potential; b) Potential to Test; and c) Professional Maintainer. For the future of the research, one of the steps in the roadmap is consider other methos to do the evaluation and compare them.}

Anyway, its application is still far from real industrial scenarios mainly due to difficulties in choosing the right partners, lack of collaboration among the partners, poor integration among the companies’ system platforms, and lack of knowledge about the available technologies. In such context, this paper presents an integrated methodology to support the PSS design process into a Virtual Enterprise (VE). It involves different stages, from idea management to global network definition. Furthermore, the business model items can be defined in parallel along the design process and benefit the design itself by supporting decision-making, according to a concurrent engineering approach.In order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, it has been applied to a real industrial use case represented by a Virtual Enterprise working in the field of household appliances. In particular, the method supported the PSS design by the definition of the PSS requirements and functions, as well as the selection of the global network partners. The as-is and to-be processes are described and compared. The use case represents a valid example of how a product-oriented manufacturing company can open its strategic vision creating a PSS Virtual Enterprise in a structured way.}

The results of this survey show that innovative products offer customers “latent functions” that might otherwise escape their notice, and that some of them even solve “technical contradictions” that could crop up in the near future, and hence have a “great impact on society”. I think these features offer a direction in which TRIZ could proceed. However, detailed analysis indicates that assigning appropriate weight to the three features selected in this study of “big hits” is product-specific. This leads me to propose in this paper an “Innovation-oriented TRIZ approach”, which combines the TRIZ method, marketing techniques and functional analysis in VE to plan and develop innovative products systematically. To apply this approach effectively, I would like to define “the best type of product” from the standpoint of its affinity with this innovative approach. Based on these selection criteria, I surveyed the top 10 hits selected by “Nikkei TRENDY (a magazine specializing in top hits)” from the “30 biggest hits” released in Japan in the last 9 years (2000 to 2008). A “big hit” is defined as a commercial product recognized by many customers for its “new value”. “Innovation” is defined as creating “new things” (by Schumpeter). My theory, explored here, is based on the hypothesis that big hits, especially big hits in hardware, carry a high degree of probability to become innovative products.}

However, evaluating the ”greenness” of a manufactured product is a complex task due to data availability, varying definitions of ”green” products, and diverse environmental impacts. This research addresses this challenge by identifying, classifying, and prioritizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess green manufactured products, specifically within the Indian manufacturing context. A systematic approach was employed, incorporating Pareto analysis and the Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) to identify the most significant KPIs and assign them priority. Industry, academia, and customer perspectives were considered, resulting in distinct priorities. Industry experts prioritize economic aspects, while academia emphasizes health and safety. Customers focus on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. This diversity of perspectives underscores the need for businesses to tailor their sustainability strategies to meet evolving customer demands while considering economic implications. The study identifies 30 vital KPIs crucial for evaluating green product manufacturing, encompassing dimensions like waste management, energy efficiency, workplace safety, and societal compliance. By considering these KPIs, businesses can make informed decisions to improve sustainability, reduce their environmental footprint, and align with consumer expectations. The findings provide a roadmap for businesses and policymakers to develop more effective strategies, targeting diverse stakeholder groups and promoting the production and use of green products. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in sustainable manufacturing and serves as a valuable tool for manufacturers in India and beyond, aiding them in navigating the complexities of manufacturing green products and meeting the rising demand from environmentally conscious consumers.}

Therefore, suppliers need to be capable of being resilient to any disruption and providing sustainable supply. Supplier selection is a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem that allows suppliers to evaluate different and often conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria. Both resilient and sustainable supplier selection problems contain many qualitative criteria. Experts make subjective judgments based on qualitative criteria in the decision-making process. The D number is a method used to find an efficient and feasible solution to uncertain information. In this paper, the DAHP method, which integrates the traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the D numbers, is used for the resilient and sustainable supplier selection problem. The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is integrated into DAHP to determine criteria and subcriteria weights. The proposed integrated DAHP-DEMATEL model is implemented in an automobile manufacturing company to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The Triantaphyllou method is applied to perform sensitivity analysis. The traditional AHP-DEMATEL hybrid method was applied to the same problem, and sensitivity analysis was performed. The sensitivity analysis results of the hybrid method were compared with the results of the applied AHP-DEMATEL method. It can be said that the proposed model is less affected by subjective evaluations and is a robust method.}

Therefore, thermal insulation board selection has become an important issue. This study presents a combined fuzzy group decision-making approach that consists of the integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, the integrated intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, and intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution for effectively evaluating thermal insulation boards. However, since these three fuzzy decision-making methods can produce different rankings, decision-making is a complex and challenging process for decision-makers. In order to overcome this problem, correlation coefficient and standard deviation method is utilized to construct the final ranking by integrating these approaches using regression statistics, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients between the closeness coefficients of each alternative in the relevant approach. The proposed approach provides an accurate ranking of thermal insulation boards validated through a real-world case study. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the combinations of different levels of criteria and approaches affect the final ranking. According to the study’s findings, the gray expanded polystyrene foam is the most suitable thermal insulation board in the combined fuzzy group decision-making approach.}

This paradigm shift presents a challenge, as education and public sectors are typically not familiar with matured (project) management principles, and often follow the “Garbage Can- Model”(Cohen, 1964), while, simultaneously, industry experts lack experience and knowledge about the academic and public world. But both have to answer questions like: How can PM measure progress in an educational project? Which PM methods are most/least helpful? Using a case study approach to the research, this paper will analyze several highly visible and innovative stakeholder partnerships that are breaking traditional curriculum and assessment models. Using industry subject matter experts, both the Michigan Advanced Technician Training (MAT2) program have developed a competency- based curriculum that incorporates a sophisticated methodology of assessments using the industry-driven DACUM approach as the foundation. The new model requires a sophisticated methodology for tracking learning analytics including performance, completion rates, and learning gaps. This paper will propose a solution.}

Companies can leverage such data and gain valuable insight into their processes with Supply Chain Analytics (SCA) tools. The selection of the most appropriate SCA tool directly affects companies’ productivity since they allow enhancing visibility, obtaining informed decision-making and developing well-planned strategies for companies. A simple, practical, efficient and robust decision-making method can help select the most suitable SCA tool. Such a selection problem can be solved with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that consider different criteria. This paper proposes an SCA tool evaluation model which combines hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis, and the full multiplicative (MULTIMOORA). The HFLTS technique is applied for handling the uncertainty and hesitancy of experts’ views in the evaluation process. The weights of the six main selection criteria and their thirty sub-criteria are computed via the hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) AHP method. Then, the HFL MULTIMOORA method is combined with the fuzzy envelope technique for the first time in the literature to rank the eight SCA tool alternatives from different companies. A case study for a logistics firm illustrates the potential of the proposed evaluation model, which underlines the most important criteria to be the statistical power, product quality improvement, organizational performance enhancement, and service cooperation. It also ranks PeopleSoft as the most appropriate SCA tool for the case company. A comparative analysis with the HFL VIKOR method demonstrated that the proposed method is robust and consistent.}

abstract = {Technology innovation is critical for organizational and economic development and thus has been widely discussed. In spite of the extensive research, however, the research community has made few efforts to guide the direction of innovation, considering the general evolutionary patterns of technical systems. Therefore, this research suggests a novel approach to predict prioritized directions of innovation as well as to create the most promising design of practical concept design. For the purpose, firstly, we analyze the main functions of a target system using function analysis techniques. Then we develop an evolution opportunity map based on the Laws of Technical Systems Evolution in TRIZ, from which we generate the most suitable concept for a next-generation system. Finally, we analyze technical challenges that might arise in realizing the concept using Su-field analysis, which can help to obtain a feasible solution for it. Samsung Advanced Institute for Technology in Korea adopted the suggested approach to the new technology generation process, and verified its practicability and utility. We expect this research to be useful for those in charge of innovation management or new product development processes.}

It aims at considering the user's value proposition for Smart PSS in the dimensions of intelligence, sustainability, and society, while also ranking Smart PSS to support delivery risk management under uncertainty. However, related Smart PSS evaluation models advocate the use of multi-criteria decision models for obtaining the intrinsic value of PSS by ignoring the influence of the causality of criteria on Smart PSS design, which results in an unstable evaluation process. Additionally, the adaptiveness of Smart PSS has not been thoroughly explored, and determining the adoption intentions of Smart PSS can be challenging. To fill these gaps, a Smart PSS evaluation model that integrates a rough decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and a Bayesian network (BN) is proposed to support probabilistic reasoning for Smart PSS adaptiveness and reduce the risk of Smart PSS development. First, a set of 17 evaluation criteria is identified, and their causal relationships and weights of the criteria were identified using a rough DEMATEL under uncertainty. Second, a BN-based reasoning model for Smart PSS criteria is developed to evaluate the adaptability of smart PSS by constructing a conditional probability calculation model based on criterion weights. Finally, a multifunctional smart cooking center (MFSCC) case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The belief propagation analysis results revealed the key criteria affecting the MFSCC service system development and provided design strategies to improve the adaptiveness of the Smart PSS.}

In recent years, scholars had some efforts to enhance the capability of PSS with the support of artificial intelligence (AI) which is known as Smart PSS(SPSS). So far, most previous studies adopted a single model which cannot handle multiple tasks simultaneously that results in unsatisfactory services to customers. In addition, customer preference cannot be fully addressed to achieve personalization. Therefore, this study proposes a method that integrates multiple models into an SPSS with three steps: (1) Collect data and construct an appropriate object detection model. (2) Develop smart PSS solutions. Then, (3) Optimize the system based on feedback through Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide customers with personalized services. An attraction recommendation case study with experiment is designed to verify the proposed method. The results show that proposed SPSS can optimize the system in time according to the feedback of users, and provide better personalized services. This research is the first research that utilizes applied both text and image data to extract customer characteristics to better capture the voice of customers.}

This paper argues that methodological guidance, as well as tools for decision support, may be found in the research field of Value Driven Design (VDD), which originates in the realm of Systems Engineering. The paper objective is to elaborate on gaps and opportunities for cross-pollination between VDD and PSS. The results of a systematic review of methods and tools for design decision support highlight the opportunity for introducing optimization models derived from VDD in the PSS design process, while the latter can enrich VDD research with a more qualitative value assessment logic. The paper summarizes this integration in a methodological approach, and exemplifies its application in case studies mainly from the aerospace and road construction equipment sector.}

abstract = {At the present moment, global competition between companies is leading to a constant battle for an adequate market share and this is mostly not only achieved by reducing prices but rather more effectively by constantly introducing new innovations at all levels and across all functions in a company. Conceptions or ideas for new products derive either from external sources (customers or buyers, suppliers, competitors, patent documentation, research centres and educational institutions, chambers, associations and institutes, fairs and exhibitions etc.) or internal sources (managers, sales representatives, merchants and commercial travellers, associate professionals and technologists, designers, in-house innovators etc.) [10]. Companies in the technical field mostly acquire knowledge on the basis of researching a special group of buyers known as the “leading users”. These are the buyers who are the most advanced in terms of using a company's products and in comparison with others they identify possible improvements to products earlier. Companies use surveys, projective methods, group interviews as well as written customers’ suggestions and complaints to identify the needs and wishes of their customers. However, it has to be said that many of the best ideas evolve from the problems customers have with existing products [7]. The very core of VA is the effort to determine and eliminate those characteristics of products or services with no real value for the customer or the product, but which, nevertheless, cause costs in the production process or service delivery. Therefore, the VA process ensures a better product or service for the customer at minimal costs compared to replacing the existing product with a less favourable alternative. In the present article, the development of a new product is outlined in which the usefulness of two methods of innovative management – VA and conjoint analysis – was shown.}

There is a way to remove the trade-off between “rigor” and “use,” by applying industrial engineering (IE) tools that, though sophisticated and powerful, are packaged to facilitate use by people with relatively little specialized training. One level of IE use in evaluation simply adds tools to the evaluators’ toolbox. The second level employs the methodological abilities of evaluators to adapt and improve IE tools. Several problems must be solved in order to achieve the necessary integration. These include inserting the new evaluation technology into program settings, training and education, and developing a different kind of relationship between professional evaluators and those who work in settings where evaluation takes place.}

Application of quality management system within discreet and process industries is evident. However, there are limited studies that focused on the implementation of a quality management system (QMS) among SMEs operating in the food sector. This study explains the results of a feasibility study on FQMS among European Food SMEs. The objective of this study is to diagnose the status of the FQMS, and to find out what motivates and hinders the successful implementation of FQMS in SMEs. The findings show that none of the food SMEs involved in this study implements FQMS in its true form. The size of the company is a significant factor with respect to quality management implementation, as medium-sized companies were more mature in FQMS implementation compared to their small and micro counterparts. The confectionery, chocolate and meat sectors are more advanced than bakery, packaged fruits and vegetables sectors, with respect to the implementation of quality management tools and techniques. The study revealed that the most important benefits of a quality management system were reduction in cost of production and increased productivity. The key barrier to implementation of FQMS was “lack of knowledge and training” among food SMEs.}

The split-spectrum processing requires preliminary adjustments that are not always accessible to the user, while the cut-spectrum processing is not sensitive enough to eliminate the noise. We have thus developed an interesting alternative to these two filters. Based on the use of progressive low-pass filters, this algorithm, called low-spectrum processing, takes into account the physical characteristics of the ultrasonic wave propagation in a composite material. Its use in the inspection of tanks made in composites showed better performances.}

However, it is currently accomplished only for smaller systems where integrated packaged units are applied in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and other building services installations. The term ‘optimum modularity’ is rarely accurately used in the industry due to lack of an efficient modularisation method. In this investigation, an automated efficient modularisation algorithm has been developed using an approach which combines fuzzy logic, Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) and Hierarchical Clustering (HC) methods. The developed algorithm achieves minimum total installation cost by identifying the optimum number modules and module division points based on assembly cost and the handling cost of each module. It is shown that the optimum modularity for a system is highly dependent on the module dimensions and the module division point.}

For example, in a feature-based parametric CAD system, the product shape could be parameterized and thus altered with the change of parameters. However, without a consistent and systematic CAD modeling method, CAD models are not robust enough to capture functional design knowledge and cope with design changes, especially functional changes. A poorly constructed CAD model could result in erroneous or inconsistent design that requires a lot of expertise, manpower and repetitive computation to rebuild a valid and consistent model. The situation can be worse if the model is complex. The gap between functional design considerations and procedural CAD modeling demands an integrated CAD modeling approach. This paper proposes a functional feature-based CAD modeling method to guide designers building CAD models that are valid and yet agile to represent functional design considerations. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed research.}

In this study, the Jinsha River, the headwaters of the Yangtze River of China, was selected to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of hydrogeochemistry after the construction of six cascade reservoirs. Major ions, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and pH values of sampled water in the upper natural reaches and lower reservoir-regulated reaches were analyzed in both flood and dry seasons. The results of Piper diagram and Gibbs plots showed that the hydrogeochemistry of the Jinsha River was naturally controlled by both evaporation-crystallization and carbonate weathering processes, but it was also artificially affected by reservoirs. The impoundment of cascade reservoirs affected the hydrodynamic condition of the river. The river flow in the flood season was reduced by approximately 24.5%, altering the proportions of water sources and leading to notable hydrogeochemical alterations in reservoir-regulated reaches. Conversely, river hydrogeochemistry generally remained unchanged in the dry season, owing to the insignificant effect of cascade reservoirs on river flow. In contrast to what has been observed in previous studies of individual reservoirs, the cumulative influence of cascade reservoirs on the Jinsha River flow regime did not cause abrupt hydrogeochemical changes between the upstream and downstream areas of each reservoir. Moreover, the water quality assessments revealed that the impoundment of cascade reservoirs improved downstream irrigational water quality, with lower Na+ ratio values in the flood season. This study provides the earliest evaluation of cascade reservoir influence on the hydrogeochemistry of the Jinsha River. The findings of this study can be used as a reference for scientific guidelines for future environmental management of cascade reservoirs in large rivers.}

In the present paper, initial CRs are decomposed and categorized into functional customer requirements (FCRs), performance customer requirements (PCRs) and ECRs. Such an analysis is made based on the analysis of environmentally friendly products (EFPs), environmentally conscious customers, and the characteristics of their CRs, Furthermore, the decomposing method based on semantic analysis is given along with a developed quality function deployment for environment (QFDE) method. These methods create a shift from initial CRs to DFE oriented technical parameters (TPs). Finally, the acquisition and conversion of CRs of the automatic soybean milk maker in the DFE process is taken as an example to validate and analyze the above-mentioned method.}

The main contribution of this paper includes selecting and studying the popular MCDM techniques that uses different and wide ranges of data types in CEPs. A detailed study including advantages and pitfalls of using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) is introduced. Those two techniques are selected for the purpose of forming a package that covers most available data types in CEPs. The results indicated that AHP has a structure which simplifies complicated problems, while Fuzzy TOPSIS uses the advantages of linguistic variables to solve the issue of undocumented data and ill-defined problems. Furthermore, AHP is a simple technique that depends on pairwise comparisons of factors and natural attributes, beside it is preferable for widely spread hierarchies. On the other hand, Fuzzy TOPSIS needs more information but works well for the one-tier decision tree as well as it shows more flexibility to work in fuzzy environments. The two techniques have the facility to be integrated and combined in a new module to support most of the decisions required in CEPs.}

Concerning to support their decisions, different tools and methods are used by engineers and designers allowing to reduce uncertainty in design. Nevertheless, many of these decision support systems are focused in late design stages, such as detailed design and manufacturing design, even if the possibility to influence a new product is higher in early stages. The issues regarding to those situations are often associated to design processes related to multi-physics design, where the modification of geometric-related variables might affect the performance of the solution, and the analysis of tracking the influence of the modifications might generate reprocessing and loses of time, specially when those relations are tricky and are not easily identifiable by analysing equations and a manual analysis of requirements must be performed. This article is centred in proposing a traceability model for early design stages based in graph theory. The proposal supports the information generated in design, from the input requirements (linguistic field) up to mathematical modelling and variables definition (real numbers field). This information is arranged into different layers, allowing a multilevel approach in terms of information management. The model also features a novel solution for weighting vertex in graph model, featuring a model that balances the direction of improvement, the importance and flexibility of any specification and how its behaviour will affect the design variables associated to it. The goal of the proposed model is to offer to designers, since the conceptual design stage, a method that can show automatically the level of correlation between any pair variables and specifications by the use of information trees and featuring chains that can connect them whether there is or not a connection via equations.}

And this strategy is widely employed by company in order to shorten time to market and reduce costs. Aiming at the problem, a modular design method is proposed in this paper considering not only the environmental impact of product but also product platform planning strategy. The instability index of component is first presented to evaluate the change likelihood of component in future generations. Based on the instability index, the calculation method for the probability of product platform planning between product generations is illustrated. Next, a mathematical formulation for green modular design with consideration of product platform planning strategy is given. Moreover, for obtaining an optimal design scheme, a genetic algorithm is employed to conduct modular optimization. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study.}

A major function of FMEA is to evaluate, analyze, and determine the risk priority number (RPN) of each potential failure mode based on three risk assessment indices: severity, occurrence, and detectability in order to eliminate the potential risk. Unlike in conventional practice, where these indices are measured using discrete ordinal scales, this study adopts a 2-tuple linguistic computational approach to treat the assessments of the three risk indices and develop an FMEA assessment model to overcome the drawbacks of conventional RPN calculation. The house of quality (HOQ), a central tool of quality function deployment, is adopted to determine the more reasonable evaluations of the occurrence and detectability indices. The three risk indices are considered with different weights in the proposed model to obtain RPNs. Compared to conventional and fuzzy FMEA, the proposed FMEA model is more useful for determining practical RPNs for risk analysis and management in new product development (NPD). An example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.}

This article also addresses the key steps of the pre-experimental runs considering a consumer goods manufacturing process. Results of the application for an industrial case show that this methodology can support a clear definition of the problem and also a correct identification of the factor ranges in particular situations. The proposed new approach allows modeling the entire manufacturing system holistically and correctly defining the factor ranges and respective levels for a more effective application of DoE. This new approach can be a useful resource for both research and industrial practitioners who are dedicated to large DoE projects with unknown factor interactions, when the operational levels and ranges are not completely defined.}

abstract = {Many industries around the globe are opting for environment-friendly and intelligent solutions. In this regard, the materials and manufacturing sectors have also evolved beyond the fundamental requirements for industrial applications by incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. To promote carbon-neutral growth for sustainable production, green materials that can be reused and recycled have gained significant importance. Previous work on material selection has relied on parameters that either take crisp or ambiguous inputs. However, criteria based on the core concept of sustainability, such as environmental considerations, require uncertain or indeterminate expert assessments solved using single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs). For this reason, sustainable material selection necessitates the development of a unique framework to evaluate both crisp and ambiguous data concurrently without losing any information. In this work, a novel integrated framework combining method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) and measurement alternatives and ranking based on compromise solution (MARCOS) under the SVNSs environment is developed to assist designers in solving real-time engineering problems, taking inputs from three decision-makers. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, a case study for the material selection of a lightweight aircraft wing spar is considered. The criteria assessment factors used for the material selection are economic, structural, damage-tolerance, manufacturing, and environmental impact. To underline the advantages of the proposed methodology, a comparative analysis is carried out with distinct integrated frameworks. Furthermore, the findings of sensitivity analysis indicate that the suggested technique is an effective, efficient, and practical decision-making tool. The excellent correlation of the Spearman coefficient of the proposed approach with interactive and multiple attribute decision making (TODIM) and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) under SVNSs shows the legitimacy of the obtained ranking. The material selection tool is practical because it is developed using MATLAB and may be adapted to other applications with more criteria and alternatives.}

These Multiple and conflicting criteria often interact with each other, making the selection process cumbersome and challenging. Multi criterion decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used to handle these complexities, allowing consistent and effective decision-making and the selection of the best suitable supplier. This study utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) to evaluate suppliers and select the most suitable vendors for manufacturing companies. The proposed method first determines the vendor selection criteria and then uses the AHP to assess the relative relevance of the various criteria. The COPRAS method is used next to evaluate the alternative suppliers and select the most suitable vendor. A case study demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the method proposed in this study. As a result of the study, it has been shown that the AHP-COPRAS integrated method is an effective method that can be used in supplier selection and the decision-making process was analyzed in detail. Especially the most suitable supplier alternative was determined for a sector that requires precision parts production. In addition, by explaining the methods step by step, it was aimed to guide them so that they can be used in similar decision problems.}

The most recent advancement in the conceptual development uncovered different extents of complementarities occurring between product and process innovation at the project level. Prior literature suggested that facilitating a better interplay between these two types of innovation holds the potential for the development of a long-lasting competitive advantage. Despite its theoretical and managerial importance, management of new product and process development (NPPD) projects with different extents of complementarity between product and process innovation remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we adopt perspectives from contingency theory and dynamic capabilities. Building upon Hullova, Trott and Simms’s (2016) classification of complementarities we investigate the management of different complementarity types in four NPPD projects in the UK food and drink industry. We introduce empirically derived framework for effective management of NPPD projects with different extents of complementarity between product and process innovation. The framework identifies three critical capabilities and associated activities; 1) identifying the complexity and novelty of the project and assessment of internal and external resources and knowledge stocks, 2) deploying the most suitable integration mechanism(s) for the identified complementarity type and 3) leveraging of the knowledge learned and experience acquired during the project. Jointly, these three intertwined capabilities act as a complementarity management tool for product and process development managers, enabling them to manage their NPPD projects portfolios more effectively.}

Previous studies have analyzed the SCM features impacting organizational performance independently of the design of TQM practices. Similarly, the recent literature on SCM overlooks TQM when incorporating lean and agile elements in SCM practices and strategies. Scattered attempts have been made to evaluate lean and agile SCM practices and TQM action plans, but no concrete integrated approach has been developed. In particular, no study has presented a structured analysis to quantify the influence of the SCM components on achieving predetermined TQM goals. We propose a comprehensive, four-phase, integrated procedure with a total score to quantitatively assess lean and agile SCM to fill this research gap. This comprehensive score selects the most suitable TQM action plan for increasing productivity and sustainability. The four phases of the proposed procedure include an initial qualitative analysis for defining indicators, sub-indicators, and characteristics of the lean and agile approach (Phase 1), the formulation of a mathematical model for computing the total score of the whole SCM approach (Phase 2), the selection of an action plan to achieve TQM goals (Phase 3), and the validation of the proposed framework and the results obtained (Phase 4). We show the applicability of the proposed evaluation procedure in a real-life case study and demonstrate that the general formulation of the mathematical model allows for extensions of the proposed method to other evaluation contexts.}

Applications to the construction of efficient algorithms and to the theory of context-free sets of graphs follow naturally. The class of recognizable sets depends on the signature of graph operations. We consider three signatures related respectively to Hyperedge Replacement (HR) context-free graph grammars, to Vertex Replacement (VR) context-free graph grammars, and to modular decompositions of graphs. We compare the corresponding classes of recognizable sets. We show that they are robust in the sense that many variants of each signature (where in particular operations are defined by quantifier-free formulas, a quite flexible framework) yield the same notions of recognizability. We prove that for graphs without large complete bipartite subgraphs, HR-recognizability and VR-recognizability coincide. The same combinatorial condition equates HR-context-free and VR-context-free sets of graphs. Inasmuch as possible, results are formulated in the more general framework of relational structures.}

abstract = {Product competitiveness is highly influenced by its related design specifications. Information retrieval of customers preferences for the specification determination is essential to product design and development. Big sales data is an emerging resource for mining customers preferences on product specifications. In this work, information entropy is used for customers preferences information quantification on product specifications firstly. Then, a method of information mining for customers preferences estimation is developed by using big sales data. On this basis, a density-based clustering analysis is carried out on customers preferences as a decision support tool for the determination and selection of product design specifications. A case study related to electric bicycle specifications determination using big sales data is reported to illustrate and validate the proposed method.}

abstract = {ACI Pharma spends $ 12 to 15 million yearly to promote its brands. The brand promotional activities of the company were hampered, due to supplier selection subjectively, which impacted market share. The study selects the best supplier with supplier management and purchasing policy for printing materials for ACI Pharma based on objective judgments. The required data has been collected from the company. This study uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to address supplier selection and management problems. Five attributes, cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, and communication, and ten suppliers have been evaluated to select the best supplier. Spark Printers is the best supplier for ACI Pharma as it obtains the highest score, 0.968, whereas Marvelous Printers Limited and Lutfur Enterprise are the second-best and third-best suppliers. The application of AHP in the pharmaceutical supply chain industry is very limited. Further, Previous studies emphasized supplier selection rather than management and purchasing policy. Moreover, industry practitioners, especially in developing countries, might not use complex methodologies due to time, money, or technical constraints. Considering these thoughts, this study is conducted to select and manage the right supplier with purchasing policy using AHP in industry-friendly language and analysis patterns. Other organizations suffering from similar problems, such as ACI Pharma, may benefit from this research. The study has selected AHP, purposively, without any methodological justifications, although many Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques are present. Further studies might be conducted to find which MCDM method fits best to address the supplier selection problem in the pharmaceutical supply chain industry.}

With the growth rate slowing down, this poses challenges for the development impetus of the fertilizer industry in the next period. In fact, over the past few decades, Vietnam’s crop industry has abused excessive investment in chemical fertilizers, with organic fertilizers are rarely used or not at all, limiting crop productivity, increasing pests and diseases. To develop sustainable agriculture, Vietnam’s crop industry must limit the use of chemical fertilizers, increase the use of environmentally friendly organic and natural mineral fertilizers to produce clean agricultural products which is safe. Therefore, it is necessary to consider and choose the right supplier to ensure the goal of sustainable development. Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP), and the combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) are new Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) method which can be used to solve supplier selection problem. This paper uses an effective solution based on a combined the concept of triple bottom line (TBL), SF-AHP and CODAS approach to help agriculture companies that need to select the best fertilizer supplier. This research can support supply chain managers to achieve supply chain systems that reduce not only sourcing costs, but also develop sustainable agriculture.}

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering which aims at the development of a whole range of products. However, as long as SPL can be useful, there are many challenges regarding the use of that approach. One of the main problems which hinders the adoption of software product line (SPL) is the complexity regarding product management. In that context, we can remark the scoping problem. One of the existent ways to deal with scoping is the product portfolio scoping (PPS). PPS aims to define the products that should be developed as well as their key features. In general, that approach is driven by marketing aspects, like cost of the product and customer satisfaction. Defining a product portfolio by using the many different available aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents an improved hybrid approach to solve the feature model selection problem, aiming at supporting product portfolio scoping. The proposal is based in a hybrid approach not dependent on any particular algorithm/technology. We have evaluated the usefulness and scalability of our approach using one real SPL (ArgoUML-SPL) and synthetic SPLs. As per the evaluation results, our approach is both useful from a practitioner's perspective and scalable.}

To demonstrate results, we gathered actual customer complaints from the service operation of a target company. Using this data, the system pinpointed problematic areas where complaints happened (one-dimensional analysis), the relationship among problems (two-dimensional analysis), and the root cause of problems (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis).}

abstract = {Design decision-making is a vital activity for selecting an optimal scheme for product development. Owing to the uncertainty and ambiguity of design requirements and constraints, several product design phases are often deployed for concept refinement, which makes multistage product design decision-making (MPDDM) and the effective fusion of MPDDM data indispensable. However, few existing methods have considered the nonlinear relationships among the MPDDM information. Therefore, a nonlinear fusion method for MPDDM was proposed in this study. This method applies a three-parameter interval grey number to depict decision-makers’ judgement about product design schemes. Based on converting linguistic judgements into interval scales, an interval analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed to calculate the weights of the design criteria, decision-makers, and decision-making stages. Considering the advantage of integrating multiple matrices without requiring external control parameters, a multistage decision-making fusion process using a plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA) was proposed to aggregate multistage decision-making data for product design. A case study was conducted to collect multistage decision-making data, and the PGSA was developed. Through comparison with the extant method, the effectiveness and feasibility of the fusion of MPDDM was verified. The results indicate that (1) uncertainty perceived by decision-makers at three stages accounted for 96.7%, 95%, and 97.2%, respectively. The “center of gravity” of a three-parameter interval grey number, which reflects the largest possibility of decision-makers’ preferences, is not always equally distant from its maximum or minimum value (73.9%). (2) The optimization model using interval AHP to calculate the weights of decision-making indicators and stages is conducive to reducing the decision-maker’s uncertainty. (3) The global search mechanism of the PGSA can effectively realize the nonlinear fusion of MPDDM.}

In this paper we show that current variety-modelling methods miss a customer representation: without a proper assessment of the customers is not possible to define the product variety that has to be developed to meet the requirements of a customer segment. Here we present an innovative approach to rationalise the product variety, i.e. to link each product variant to the customer profile who needs it. The aim is to optimise the product variety avoiding excesses (variants not related to a customer), lacks (customers not related to a variant) or redundancies (two or more variants proposed to a customer). An overview of customer modelling approaches in the classic product design (non-customisable) is presented. The innovative approach is here developed using system-thinking concepts. A knowledge-based system that uses this approach is designed. Finally the approach is explained using a real industrial case of a quasi-real coil design process.}

abstract = {In the early stages of system of systems (SoS) meta-architecture concept development, it is greatly beneficial to have a formal method of architecture assessment to ensure compliance to stakeholder needs and requirements. Key performance attributes (KPAs) and key functional attributes (KFAs) are linguistic terms that represent the non-functional and functional requirements of the architecture. KPAs and KFAs can be assessed and converted into numeric values that can be used as fuzzy inputs to Mamdani-type rule based fuzzy inference systems (MRBFIS) to make fuzzy assessments of SoS meta-architecture concepts. This paper details an application of an assessment model featuring the integration of two separate MRBFISs; each with five inputs, five membership functions (MFs), twenty five If-Then rules, and a single output that is determined by the fuzzy rule base. Each unique MRBFIS used in the assessment was developed using the MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Designer application. The numeric outputs of each MRBFIS were then combined to provide an integrated KPA and KFA total architecture assessment score. The assessment model detailed in this paper provides a formal method of architecture assessment to be used in conjunction with trade space exploration, systems scoping, and the concept generation phase. This assessment model may help prevent costly project failures, system ambiguity late in development, unacceptable risks, cost overrun, and the inability to develop critical systems.}

A yeast-based liquid culture assay that measured time-dependent turbidity enabled the high-throughput screening of different Saccharomyces cerevisae strains to identify HSP modulators with unique molecular mechanisms. A focused set of four strains, with differing sensitivities to Hsp90 inhibitors, was used to screen a compound library of 3680 compounds. Computed turbidity curve functions were used to classify strain responses and sensitivity to chemical effects across the compound library. Filtering based on single-strain selectivity identified nine compounds as potential heat shock modulators, including the known Hsp90 inhibitor macbecin. Haploid yeast deletion strains (360), mined from previous Hsp90 inhibitor yeast screens and heat shock protein interaction data, were screened for differential sensitivities to known N-terminal ATP site-directed Hsp90 inhibitors to reveal functional distinctions. Strains demonstrating differential sensitivity (13) to Hsp90 inhibitors were used to prioritize primary screen hit compounds, with NSC145366 emerging as the lead hit. Our follow-up biochemical and functional studies show that NSC145366 directly interacts and inhibits the C-terminus of Hsp90, validating the platform as a powerful approach for early-stage identification of bioactive modulators of heat shock–dependent pathways.}
