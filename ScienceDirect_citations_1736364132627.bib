abstract = {Economic growth and ecological problems motivate industries to apply eco-friendly technologies and equipment. However, environmental impact, followed by energy and material consumption still remain the main negative implications of the technological progress in process engineering. Based on extensive patent analysis, this paper assigns more than 250 identified eco-innovation problems and requirements to 14 general eco-categories with energy consumption and losses, air pollution, and acidification as top issues. It defines primary eco-engineering contradictions, in case eco-problems appear as negative side effects of the new technologies, and secondary eco-engineering contradictions, if eco-friendly solutions have new environmental drawbacks. The study conceptualizes a correlation matrix between the eco-requirements for prediction of typical eco-contradictions on example of processes involving solids handling. Finally, it summarizes major eco-innovation approaches including Process Intensification in process engineering, and chronologically reviews 66 papers on eco-innovation adapting TRIZ methodology. Based on analysis of 100 eco-patents, 58 process intensification technologies, and literature, the study identifies 20 universal TRIZ inventive principles and sub-principles that have a higher value for environmental innovation. The presented research work belongs to the European project “Intensified by Design platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling” (IbD, http://ibd-project.eu), funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 SPIRE programme.}

abstract = {In 1991, attainment of independence in Slovenia caused a drastic decrease in the domestic market for Slovenian companies. The companies which did not adapt to the new market conditions were destined for ruin. In this time several smaller companies were established which could adapt to new market conditions more easily. When these companies entered the world market they encountered several difficulties such as excessive flow times for development of new products. After a survey of available literature had been made it was found that those problems could be solved by transforming sequential engineering to concurrent engineering. The article presents the principles of sequential and concurrent product development processes. The market forces small Slovenian companies to a transition from sequential to concurrent engineering and as team work is the basic element of the concurrent engineering, special attention has been paid to workgroups forming in the loops of concurrent product development process in small companies. A survey of published works in the field of planning teams in big companies has revealed that a three-level team structure is recommended in big companies. Analysis of the three-level structure has led us to the conclusion that a two-level team structure and matrix organisation should be preferred in small companies. Presented are the results of planning a two-level team structure and matrix organisation of a small Slovenian company which produces mini-loaders.}

abstract = {Environmental issues due to emerging markets and rapid development of consumer goods’ consumption require a new model to design more sustainable products. While traditional eco-design methods (LCA, Check-lists, Guidelines, DfX tools…) are generally restricted to a local optimization of the product or to macro-rules for defining an environmental strategy, this article presents an eco-innovative method based on product upgradability which is the integration of functional enrichments on the product. Indeed, the integration of upgrades offers new opportunities for facilitating the dissemination of the remanufacturing approach, the dissemination of Product-Service Systems, or for increasing the lifetime of product. This article presents an eco-innovative method based on upgradability consisting in: exploring the potential upgrades of modules - PMoL (SADT activity A4), the potential value network structures for upgradability - VaNS (A3) and the potential serviceable upgrades including eco-learning strategies - SMoL (A5). This method combines then the results PMoL, VaNS and SMoL to form promising Upgradable Modules Scenarios – UpMoS (A6), which are completed by the specification of an associated value network (A7) and the consolidation of eco-usage services and services offers (A8). The final result obtained, Upgradable systems concepts– UpSys are then assessed thanks to a multicriteria approach (A9) considering environmental, economic and user's and stakeholder's attractiveness criteria. To summarize, this method is structured in two rounds. The first round (A3, A4, A5) aims to explore widely the possibilities offered by the upgradability avoiding the complexity of an approach dealing with several parameters simultaneously. The purpose of the second round (A6, A7, A8, A9) is to specify and assess Upgradable systems encompassing the overall results of the exploration. Before performing this work, relevant information needs to be collected for the project (market information, customer segments, technologies, stakeholders, environmental impacts of the current product, etc.) and acceptability domains of upgradable systems have to be analyzed (A1, A2). This paper presents therefore this eco-innovative approach based on five founding principles and answering to the requirements identified in the literature for a good and effective eco-design method.}

The study is based on data from 4 focus groups. To identify that needs data are analyzed through the QFD VOC. Engineering requirements are translated with HOQ. To explore perceptions data are analyzed using a content analysis methodology with MaxQDA10 software©. Within the context of designing vehicles to comply with European regulations on CO2 emissions, the results reveal latent needs in human dimensions of the product. The notion of a reconfigurable vehicle was identified as a latent need for different target markets. Stated barriers for the adoption of this particular vehicle do not fully overlap with what individuals ponder when they consider buying a current fuel-based. Educational background was found to contribute for the receptivity of the disruptive proposal.}

Compared with the traditional product service, the SPS have more complicated interactions between the service components due to the novel characteristics caused by the application of smart technologies. The SPS modularization presents great differences from the identification of service component, correlation evaluation and module partition with the traditional product service modularization. However, most the existing research mainly focuses on the context of traditional product service, while containing scant study of smart product service. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid framework for SPS modularization. In the framework, a cyber-physical product service blueprint is firstly proposed to represent the SPS operation process and identify the SPS components. Then, a rough-fuzzy correlation matrix is presented to determine the comprehensive interdependence between all pairs of SPS components with fully considering the hybrid decision uncertainties involved in the evaluation process, i.e., intrapersonal linguistic vagueness and interpersonal preference diversity. After that, the complex network theory is used to construct the SPS network and a modified Girvan-Newman algorithm is adopted for the SPS module partition. Finally, an illustrative modularization case of smart gearbox maintenance service and some caparisons with other methods demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.}

The Kano's attractive service attribute is deemed to be a significant emotional booster (known as Kansei). Kansei Engineering (KE) is used to highlight the level of customer emotional satisfaction due to perceived service offerings. For the past seven years, there has been a rapid concern in Kansei Engineering (KE) in services. However, previous research of KE has mainly focused on the improvement and analysis of general service domains. There is little attention to sustainable services. Hence, this study provides a modified KE-based approach and aims to understand and satisfy customer emotional needs (Kansei) considering the social, environmental and economic performance. An empirical study in an international airport lounge and lobby services was conducted to confirm the applicability of the proposed model. Purposive sampling through in-depth-interview and face-to-face questionnaires which involved 100 valid subjects was used. Theoretically, these studies show the importance of Kansei's role in sustainable service development, highlighting more innovative and breakthrough solutions with less contradiction and “true-meaning” of Kansei. Practically, it provides a guideline for service designer and manager in identifying which attractive-based service attributes need to be prioritized considering Kansei satisfaction.}

Each component/sub-component used in one-shot systems, regardless of how it is supplied, has a specific risk level. On the other hand, each component affects the factors influencing the total system failure. It is the main objective of the present paper to provide a multi-objective model for determining suppliers of components used in one-shot systems. In this model, the risk associated with each supplier is initially estimated using risk assessment indicators. In the second stage, the risks associated with sub-components are assess using cause-and-effect matrices. Based on the likely catastrophic incidents to the system, the fault tree analysis is used and the relevant diagrams are drawn to identify the best composition of equipment suppliers. The results obtained from a case-study are then used in the especially developed multi-objective model to identify the allocations. The optimum values for the first and second objective functions are calculated to be 1489.349 and 0.809, respectively. Finally, the performance of the model is validated by sensitivity analysis.}

In such inter-organizational cooperations, business partners depend on each other's knowledge and bring in different types of expertise. In our research we focus on the knowledge exchanges across knowledge boundaries in inter-organizational activities for innovation. Information systems (IS) play an important role as enablers in this context. The concept of boundary objects has been used to describe interactions between actors with varying information and knowledge needs. While the vital role of boundary objects has been recognized in IS literature, the process of emergence of boundary-spanning has received less attention. Recent literature has hinted that, contrary to initial conceptualizations, boundary objects may not manifest as only single information technology artifacts. In this study, we offer the view of boundary objects as a cluster of several artifacts. By means of a qualitative case study, we describe the process of emergence of such boundary clusters and provide evidence for how they advance inter-organizational innovation activities. We describe how such clusters emerge from differences and dependencies in the knowledge of cooperating actors and explore the clusters' significance to knowledge exchanges in inter-organizational innovation contexts. In doing so, we offer an explanation of cluster emergence which links the interplay of artifacts, uses, practices, and knowledge to the coordination of cooperative inter-organizational innovation activities.}

Greenberg H, Duarte-Gardea M, Quezada OR. Implications regarding atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among women residing in a US–Mexico border city. Int J Gynecol Cancer 2006;16:1014–1016. We conducted a study of Mexican American women living in a US–Mexico border city who attended a gynecology clinic for Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. The objective of this study was to describe the cytologic outcomes of women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) diagnosis after a Pap smear and to observe any changes during follow-up colposcopy. A total of 852 abnormal Pap smear were identified through a computer search for a 6-month period. Histology data were available for 317 cases. Benign findings were observed in 45.4% of cervical biopsies. A clinically significant diagnosis was reported in the remaining tissue sample. The diagnosis report was either single or combined and recorded as follows: human papilloma virus 46.3%, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 23.6%; CIN 2, 5.6%; and CIN 3, 1.5%. There was one case of invasive cervical cancer. Overall, the incidence rate of ASCUS was 5%. However, we found that a significant proportion of this population had CIN 1 through CIN 3. Furthermore, this population has traditionally been noncompliant and routinely failed to attend follow-up appointments. Based on these results, the clinician should not ignore an initial abnormal Pap smear. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to perform colposcopy in Mexican American patients with a first time diagnosis of ASCUS on routine Pap smear.}

However, complex multigenic relationships and substantial genotype–environment interaction underlie plant architecture, and will hinder the efficient improvement of these traits in conventional cotton breeding programs. An enhanced understanding of the molecular-genetic regulation of plant morphological developmental can aid in the modification of agronomically relevant traits. In this study, an interspecific Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense BC1 population was used to identify QTL associated with plant architectural traits. Twenty-six single QTL were identified for seven plant architecture traits. The phenotypic variation explained by an individual QTL ranged from 9.56% to 44.57%. In addition, 11 epistatic QTL for fruit branch angle (FBA), plant height (PH), main-stem leaf size (MLS), and fruiting branch internode length (FBI) explained 2.28–15.34% of the phenotypic variation in these traits. The majority of the interactions (60%) occurred between markers linked to QTL influencing the same traits. The QTL detected in this study are expected to be valuable in future breeding programs to develop cultivars exhibiting desirable cotton architecture.}

To evaluate the applicability of an evidence-based video intervention to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening among African American men with different levels of health literacy.
Methods
Forty nine African American men participated in interviewer-administered, pretest and posttest interviews between January and March 2008. Health literacy status was assessed with the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), McNemar or binomial distributions were computed to assess pretest and posttest differences in knowledge. Descriptive statistics were produced to describe participants' perceptions of the information presented in the video.
Results
Results indicated that men with functional health literacy had higher mean levels of prostate cancer screening knowledge at baseline than men with inadequate health literacy. The between-group (F2,44= 4.84; p= .013) and within-group (F1,44= 5.16; p= .028) test results from repeated-measures ANCOVA indicated that preexisting group differences in prostate cancer knowledge had lessened after intervention exposure. Nearly all men rated the information presented in the video as credible (98%), trustworthy (96%), interesting (100%), understandable (94%), and complete (96%).
Conclusions
Results from this exploratory study suggest that the video intervention is suitable for use with African American men with different health literacy characteristics in 2 counties in the greater Florida panhandle region. More research is recommended to evaluate the impact of the intervention on men's intentions to undergo screening and actual screening behavior.}

Most current works view customers as being outside the supply chain design; however, we believe that customers are the missing link in the supply chain. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the customer's role in the process. We present an original discussion of the emerging discipline of services science, management, and engineering (SSME) in SCM, identify and bridge the gaps between SSME and SCM, as well as discuss ways to align them.

The proposed methodology conceptualises a framework of network uncertainty metrics and applies a set of fuzzy-based techniques (fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS)) to evaluate levels of fuzziness for transitions from traditional product-focused operations towards service-oriented operations. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study of a stainless steel manufacturer and the limitations and generalisation potentials of the research are used to highlight future research challenges for service-oriented uncertainty evaluation.}

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have found that Latinos who smoke are less likely than non-Latino white smokers to use pharmaceutical aids such as nicotine replacement therapies or to receive physician advice to stop smoking. This qualitative study further explored barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation among Latino adults in Maryland.
Methods
Five Spanish-language focus groups were conducted in September 2008 in Maryland with Latino current smoker and ex-smoker men and women (n = 55). Participants were recruited through flyers, information sheets, and site visits at community health clinics and Latino events, and were predominately of Central American origin.
Results
Personal health concerns were the main reason to quit smoking; impact on children and family health and role model pressure were frequently mentioned. Barriers to quit smoking included environmental temptation and social factors, emotional pressure, addiction, and habitual behavior. Respondents mostly relied on themselves for cessation, with little use of cessation products or other medications, or awareness of available services.
Conclusions
Social influence serves both as a strong motivation for Latinos to quit smoking and as a source of temptation to continue smoking. Favored by both current smokers and ex-smokers, lay health promoters are effective agents to reach Latinos with smoking cessation interventions. In addition, the low use of cessation services could be improved by increasing awareness and availability of Spanish-language cessation services.}

abstract = {Context: Software process improvement (SPI) aims to increase the effectiveness of a software organization. Many studies indicate that the strategic alignment is a critical factor for the SPI success. However, little is known about practical approaches to achieving and maintaining such alignment. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the validation evidence of the existing approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. Method: We develop a search protocol that combines database search and snowballing to perform the systematic literature review and evaluate empirical studies by applying rigor and relevance criteria. To evaluate the efficiency of our protocol, we use a “quasi-gold standard” to compute the sensitivity and precision of the search. Result: We identified 30 studies (18 empirical) and 19 approaches to strategic alignment of SPI from 495 retrieved studies. Only three out of the 18 empirical studies were rated as high in the categories rigor and relevance, suggesting the need for a stronger validation of the approaches. Conclusion: We conclude that the lack of empirical validation indicates that the results of the existing approaches have not been adequately transferred to practitioners yet, calling for more rigorous studies on the subject.}

The surge in related medical research activities over the last couple of years has triggered a demand for technology with the capability of generating and measuring ionizing radiation at ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR). A reliable dosimetry system is an integral part of a radiotherapy machine. Because existing active dosimetry methods are unable to handle the dose-rates required for FLASH, UHDR dosimetry has emerged as an important area of research. In this paper we present an active dosimetry method based on a scintillating screen and an integrating current transformer. This method provides a simultaneous measurement of the absolute dose delivery as well as the 2D dose distribution. The measurements have been correlated with corresponding readings from radiochromic films (RCFs), and a procedure for image processing has been established. Moreover, different methods of calibrating the active dosimetry system against RCFs have been introduced and evaluated. Lastly, we present results which demonstrate that an agreement with RCFs of better than 5% can be realistically expected if camera parameters are carefully optimized.}

In this paper, an in-process machine vision monitoring of tool wear is integrated into a production system based on the CPS approach. Thereby, a methodology of four phases is proposed, whose goal basically is to raise the requirements, validate the integration, develop the decentralized architecture and finally prove the efficiency, robustness, and capabilities that only cyber-physical systems can bring to a production system. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed monitoring system for in-process tool wear is validated in a CNC drilling machining process.}

Opting for suitable second-hand LNG vessels is a significant and efficient strategy for managing transportation operations effectively and meeting industry standards. Given LNG tanker specifications and shipbuilding capacity, the second-hand LNG tanker market adequately meets maritime industry demands. Thus, there is a strong motivation to evaluate the current second-hand vessel market. However, uncertainties prevail, necessitating decision-makers to employ a resilient and practical methodological framework to address uncertainties and complex decision-making scenarios effectively. This study proposes a decision-making framework integrating the Delphi and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) methods, leveraging interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). This framework resolves real-life challenges associated with selecting second-hand LNG tankers, demonstrating the practicality of the approach. Using IT2FSs, the Delphi method identifies critical criteria influencing second-hand tanker vessel selection. “Cargo carriage capacity" emerged as the most influential criterion, followed by "purchasing costs" and "year of construction." Moreover, "Mediterranean Energy" was deemed the most suitable second-hand LNG tanker among the six alternatives assessed. Thorough sensitivity analysis validated the proposed model and its implications, confirming its validity and applicability.}

Design/Methodology/Approach This study’s model merges text mining and KE to extract key descriptive Kansei terminology according to actual customer reviews and use it to forecast consumer preferred product design while reducing certain repetitious tasks of designers. This work first collects online product reviews using text mining. Then, through the application of KE, the customer-preferred design components are identified and incorporated into the product design specifications. Finally, an Application Programming Interface (API) is developed to automatically generate a CAD preliminary design. Case Study A road bike case study is provided to demonstrate the practicality of proposed method. The online reviews are collected from Amazon.com. The related design elements are classified into six key components which can be modified in the proposed conceptual design automation system. Originality/value This is the first paper that has applied text mining and KE for use in product development. This work can also reduce the time and cost of product design through the automation of repetitive design tasks.

The resulting necessity to increase competitiveness has forced manufacturing industries to rethink their offer portfolio, also implementing servitization strategies. In particular, given the dramatic raise of customers’ awareness as regards environmental and energy problems, the energy industry is also considering the provision of Product-Service System (PSS) solutions (i.e. the bundle of energy services to energy efficiency related products) as a profitable alternative. However, the design of PSS and in particular of the service content of the offer is a challenging activity, mainly due to the fact that services are by definition characterized by high level of intangibility and perishability, and to the fact that standard tools and methodologies for service engineering are not available. The SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) [1] aims at supporting companies in these design and implementation phases. The methodology is in its development phase and its applicability in industry has been mainly tested in one specific context. This paper deals with the application of SEEM in the context of Energy Services (ESs) where the design phase can be much more complex than in other areas due to the variety of industries offering this kind of services and to the number of stakeholders involved during the service provision. In particular, this paper refers to a specific ES (the provision of data elaboration and analysis to energy consumption monitoring and control purposes) marketed together with energy meters. The general aim of this work is to provide a first analysis and a general understanding of the applicability of this existing methodology to the ES field by the mean of a real case study. In the paper, main steps of the application of the SEEM to the case study are described and discussed, to highlight main criticalities. In the end, a critical analysis is provided in order to put the basis to generalize the insights of this work to additional Energy Services.}

As a result, the International Maritime Organization has issued several new Regulations regarding ships’ systems that must be considered during the vessel design phases. In particular, one of the most important approaches introduced by this set of rules consists of the Safe Return to Port (SRtP) concept: basically, the ship itself represents its best lifeboat. Essential systems on-board passenger ships shall be designed in order to both guarantee their functionality and allow the return of the ship to the nearest port during specific emergency situations. Consequently, it is evident that designers should pay great attention to these systems since the early stages of the project. In this framework, proper IT design tools able to simulate systems functionality can represent a valuable aid to ensure compliance with the SRtP requirements. In this paper, the basic principles of SRtP Regulations are thoroughly presented. Furthermore, an IT tool, specifically implemented to address the suggested design approach for ship systems, is analyzed.}

We extracted service factors from face-to-face interviews with senior managers and experienced consultants of the hot springs hotel industry conducted in Phase 1. During Phase 2, we interviewed older adults at hot springs, and performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the reliability and validity of customer service factors. The results highlighted the following seven customer service factors: “health promotion treatments,” “mental learning,” “experience of unique tourism resources,” “complementary therapies,” “relaxation,” “healthy diet,” and “social activities.” According to these service factors, the older adults interviewed were divided into a holistic group, physiocare group, and leisure and recreation group using cluster analysis.

abstract = {Nowadays, with the development of information technology and economic globalization, supplier selection problem gets more and more attraction. The recent literature shows huge interest in hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for solving supplier selection problem. In this paper, to solve a multi-criteria supplier selection problem, based on genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), hybrid algorithm of GA and ACO is developed. It combines merits of GA with great global converging rate and ACO with parallelism and effective feedback. A numerical experiment was conducted to optimize parameters and to analyze and compare the performance of the original and hybrid algorithms. Results demonstrate the quality and efficiency improvement of new integrated algorithm, verifying its feasibility and effectiveness. It is an innovative pilot research to leverage hybrid AI-based algorithm of GA and ACO to settle the supplier selection problem, which not only makes a clear methodological contribution for optimization algorithm research, but also can be served as a decision tool and provide management reference for companies.}

Supplier selection process is one of the key activities of management in a supply chain environment. This paper presents another methodology to select the most suitable supplier in a supply chain system using Fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS). Triangular Fuzzy set is applied into the proposed model to handle the vagueness. The interdependencies between criteria are considered. In our FTOPSIS model, the results show that FTOPSIS is remarkably successful in determining the best supplier with stability in the ranking as it relates to the different criteria weights and multiple sub-criteria. The proposed methodology presents a comprehensive multi-criteria approach to find the best ranking among the alternative suppliers. The result shows that supplier A is the best supplier with the Closeness Coefficient of 0.5407. The FTOPSIS model proposed can be apply on other vague multiple criteria decision making problem since it shows good result in the research. Future research may expand the work to another field of study or in a different type of industry.}

Detailed application to quasi-crystals uses these diagrammatic regularities to facilitate the recognition of phenomenological trends and to identify chemical factors which favor quasi-crystal formation. This provides severe constraints on compositions at which quasi-crystals or crystalline approximants are likely to form. Several computerized search strategies which utilize the diagrammatic conditions to identify compositions for experimental investigation are outlined.}

For the given dimensions of the vehicle and the given terrain-wheel system constants, the relationship between the effective tractive and braking effort of the vehicle, the amount of sinkage of the front and rear wheels, the total amount of sinkage of the vehicle, and the slip ratio were calculated to estimate the optimum height of force of application and the optimum eccentricity of the center of gravity of the vehicle. It was observed that, during driving action, the maximum effective tractive effort of the four wheel drive vehicle (4WD) was larger than that of the rear wheel drive vehicle (RWD), which in turn was greater than that of the front wheel drive vehicle (FWD). During the braking action, the effective braking effort at skid -20% of the four wheel vehicle (4WB) was larger than that of the front wheel brake vehicle (FWB), in turn greater than that of the rear wheel brake vehicle (RWB), when the two-axle four wheel vehicle is moving up or down the loose sandy sloped terrain. The maximum terrain slope angle up which the two-axle wheeled vehicle is able to move during driving action was found to be about 0.067π rad for the 4WD vehicle, about 0.031π rad for the RWD vehicle, and about 0.017π rad for the FWD vehicle. The effective braking effort at skid-20% of 4WB, FWB and RWB was found to decrease with slope angle.}

The fierce market competition environment has promoted that PSS for public warehousing must improve service satisfaction to attract customers’ continuous cooperation. In order to make the service satisfaction results more reasonable and reliable, an evaluation method considering customer preferences is proposed. Firstly, the standard impact loss method is adopted to determine initial weights of evaluation indexes, and then Kano model is used to adjust the above weights on the premise of considering customer preferences. Afterwards, according to whether the evaluation index is profit-oriented or output-cost-oriented, the positive and negative distance based on the average solution is obtained. Finally, an example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is expected that the evaluation results can provide a decision-making basis for customers to choose a suitable PSS scheme.}

This work presents the effectiveness assessment of several government EV promotional policies in India based on the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) strategies by considering the general societal outlooks. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) scheme is adopted for prioritization followed by the qualitative evaluations of the adopted methodology. From the work, the charging infrastructure development support is identified as the most effective policy measure to improve the EV market diffusion in India. Moreover, some suggestive measures are also presented as the contribution towards the attainment of several sustainable development targets, such as the disincentivization of conventional vehicles, accelerating the pace of effective battery charging/swapping infrastructure facilities, and promoting the utilization of energy-mix technologies, etc.}

Both subjects are studied independently in the literature, showing a need for an integrated approach that bridges these areas. For achieving this purpose, a new scale was developed based on a questionnaire applied to two universities in Turkey. The scale aimed to measure the perceptions of the students regarding the quality of sustainable campus services. The questionnaire consisted of 22 questions on several aspects of campus services which are related to sustainability. A total of 234 samples were used for Exploratory Factor Analysis for determining the underlying structures in the data set. The scale was validated with satisfactory Kaiser-Meyer Olkin and Bartlett’s test results. Five dimensions were extracted, which represent sustainable service quality. After validation, the scale was applied to two universities located in geographically and socio-economically different regions of Turkey. The term chosen for the proposed combined scale is Sustainable Service Quality (SusServQual). With additional data, t-tests were applied to 308 students aiming to compare the two universities based on perceived quality scores. The results show that the university located in the socio-economically more developed region performed better regarding the overall satisfaction score and four of the five dimensions. The scores were also weighted utilizing a modified method of Analytical Hierarchy Process. Instead of crisp numbers which forces the decision maker to think in mathematical terms while comparing criteria, linguistic terms, each of which corresponds to a fuzzy number were used. Thus, a more accurate evaluation was obtained where the decision maker’s subjectivity and ambiguity of the situation are important.}

abstract = {This study focuses on the strategic decision-making process for selecting airport locations in developing countries, where investment constraint is a significant concern. Recognizing that airport location decisions are influenced by a multitude of factors, often in the absence of comprehensive data and amidst uncertain forecasts, there is a need for a methodology capable of adeptly handling various factors under uncertainty. The goal is to provide solutions that remain feasible and near-optimal, even with some variations in input parameters, ensuring robustness. To this end, this research introduces a decision tool incorporating Slack-Based Measurement in Robust Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-RDEA). The Slack-based method is beneficial in cases with multiple inputs and outputs where their relationships are not strictly proportional, as in the airport location selection problem. DEA, in conjunction with Multiple Regression analysis, leverages available data on the attributes of operational regional airports to compute the significance of these criteria in shaping the success factors of these facilities. Furthermore, these weightings can be employed to evaluate the suitability of airport locations currently under development and assess their potential for contributing to regional development. Additionally, to address the uncertainty of input data, a Robust optimization approach is employed to ensure a reliable response for this strategic decision-making process. This weighting framework is utilized twice within the research methodology: first, to assess the potential of different counties in the state for hosting a new regional airport, and second, to identify the optimal location for the airport in an MCDM-GIS analysis. This methodology has been applied to a case study in Sistan and Baluchistan, Iran. The result of the proposed method has been compared with one of the most common existing methodologies. This method identifies Zahedan County as having the highest potential and selects the location (29.48° N, 60.90° E), in the east of Zahedan city, as the optimal site for airport construction. Validation results confirm the efficacy of this solution.}

The exploration and evaluation of alternatives early in the product development (PD) process reduces the amount and magnitude of changes in later stages and increases the likelihood of success of new product development (NPD) projects. Though, currently available methods attempt to select the best concept from the available set of initial concepts, they do not help create an improved concept based on the learning and knowledge generated through the evaluation of initial concepts. The paper proposes a framework for selecting and/or evolving improved concepts through a rigorous concept evaluation and convergence process. The concept convergence process allows bringing together the best (desirable) traits from the initial set of concepts and creates a new set of hybrid concepts. The framework uses a fuzzy inference process for evaluating each initial concept against identified decision criteria, thus generating hybrid concepts to select the best feasible concept under given cost and technological constraints. The approach is demonstrated using a steering wheel concept generation example.}

More importantly, based on the thought of Inverse Design (ID), a new design method of MSF is presented comprehensively analyzing aircraft’s CSS in a combat mission without using any empirical MSF. The definition of MSS based ID is given and the design procedure is sequentially introduced. Two different confrontation cases are depicted with many details as the simulation validation: Air-to-ground and Penetration.

A fuzzy-decision-tree algorithm is applied to provide a more objective approach given the evidence of previous manufacturing technology implementation cases. The model uses the information relationship of key technology decision variables, project requirements of an implemented technology case and the success outcome of a project to support decision problems. An empirical study was conducted at an aircraft manufacturer to support their technology decision for a typical medium complexity assembly investment project. The experimental analysis demonstrated encouraging results and practical viability of the approach.}

Because role models are crucial to training physicians to care for the underserved, we examined pedi-atric faculty’s knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, skills, and precepting behaviors regarding care for this population.
Methods
Faculty knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills/precepting behaviors were surveyed.
Results
Fifty-five (65%) of 85 faculty responded. The mean (standard deviation) knowledge score was 5.9 (1.3) of 8 possible. More than one-third of faculty did not recognize the eligibility criteria, services, and outcomes associated with common resources serving the underserved. Overall attitudes toward underserved families were positive, mean 3.3 (0.3), as was mean self-efficacy, 3.0 (0.7). Self-efficacy was lowest for accessing community resources for underserved families, 2.4 (0.7). Although most faculty performed the surveyed skills, fewer than 50% reported precepting of these same skills with students. Precepting was lowest for accessing public and community resources.
Conclusions
Low rates of student precepting as well as specific knowledge and self-efficacy deficits highlight potential targets for faculty development.}

abstract = {At the outset of designing a new product, knowledge about the product is limited, but the designer has a considerable amount of design freedom. Considering the environmental implications of a product design early in the design phase is a crucial step in achieving an environmentally efficient product. By applying the axiomatic approach to a product's design, the designer can ensure that the final embodiment of the product or service satisfies the obligatory and necessary set of functional requirements and constraints, including environmental issues. In this paper we show how the integration of environmental considerations early in the process of axiomatic design can lead to the development of an environmental-friendly product or service. The paper demonstrates an artificial case study of designing a modern manufacturing system. A major issue investigated in this work is the possibility of assessing environmental performance (or environmental-related information) already in the preliminary stages of the design process. An upper bound for the probability of a product failing to satisfy environmental requirements is introduced. In addition, the suitability of lifecycle analysis to the assessment of products during the process of axiomatic design is discussed.}

abstract = {Despite all efforts, many product development projects fail and lead to the introduction of products that do not meet customers' expectations. A high level of customer satisfaction cannot be obtained. On the other hand, in many product development projects the process of product development is conducted very unsystematically and resources are wasted because of a lack of communication between the different functions involved in product development. Time especially is a critical factor within product development as time to market is becoming increasingly more important. Managers need a set of practical step-by-step tools and methods which ensure a better understanding of customers' needs and requirements, as well as procedures and processes to enhance communication by focusing on the voice of the customer within a product development project. The authors propose a methodology, based on Kano's model of customer satisfaction, to explore customers' stated needs and unstated desires and to resolve them into different categories which have different impacts on customer satisfaction. It is shown how this categorization can be used as a basis for product development, especially for quality function deployment. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the strategic importance of customer satisfaction, then Kano's model and its combination with quality function deployment is demonstrated, using a case study from the ski industry. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the managerial implications and the consequences of the application of these tools.}

SC sustainability, which pays attention to the environmental, economic, and social aspects in SC, has been recently highlighted in the evaluation process undergone by the SC managers. Suppliers, as the basic components of the SC, play a significant role in creating a sustainable SC. Hence, the first aim of this research is to determine the weights of sustainability criteria by using analytical hierarchy process. The second aim of this study is to evaluate suppliers based on four main criteria, CO2 emissions, the number of employees in the suppliers’ country industry, water consumption and distance from supplier's country to the destination at three SC levels and the macroeconomic (international) level. In order to address the second goal of this research, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a multi-criteria decision-making method has been applied. In this research, Iran's steel industry has been selected as the case study. Results show that the Iranian mining industry is the best sustainable supplier for Iran's steel industry. In addition, Iran was found as the best sustainable supplier country for most suppliers in Iran's steel industry SC based on the three SC sustainability criteria at three levels. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been applied according to the different weights of the sustainability criteria. The results of this research can help managers in the steel industry to deal with the supplier selection problem at the macro-level. Furthermore, the presented approach in this research can assist managers of other industries to select and evaluate their suppliers.}

abstract = {The increasing level of competition and technological development in industrial and service companies has motivated new developments in workstation design. When designing workstations, analysts are frequently asked to list components to be included in the project and choose for each component the best alternative from a set of candidates. Leaving aside the esthetical value, the best choice is the one satisfying ergonomic (e.g., anthropometric and biomechanical characteristics) and commercial (e.g., warranty length and service level provided by manufacturers) criteria. The ranking of alternatives according to such criteria usually requires a scoring procedure that simultaneously handles their quantitative and qualitative nature. In this paper we propose a method for ranking workstation component alternatives regarding predefined criteria. The method we propose combines quantitative (objectively measured) and qualitative (expert opinion based) evaluations performed on alternatives in search of a best choice. Our method also enables analysts to prioritize workstation components based on their impact on users’ demands, optimizing resource allocation. To illustrate the method steps, we present a case study where the objective is to determine the best work seat for a tollbooth.
Relevance to industry
This paper provides a structured procedure to address a major problem in industrial workstation design: how to provide workers an ergonomically consistent workstation yet customized to their personal needs. The method proposed does not require any statistical or mathematical training from practitioners and its calculations may be carried out using a spreadsheet software. Finally, all method steps are illustrated in a case example, which should improve its chances of actual application.}

abstract = {Sini Decoction (SND) has been proven to be an effective formula to alleviate cardiac injury of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the potential mechanism of SND remains unclear. In this study, the MI rat model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. A total of 17 SND-distributed components in heart were identified by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOFMS). The combination of four-dimensional (4D) proteomics and network pharmacology was employed to find the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, and molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were used to reveal the interactions between the potential targets and the potential active components distributed in heart of SND. 33 SND-effected proteins were identified by 4D proteomics, which was involved in carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and PPAR signaling pathway. 17 potential SND-targeted direct proteins were screened by comparing SND-effected proteins generated from 4D proteomics with the MI-related proteins obtained from disease database. The potential relationships between 17 components and 17 potential SND-targeted direct proteins were established by molecular docking analysis, in which songorine, benzoylhypaconine, hypaconine, formononetin, and liquiritigenin could be bound to the surrounding amino acid residues in the binding pocket of Mtor, Parp1, Acadm, Crat, and Aldh2. Then, CETSA analysis further confirmed that songorine and benzoylhypaconine could increase the heat stability of Mtor and Parp1 in cardiac tissue lysate, respectively, which suggested that there existed direct interactions between songorine and Mtor, and benzoylhypaconine and Parp1. In summary, this work concluded that SND produced cardioprotective effects mainly through preserving energy metabolism, also demonstrated that the combination of 4D proteomics and network pharmacology was a promising tool for uncovering the molecular mechanisms of multi-components multi-targets effects of TCM.}

APF techniques have been widely known for their outstanding performance against the path quality and computational time trade-of problem for path planning techniques. However, Since APF techniques are optimization problems, they suffer from well-known problems such as the minima trap problem and the narrow passage problem. The APF planner can fail to find an obstacle-firee path to the final goal point and simply be trapped in a local minima for some map configurations. This paper proposes a new path planning technique that aims to take the advantage of the APF technique as well as solving the APF problems of local trap and narrow passage problems. The proposed technique is inspired by the fluid dynamic concepts and adopts an artificial “flushing” operation. The robot and the obstacles will be placed in an artificial pool. The robot will have negligible weight while the obstacles will be fixed in the pool. Once the “flushing” operation starts, the robot will be automatically pulled by the water to the flushing point which is the goal point. It is guaranteed that the water in the whole map will be absorbed into the flushing point and no particles will be trapped in any region. The simulation results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed technique and demonstrated its ability to overcome the challenge of local minima traps in potential field path planning.}

In light of this, this paper proposes a suitable web-based process planning system that can be used to effectively bend varieties of sheet metal products using various bending press machines. Three web-based process planning system concepts were formulated in this study and evaluated using various criteria. The result of the Weighted Decision Matrix (WDM) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analyses revealed that web-based process planning system concept Y with a cumulative assessment score of 1.90 and a priority assessment score of 0.637 is the suitable web-based process planning system that could be used to effectively bend varieties of sheet metals. This evaluation approach serves as a useful information for system designers in other manufacturing sectors, to select suitable systems capable of effectively carrying out their operations.}

abstract = {This paper argues that MENA resource-rich economies must go beyond simply replicating the “standard model” of electricity market liberalisation. They need to not only adapt the standard model to their unique contexts but also integrate it with other elements of their energy systems through harnessing complementarities between existing policies. The integrated model therefore includes additional modules: rationalising end user prices, improving energy efficiency, integrating renewables, and collapsing the “silos” between different energy vectors. The success of the extended reform model, however, is crucially contingent upon taking into account three particular factors in its implementation. First, reforming energy prices requires a better understanding of the underpinning logic of subsidies beyond popular justifications around the “social contract” or “political compact”. Second, energy efficiency is a challenging initiative in the MENA region, which the correction of price signals can only partially resolve, due to other factors that influence it, such as path dependency, market failures and consumer behaviour. And third, incentivising investments in renewable energy requires careful design of the balance of roles between the market and government, as renewable support schemes may lead to an increased role for centralised coordination, thereby contradicting the originally intended objectives of electricity market reform.}

Key drivers underpinning market success have the capacity to develop the “right” products for the “right” customers, using the “right” channels, with a shorter development cycle than competitors. But when breakthrough products (BTPs) are involved, how do we sort out what is “right”? How do we identify customers' future requirements when the technology platforms are still unfolding, products are still in development and customers lack experience with the product? Traditional product development market research techniques are problematic since they assume the customer has historical experience with products similar to those being created. The objective of this paper is to raise the awareness of the OM community with the strengths and weaknesses of existing methodologies for developing and introducing innovative products to market. Further, it suggests promising future directions for both practice and research when BTPs are involved.

In this paper, a DSM consisting of 172 design parameters and 682 dependencies is constructed to represent the typical process employed at the Mission Design Laboratory (MDL), an ICE facility at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Analysis of the DSM reveals an optimal sequencing among five phases of the ICE design process, the interdependent disciplines in the design team, and a set of starting assumptions that can be made at the outset of the work to facilitate a more structured approach to the highly complex and iterative process of space systems design.}

abstract = {In design, most of recent researches focused on criteria related only to the product. These criteria do not take into account the context of the organization which is related to the enterprise's system. In sustainable design, the choice of the best product design scenario is more complex. In fact, the number of issues is importantly high, the data is imprecise and the criteria are interdependent. This situation is more critical in an advanced stage of the design process where the decisions and choices will monitor the next steps of this process. The purpose of this paper is to improve the design approaches in a critical stage from an environmental, economic and social perspective. It deals with two main challenges, the first one is the identification of product design scenarios that are coherent with the organization's context, in terms of internal and external issues along with requirements of the stakeholders. The second challenge is the selection of the optimal option from a high number of identified scenarios. To this end, a new model with two main steps is proposed to deal with both challenges. The methodology is based on two steps. The first depends on a trilogy (i.e. Strategic, tactical, and operational). It generates operational scenarios on the basis of value chain-driven sustainable design strategies using SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunity, Threats), PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal), 7S (Structure, Strategy, Shared Values, Style, Staff, Systems, Skills) to identify a multitude of scenarios. The second step is the choice of the optimal scenario that satisfies interdependent criteria using simplified life cycle assessment tools to compute sustainability impacts' indicators, the Choquet integral to minimize the number of scenarios, and the fuzzy analytic network process to select the optimal operational scenario. The proposed model is then implemented in a Tunisian company that manufactures lead acid batteries for motorcycles. The results proved the influence of the organization's context on the choice of the optimal sustainable design scenario. The organization was able to develop strategies and tactics on the basis of its strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities. The number of design alternatives was reduced using relevance checks based on influence and control criteria. Environmental, economic and social indicators were computed per life cycle phase in order to be used as inputs in the Choquet integral and the analytic network process algorithms. The proposed model guided the organization to adopt a coherent design scenario that respects the sustainable development criteria.}

Facing the new challenges in production processes, companies should adopt lean and green practices in product development. In SMEs, the application of these practices is more complex. This work explores the maturity of lean–green methodologies in the product development process in Brazilian and Japanese SMEs. The methodology used is multicriteria, combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and TOPSIS 2-tuple method, applied to four Japanese SMEs and four Brazilian SMEs in the metalworking sector. The criteria for evaluating SMEs are company flexibility, difficulties with NPD, innovation, limited resources, and personnel authority high. The TOPSIS method alternatives refer to 18 lean–green enablers. In the AHP method, the prioritisation of criteria between Japanese and Brazilian specialists presented divergences. In the Japanese context, the incidence of innovation is predominant, while in the Brazilian context, the most important is the limited resources. In the TOPSIS 2-tuple method, the results showed a higher level of maturity in lean–green methodologies in Japanese companies than in Brazilian ones. Lean practices are more evolved compared to sustainable practices in both countries. The study also addressed how open innovation adoption may contribute to innovation and NPD practices. Policymakers need to understand the heterogeneity of innovators within SMEs and how they differently innovate, developing distinct internal and external activities.}

abstract = {Introduction
The purpose of this work was to develop and implement six sigma practices toward the enhancement of patient safety in an electronic, quality checklist-driven, multicenter, paperless radiation medicine department.
Methods and Materials
A quality checklist process map (QPM), stratified into consultation through treatment-completion stages was incorporated into an oncology information systems platform. A cross-functional quality management team conducted quality-function-deployment and define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) six sigma exercises with a focus on patient safety. QPM procedures were Pareto-sorted in order of decreasing patient safety risk with failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). Quantitative metrics for a grouped set of highest risk procedures were established. These included procedural delays, associated standard deviations and six sigma Z scores. Baseline performance of the QPM was established over the previous year of usage. Data-driven analysis led to simplification, standardization, and refinement of the QPM with standard deviation, slip-day reduction, and Z-score enhancement goals. A no-fly policy (NFP) for patient safety was introduced at the improve-control DMAIC phase, with a process map interlock imposed on treatment initiation in the event of FMEA-identified high-risk tasks being delayed or not completed. The NFP was introduced in a pilot phase with specific stopping rules and the same metrics used for performance assessments. A custom root-cause analysis database was deployed to monitor patient safety events.
Results
Relative to the baseline period, average slip days and standard deviations for the risk-enhanced QPM procedures improved by over threefold factors in the NFP period. The Z scores improved by approximately 20%. A trend for proactive delays instead of reactive hard stops was observed with no adverse effects of the NFP. The number of computed potential no-fly delays per month dropped from 60 to 20 over a total of 520 cases. The fraction of computed potential no-fly cases that were delayed in NFP compliance rose from 28% to 45%. Proactive delays rose to 80% of all delayed cases. For potential no-fly cases, event reporting rose from 18% to 50%, while for actually delayed cases, event reporting rose from 65% to 100%.
Conclusions
With complex technologies, resource-compromised staff, and pressures to hasten treatment initiation, the use of the six sigma driven process interlocks may mitigate potential patient safety risks as demonstrated in this study.}

The integration of sustainable Manufacturing in industrial operations leads to enhanced process performances through the reduction of wastes, cost, and environmental impacts and satisfies ergonomic conditions. For this reason, various firms have adopted sustainable manufacturing concepts to enhance their performances and hold a prestigious competitive position. The purpose of this research is to develop an integrated Pythagorean Fuzzy MCDM model to enhance the application process of the conventional Lean Manufacturing approach (LM). Firstly, an extended Value Steam Mapping is proposed to assess the sustainability of the manufacturing process and identify the causes of waste from a sustainability viewpoint. Secondly, Pythagorean Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (PF-DEMATEL) is employed to analyze the interrelationship among the identified. Thirdly, Pythagorean Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (PF-TOPSIS) is introduced to prioritize a set of solutions in order to overcome the investigated causes and improve the durability of the manufacturing operations. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conduced to assess the effectiveness of the obtained results. The proposed method has several attractive features. It can address the drawbacks of the conventional LM and enhance its analysis and improvement tasks. However, the proposed approach offers an advanced application process for Lean Manufacturing in a sustainability context. Additionally, the suggested strategy facilitates the leaders to assess the current state of the manufacturing processes and select the appropriate solutions for successful sustainability implementation. The validity of the proposed approach was investigated in a real case study. The results confirm its effectiveness and indicate that using MCDM approaches in LM application process offers a consistent and flexible demarche for sustainable manufacturing implementation.}

Hybridizations with other reinforcements or matrices can improve mechanical properties of natural fibre composite. Moreover, geometric optimizations have a significant role in structural strength improvement. This study focused on selecting the best geometrical bumper beam concept to fulfill the safety parameters of the defined product design specification (PDS). The mechanical properties of developed hybrid composite material were considered in different bumper beam concepts with the same frontal curvature, thickness, and overall dimensions. The low-speed impact test was simulated under the same conditions in Abaqus V16R9 software. Six weighted criteria, which were deflection, strain energy, mass, cost, easy manufacturing, and the rib possibility were analyzed to form an evaluation matrix. Topsis method was employed to select the best concept. It is concluded that double hat profile (DHP) with defined material model can be used for bumper beam of a small car. In addition, selected concept can be strengthened by adding reinforced ribs or increasing the thickness of the bumper beam to comply with the defined PDS.}

In this article, an overview of the application of TRM in renewable energy sector has been provided. After survey of the relevant academic literature and industry roadmaps, we tried to group the roadmaps related to the renewable energy technologies into national, industry/sector and organizational level roadmaps. Research findings indicate that goals and objectives of renewable energy roadmaps are different at these three levels. At national level, roadmaps focus on future energy security, energy dependence, energy policy formulation and environment protection. At industry/sector level, roadmaps are used to identify vision, common needs and evaluate barriers, constraints and risks faced by the industry from technical, political and commercial aspects. Organizational roadmap focuses on evaluation and prioritization of R&D projects to achieve the business goals. Similarly different methods, tools and approaches are used to develop roadmaps at different levels. Various other characteristics of these roadmaps are also discussed and analyzed. Research findings also indicate that greater numbers of roadmaps are developed for those renewable energy technologies undergoing rapid growth. Moreover, most of these roadmaps are developed in the regions where more research, development and deployment activities of renewable energy technologies is taking place.}

The service of a NICU department is very complex due to the fact that in addition to treating the premature infant there is a very high involvement of the family members. Naturally, the infant is unable to communicate and his/her parents are acting as the voice of the customer. Thus, the staff must take care on the family members’ needs during the hospitalization of their child. This fact created the Service Concept of the department: our customer is the premature infant together with his parents. Thus, the concept's components include processes supporting this complex clinical environment as: Admission process controlled and measured by Yield measures (Medical Yield and Nursing Yield), family escorting process to support the family with updated data on a regular planned basis regarding the child clinical condition and training sessions prior to the child discharge. Special attention and control is given to the supply of food and liquids (pending on the child's clinical condition). Prior to discharge the parents get a special training session in order to smooth as much as possible the process of returning home and start their life in the community including the medical support of the authorities outside the hospital. A computerized system was developed to support the management and control of all processes including a digital patient record. The various processes’ Yields are presented to the staff (physicians and nurses) every month and a discussion is conducted to verify needed improvement and correction activities. Satisfaction surveys are conducted prior to discharge in order to get inputs regarding all the subjects related to the family's service perception while their child was hospitalized. Results show improvement of the various yield measures.}

Comparison target costing calculation and traditional calculation show target gap. Target costing calculation is new modern instrument that it facilitates to manage price of product by the customers’ requirements. The price is determined by market and customer's needs. In this phase is possible to fix costs of product. In praxis we often meet with situation where the price of product is very high and customer is not ready to pay so much. Target costing calculation limits cost of production.}

However, relatively little scientific knowledge is available on the application and usefulness of product roadmapping in software product development context. This study develops a framework for software product roadmapping, which is then used to study the critical aspects of the product roadmapping process. The collection of empirical evidence includes both quantitative and qualitative data which sheds further insight into the complexities involved in product roadmapping. Results revealed that organizations view the product roadmap mainly as a tool for strategic decision making as it aims at showing the future directions of the company's products. However, only a few companies appear to have an explicit approach for handling the mechanisms for creating and maintaining such a roadmap. Finally, it is suggested that the strategic importance of product roadmapping is likely to increase in the future and, as a conclusion, a new type of agility is required in order to survive in the turbulent and competitive software business environment.}

abstract = {Milling is one of the most used machining processes thanks to its high flexibility and high achievable quality. The performance of milling machines is constantly increasing, improving the convenience and increasing the competitiveness of this operation. However, the trend of performance improvement has found a technological limit: self-excited vibrations due to the dynamics of the system machine-workpiece-tooling (i.e. chatter). Chatter is the most dangerous dynamic phenomena that could happen during milling; due to its regenerative nature, it could lead the machine and the tooling system to a heavy fault or to the disruption of the workpiece. This paper develops an active workpiece holder that avoids chatter vibrations by a smart actuation of the workpiece. The design of the workpiece holder is a difficult task due to strict product requirements and the need to create a decoupled structure. The decoupling of the structure is a fundamental requirement of the product because this affects the controllability of the system. Axiomatic Design Theory is used to support the definition of the product requirements and the product architecture. After the definition of the optimal structure of the workpiece, the design features are integrated in order to obtain a functional decoupled structure.}

for energy efficiency (DfEE) is highly valued in improving the energy efficiency during product use and the decisions with a significant impact on the product’s energy-efficiency performance are made during early design stages. The product’s design features determined in early design stages are hierarchical in nature and the design process for new products is generally top-down. However, current DfEE methods tend to firstly improve the design features on the bottom level and then the higher level till the energy-efficiency target is achieved. The contradiction between the top-down design process and the bottom-up energy-efficiency improvement severely limits the innovation in new product design and hinders the emergence of highly energy-efficient products. In addition, the energy-efficiency improvement is divergent and can generate a large number of solutions, but the design process needs to be convergent and arrives at a few or a single best solution. This paper proposes a top-down DfEE method called three-step cyclic design method for new product development in early design stages. It is based on a spiral design process and a three-layer framework of DfEE activities. The former supports a top-down approach for energy-efficiency improvement, and the latter ensures a convergent DfEE process. The implementation of this method is detailed through a case study of a wind turbine.}

The study is designed in four phases. In the first phase, suppliers are ranked by using integrated the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (F-PROMETHEE) considering social and environmental factors as well as economic factors. The output of the first phase is used in the second phase of the method. In the second phase, a fuzzy multi-objective optimization (FMOO) model is proposed to find quantities to be purchased from suppliers. In the third phase, both the Augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method and LP-metrics are used to obtain the Pareto front of the problem. Finally, in the fourth phase, a solution is selected by the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) from the non-dominated solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown on real data from a firm selling medical devices.}

abstract = {The construction procurement process has been heavily criticised for its fragmented approach toward the delivery of construction projects. This has affected project effectiveness inasmuch as current procurement practices do not effectively encourage the integration, coordination and communication between participants. In addition, there is an ephemeral shifting coalition of participants from which divergent goals and objectives often emanate. This inhibits the scope for creativity and innovation throughout the procurement process. To overcome the difficulties often associated with procuring projects, industry practitioners and researchers have turned to the manufacturing industry as a point of reference and a potential source of innovation. Accordingly, a concept known as Concurrent Engineering (CE) has become a focal point for research. Concurrent engineering is a holistic approach to the design, development and production of a product. A multi-disciplinary team approach is required, whereby participants are brought together during the design to determine how downstream issues may be affected by design decisions. This paper suggests that a CE approach in construction may significantly improve the way in which projects are procured. A simple model demonstrating how CE can contribute to project effectiveness is proposed.}

This article aims to provide a structured overview of sustainability performance evaluation related publications and to document the current state of literature, categorize publications, analyze and link trends, as well as highlight gaps and provide research recommendations. 128 articles between 2007 and 2018 are identified. The results suggest that sustainability performance evaluation models shall be more balanced, suitable criteria and their interrelations shall be well defined and subjectivity of qualitative criteria inherent to sustainability indicators shall be considered. To address this subjectivity, group decision-making techniques and other analytical methods that can deal with uncertainty, conflicting indicators, and linguistic evaluations can be used in future works. By presenting research gaps, this review stimulates researchers to establish practically applicable sustainability performance evaluation frameworks to help assess and compare the degree of sustainability, leading to more sustainable business practices. The review is unique in defining corporate sustainability performance evaluation for the first time, exploring the gap between sustainability accounting and sustainability assessment, and coming up with a structured overview of innovative research recommendations about integrating analytical assessment methods into conceptual sustainability frameworks.}

A survey based study has been conducted with an aim to identify main predictors of agile manufacturing enablers and to develop a model for agile manufacturing enablers. The framed hypotheses for the four sections of agility enablers were tested by ANOVA. Four sections of enabler were organization’s people, organization’s virtual integration & collaboration, organization’s information technology & communication, and organization’s tools & technology. Principal component analysis was applied to identify main components of agile enablers. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to generate model for agile manufacturing enablers. Analytical hierarchy process has been used to rank the variables of components pictured in linear regression model. Afterward, a complete regression model has been prepared with the help of priority vectors generated by AHP. The variables information system interface with customers, employee’s empowerment, sharing of concepts and CAD/CAM found as the most important agile enablers. Therefore, these agile enables need high attention to make an organization agile. The status of agile enablers in Indian manufacturing industries has been calculated and it is found that the level of agile enablers in Indian manufacturing industries is quite low.}

Specifically we observe how levels of engagement – based on active involvement in project tradespace exploration – influences the quality of project plans and readiness of teams for performance. We hypothesize that shared awareness of project dynamics among project stakeholders increases through simulation-based training during the planning process. To test the hypothesis and the conditions of such increase, we conducted a comparative study comprising controlled experiments at Technion and MIT, using two Project Management planning approaches: (1) The traditional Gantt chart development supported by critical path analysis and (2) role-based project simulation. This study of a small test population shows a difference in the increase of shared understanding among project stakeholders based on the planning method followed. These initial results suggest that a team's method for tradespace exploration matters, influencing shared awareness early on in the project life cycle. In future experiments we hope to further test this finding and continue to investigate correlation with readiness for improved decision making throughout the project life cycle.}
