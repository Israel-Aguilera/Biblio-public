abstract = {Many studies of ballpoint pens have been conducted. However, those studies have not considered the emotional factors that can enhance user experience. Styluses resemble ballpoint pens in many ways, which are widely available in a variety of styles. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the physical and emotional attributes that improve user satisfaction with typical ballpoint pens, with the goal of also understanding what factors might be important for stylus design. First, 14 emotional factors associated with the pens were derived. Second, 16 different types of ball-point pens were measured for six physical properties. Then, an experiment was performed to assess user satisfaction and emotional factors for pens. The House of Quality (HOQ) was used to obtain the chief physical properties. Results showed that to increase user satisfaction it is necessary to make pens be comfortable, fine, refined, deep, and natural. Also, we found that for high user satisfaction pens need to be heavier and longer, have thick and antislip grips and thin nibs, and their center of gravity should be located close to the nib to increase user satisfaction.}

abstract = {Supplier selection and order allocation have significant roles in supply chain management. These processes become major challenges when the demand is uncertain. This research presents a new two-stage solution approach for supplier selection and order allocation planning where a forecasting procedure is integrated with an optimization model. In the first stage, the demand is forecasted to handle the demand vagueness. A novel Relational Regressor Chain method is introduced to determine the future demand, which is compared with the Holt's Linear Trend and the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average methods to ensure the forecasting accuracy. The forecasted demand is then fed to the second stage where a multi-objective programming model is developed to identify suitable suppliers and order quantities from each supplier. Weighted-sum and ε-constraint methods are utilized to obtain the efficient solutions. To our knowledge, this paper is the first study that has integrated demand forecasting with the supplier selection and order allocation planning. A real dataset from a Canadian food supply network is used to examine the results of the forecasting methods and to determine the orders allocated to each supplier. The results of the forecasting methods show that the proposed Relational Regressor Chain method can forecast demand with a higher precision than the other forecasting methods considered in this paper. It is also evident from the results that the selection of the forecasting methods may have impact on both the selection of suppliers and the orders allocated to them.}

Moreover, these studies fail to address how customers meet their needs in-store (ISFR) and online fashion retailing (OFR). To fill this research gap, we empirically investigate customers' personal and social needs and how they can be met through the jobs-to-be-done theory. Findings reveal that, beyond the purchase of a garment, customer needs can be fulfilled through different ways, such as smart technology or a person's high interaction with social others in ISFR and the online shop experience or a social linkage without social interaction in OFR. Additionally, our findings offer potential service innovations for fashion retailing managers.}

We propose a novel multi-objective co-evolutionary approach for supply chain gap analysis by hybridizing two well-known algorithms of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) and multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed algorithm considers the best solution of NSGAII at each iteration and uses it as the initial population in MOPSO. We consider three objective functions, including the expected costs, the total time, and customer satisfaction. The house of quality and quality function deployment is used to transform customer requirements into product characteristics. We also use a response surface methodology with multi-objective decision making for tuning the parameters since metaheuristic methods are generally sensitive to input parameters. We finally generate several random problems with different scenarios to compare the performance of our hybrid approach with singular methods. Five performance measures (i.e., mean ideal distance, diversification metric, quality metric, data envelopment analysis, and hypervolume metric) are used for this comparison. The results show the hybrid approach proposed in this study outperforms singular NSGAII and MOPSO metaheuristics in most scenarios.}

abstract = {Importance
The role of airports is critical for a region in which it is viewed as an engine for the economic development. Facilities, infrastructure, information and in general the services offered by an airport represent the fuel for this engine. Evidently, customers and travelers expect standard-quality services that need to be framed and measured. Therefore, services in airports should be quantified and maintained, accordingly.
Objectives
This article reports a case study for evaluating quality of services offered by five main airports located in Spain. Quality of service was modelled based on a number of factors such as convenience, comfort, courtesy of staffs, information visibility, prices, security, and transportation facilities. The grey based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was employed towards a reliable evaluation process by airport experts and to accommodate the several qualitative and conflicting evaluation factors with distinct definitions. To this end, Grey Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA-G) and grey Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS-G) methods were applied for quantifying relative weights of decision factors and rating airports, respectively. Several sensitivity analysis, simulations, and comparisons were conducted for verifying the preciseness of the revealed results.
Findings
Research findings demonstrate that the proposed SWARA-G-MARCOS-G-based methodology (i) enables decision makers to express their preferences clearly; and (ii) attenuates the embedded subjectivity and uncertainty within the decision-making process. In addition, they revealed that access to the parking and Wi-Fi connection are amongst the critical factors in evaluating service quality of airport.
Contribution
This paper contributes to related literature in presenting a novel decision-making approach for measuring service quality of airports, validated via a real-case study. The employed interval and linguistic grey variables allow experts, in airport operations, to express their opinions with higher flexibility and comfortability. The presented model could be re-applied for other studies or practical cases as a user-friendly decision support system.}

abstract = {The main aim of this research is to demonstrate strategic supplier performance evaluation of a UK-based manufacturing organisation using an integrated analytical framework. Developing long term relationship with strategic suppliers is common in today׳s industry. However, monitoring suppliers׳ performance all through the contractual period is important in order to ensure overall supply chain performance. Therefore, client organisations need to measure suppliers׳ performance dynamically and inform them on improvement measures. Although there are many studies introducing innovative supplier performance evaluation frameworks and empirical researches on identifying criteria for supplier evaluation, little has been reported on detailed application of strategic supplier performance evaluation and its implication on overall performance of organisation. Additionally, majority of the prior studies emphasise on lagging factors (quality, delivery schedule and value/cost) for supplier selection and evaluation. This research proposes both leading (organisational practices, risk management, environmental and social practices) and lagging factors for supplier evaluation and demonstrates a systematic method for identifying those factors with the involvement of relevant stakeholders and process mapping. The contribution of this article is a real-life case-based action research utilising an integrated analytical model that combines quality function deployment and the analytic hierarchy process method for suppliers׳ performance evaluation. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated through number of validations (e.g. focus group, business results, and statistical analysis). Additionally, the study reveals that enhanced supplier performance results positive impact on operational and business performance of client organisation.}

abstract = {The cardiac muscle proteins, generating and regulating energy transduction during a heartbeat, assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively translating actin relative to myosin filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing ATP free energy into actin movement against resisting force. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity probably by transient N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these proteins involving them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause single residue substitutions with independent characteristics (sequence location, residue substitution, human demographic, and allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in a feed-forward neural network model. Trial models train and validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in myosin, mybpc3, or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given independent SNP characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP pathogenicity vs (in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident subpopulation bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages multiple sarcomere proteins functionally. Consistent with this observation, mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with myosin essential light chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent mechanism adapting myosin force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation.}

The aim of this paper is to propose an approach for both external and internal service management issue and service innovations based on the framework of Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD), a methodology that has been successfully adopted in new service development. Specifically, the paper addresses the issue of how to deploy the House of Quality (HoQ) to improve accommodation service innovation processes and tourist satisfaction effectively and efficiently. Fuzzy logic is a methodology to deal with the ill-defined nature of the tourist linguistic judgments required in the proposed HoQ. The tourism case in island accommodation demonstrates the implementation of the proposed FQFD. The effective and appropriate accommodation directions for service innovation designs acquired by applying the proposed FQFD, thus, enable hotels managers to achieve a competitive advantage.}

Unfortunately, the traditional design methods based on carbon footprint calculation are not suitable for the conceptual design stage, and the latest low-carbon conceptual design research mainly focus on technology development to reduce carbon emissions at the manufacturing stage and less on carbon emissions caused by the unsustainable human use. This makes low-carbon product conceptual design less effective. To address this, a low-carbon conceptual design method is proposed for improving existing products, in which an improved process of requirements elicitation and analysis is implemented firstly, and then the improvement strategies are proposed from the perspectives of technical system and human use to help establish a low-carbon function structure. The conceptual design of a boiling water dispenser is taken as a case study. As a result, 5 low-carbon design strategies and a low-carbon function structure were comprehensively obtained. Next, by calculating the energy consumption of the assumed ideal scenario, it can be found that the re-designed product can save 39.4% energy compared to the existing product in the use stage. The results showed that the proposed method is effective in the generation of low-carbon design schemes at the conceptual design stage.}

However, due to the large and fuzzy demand data, it is difficult to accurately extract DfRem targets from the customer demand data. Moreover, the process of DfRem scheme generation includes conceptual design, general design and detailed design. The remanufacturability of products needs be considered at the design process, which makes the DfRem scheme solution process very complicated. For the purpose of accurately extracting DfRem targets and shortening design cycle, it is necessary to apply intelligent technology for customer demand analysis and DfRem solution. To address this, an intelligent DfRem method based on vector space model (VSM) and case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. Firstly, for accurate extraction of DfRem targets, VSM is employed to extract customer demand data features from the mass customer demand data embedded with remanufacturing information, and K-means technique is applied to classify customer demand data features thus to extract DfRem targets. After extraction of DfRem targets, CBR is utilized to retrieve the case that is most similar to the DfRem targets from DfRem and remanufacturing process knowledge bases. In order to improve the accuracy of the retrieval, ontology is used to construct standard knowledge expression. Finally, this method has been evaluated utilizing the DfRem of clutch remanufacturing as case studies. The results show that the method can accurately generate design scheme to satisfy the customer demands. In this paper, the intelligent DfRem method has been developed by Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server, which can quickly generate the most suitable solution.}

This is gradually leading to a business shift from delivering traditional transaction-based, product-centric offering to the provision of integrated product-service systems (PSS). However, the number of companies failing in successfully pursue such a transition is still increasing. Consequently, Service Engineering (SE), a discipline concerned with the systematic development and design of services and product-services, is gaining particular interest in both the scientific and practitioner communities. This paper contributes to these fields by proposing a complete overview of the applicability of the SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) in an industrial context. The SEEM aims at supporting companies approaching the introduction of PSSs in their portfolio and suggests a structured decision-making process to (i) define the PSS offering most aligned with company product(s) and customer needs, (ii) (re-)engineer the (existing) service delivery processes, and (iii) balance the external performance (e.g. customer satisfaction, delivery time, service cycle time) with the internal performance (i.e. efficiency) of the service delivery process. The noteworthy benefits achievable through the SEEM are illustrated through a real case at the industrial partner ABB – a multinational company providing power and automation solutions. The implementation of all the SEEM steps is thoroughly described, and the advantages experienced along with the difficulties encountered are highlighted. Managerial implications and the main gaps to address in future research are also discussed.}

Recently, the seafood supply chain networks have encountered obstacles that new sustainability regulations and the pandemic have brought forward. In this study, a novel supply chain network is developed for fresh seafood, considering sustainability aspects, to ideally balance the financial aspect of the network while enhancing the recycling of waste products. Moreover, four metaheuristics are employed to conquer the computational complexity of exact solution methods. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms in addressing the complexity of the proposed seafood supply chain model, some numerical examples in three different scales are designed. The obtained results from metaheuristic optimizers are assessed based on five effective measures. To facilitate the statistical analysis process, each measure is normalized using the relative deviation index indicator. According to the results obtained from the implementation of metaheuristic algorithms, it can be concluded that the multi-objective grey wolf and multi-objective golden eagle optimizers outperform the other two solution methods in terms of quality of solutions. Therefore, they can be applied efficiently in solving real-world seafood supply chain network problems.}

The goal of this paper is to provide a framework to enhance effectiveness of the stakeholder engagement in projects by systematically ranking the potential conflicts while combining the viewpoints of stakeholders and project management team. For this purpose, we draw on stakeholder theory, value-based management, matrix-based dependency modeling, and Total Quality Management to develop a stakeholder engagement framework while considering fuzzy inputs for reflecting the ambiguities at the project life cycle. The proposed approach is then applied to plan stakeholder engagement in case of a green building project in Iran. Practically, application of the proposed framework facilitates stakeholder engagement for project managers in line with sustainable goals through early assessment of the fields of potential conflicts of interests.}

abstract = {Learning factories represent realistic learning environments for academia and industry in order to develop competencies. The design of learning factories can be facilitated by a configuration system. The configuration of a learning factory describes the selection of factory elements and products. Mathematically this selection can be described by an optimization problem based on a utility function and restrictions. Optimization algorithms facilitate the planning process by selecting the feasible combination of factory elements with the highest utility. This paper describes the methodology to develop a configuration system for learning factories. Customer needs for the configuration system were identified by an explorative stakeholder study: Learning factory developers, operators, and trainers were interviewed with open and partially open questions. These customer needs were then evaluated regarding their importance. The relationship between customer needs and functional requirements is described in a House of quality. To determine the system design systematically, the decomposition principle and the zig-zag process of the Axiomatic Design were applied. Axiomatic Design is a method to design engineering systems including complex systems and software. Consequently, the functional requirements were transformed into design parameters. Design parameters characterize the design of the configuration system.}

abstract = {In an era of global customization, dominating the majority market with a single product has become increasingly difficult and almost impossible for most companies. In contrast, they must provide various product varieties that attract diverse customers, particularly when acquiring distinct market segments. In practice, however, most companies cannot effectively reduce the gap between customer requirements and design characteristics, although this impacts the profitability and future growth of companies. Meanwhile, companies often get stuck in the trade-offs between enhancing product varieties and controlling manufacturing costs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a hybrid framework that combines fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy Kano model with zero-one integer programming (ZOIP) to incorporate customer preferences and customer perceptions into the decision-making process of product configuration. Specifically, fuzzy AHP is used to extract customer preferences for core attributes while fuzzy Kano model is utilized to elicit customer perceptions of optional attributes. Finally, by virtue of ZOIP, the optimal product varieties (smart cameras) for distinct segments are determined by maximizing overall customer utility (OCU) and taking a firm's pricing policy into account.}

In that sense, an important dimension is crises management such as in cases of natural disasters. This scenario calls for a task force in an attempt to predict or solve emergencies, especially in managing and integrating public and private spheres, which in turn are centered on public authorities, service providers, citizens, volunteers and systems. In order to allow the exchange of information and joint actions of those involved entities, the fulfillment of interoperability requirements becomes a critical factor to promote improved performance of the actions taken in these situations. Based on the literature and related worldwide initiatives, the main concerns and attributes of crisis management are identified from the perspective of interoperability. Founded on this knowledge a framework that supports a Disaster Response Management System (DRMS) development cycle is proposed focusing on a diagnostic step based on a multi-criteria decision analysis techniques (MCDA) to assess potential interoperability of a public entity or locality. The proposed MCDA method facilitates the specification of integrated solutions for the public sector to meet interoperability requirements in disaster management (DM) scenarios. In this paper the assessment method was based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process technique (AHP), and applied to a company involved in the DM domain, responsible for the information technology infrastructure of a city in the south of Brazil. The findings show the main gaps of the entity under the interoperability perspective, allowing the identification of key areas for improvement of its DM capabilities coherent to the DRMS deployment process.}

abstract = {The field of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) has recently observed the birth of Decision Support Systems (DSSs) as a solution for overcoming the limitations of previous initiatives. The numerous failures concerning earlier BPR implementations are mostly ascribed to the introduction of best practices from other industrial experiences without proper adaptation to the local specificities, as well as by the inadequate consideration of uncertainty issues within decision making. A considerable amount of DSSs integrates issues dealing with customer opinions and behaviours and takes into account the uncertainties related to the relevance and the implications of the gathered feedbacks. In such a context, the paper describes an algorithmic model (implemented in a computer application) for supporting decision making that quantitatively relates the phases of a business process with its outputs, with reference to the contribution in generating customer value. The proposed decision support method can be advantageously employed especially in those cases characterized by time pressure and impossibility of performing suitable customer surveys. The model sheds light on process value bottlenecks and provides indications about the most beneficial reengineering activities. Context uncertainties are managed by applying Monte Carlo simulation. Such a measure allows evaluating the share of risk ensuing from redesigning certain business process phases.}

Hence, enterprises have acquired the capacity to manage the future of their product portfolio. However, companies that offer a combination of manufactured goods and services as an integrated system or a Product-Service System confront challenging conditions to maintain or increase their market share due to the complex relationship between manufacturing and service production systems. The complexity of a PSS makes it challenging to adapt its physical products to new customer requirements, satisfy new standards, or develop/adopt new technologies because any modification in one part of the system will undoubtedly affect the other. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an approach for managing the development process of a PSS from a broad perspective. The approach presented in this article combines the advantages of the Business Model Canvas to define the crucial functions of a business model with the service blueprinting capacity to represent service processes. The proposal describes a five stages methodology: Conceptualization, Business Model Design, Product-Service System (PSS) Scenarios, Blueprint design, and Validation. The methodology helps the analysis of a PSS from three perspectives: product, use, and result, which are the typical PSS scenarios. A case study applied to a company that distributes purified water is helpful to illustrate the methodology. Finally, the methodology includes some aspects that favor implementing creative and dynamic business models, emphasizing the constant changes in the evolution of products and services.}

To address this issue and extend the specific design innovation for general application, innovation methods of mechanical products have become a hot research topic. However, the currently available innovation methods are limited to specific needs of the market, exhibiting the form of discrete solutions. Thus, the innovation process is not sustainable. To this gap, this study integrates the emerging digital twin technology with engineering innovation theory and knowledge reuse concepts to establish a systematic sustainable innovation pathway (SIP) by inducing characteristic parameters. The pathway spares the demands for designer’s relevant experiences and avail sustainability of existing innovation methods. The derivation of the current SIP can be divided into six steps. To start with, the existing mechanical products based on users and market requirements are analyzed to synthesize general functional requirements. The characteristic parameters corresponding to the functional requirements are derived in the second step. Characteristic parameters are then specified and the potential problems which may occur in the induction of characteristic parameters are preliminarily solved. Digital twin technology is engaged to dynamically induce characteristic parameters. During the induction process, variation of related parameters due to changes in characteristic parameters are monitored. The problems that arise in variation may suggest new schemes, which solutions indicate new innovation directions. Finally, the candidate schemes of mechanical products according to different needs are identified. The formulated innovation plan and direction are archived in a knowledge base to establish a retrievable solution that matches the SIP. The applicability of current SIP is demonstrated by innovative design exemplification of a parking space management system.}

A separate literature review has shown that the four-axis SCARA robot, used extensively in the manufacturing industry due to its advantages in cost, speed and rigidity, is rarely applied to service tasks. In this work these two research gaps are being addressed. A first prototype of an automated supermarket checkout system, exploiting the advantages of the SCARA robot and including machine vision, has been developed.

This article reviews and classifies tools that have been developed to evaluate the environmental requirement of products and to facilitate its integration into the product design process. With the intention of providing designers with a brief guide to selecting the ecodesign tool that best fits a specific case study, a classification was made according to criteria such as: 1) the method applied for the environmental assessment, 2) the product requirements that need to be integrated in addition to the environmental one (multi-criteria approach), 3) whether the tool has a life cycle perspective (i.e. it considers all the stages of the life cycle of a product), 4) the nature of the results (qualitative or quantitative), 5) the stages of the conceptual design process where the tool can be applied, and 6) the methodology taken as a basis for such integration.}

This represents a paradigm shift in technical and professional education, as well as the collaborative processes utilized in creating and maintaining complex multi-stakeholder talent development systems. In doing so, however, this paradigm shift also presents a huge challenge: education and public sectors are typically not familiar with matured product development and (project) management principles and often do not apply proven industry practices to the definition, design, delivery and improvement of their educational products. The evaluation, acceptance and ultimate implementation of those principles departs from the traditional (United States) culture of education, as it applies new instructional design processes, change implementation processes, and feedback/assessment models. Therefore, critical review of such methods, innovative development of transfer options and human factors management in successfully achieving the required systems change were identified, and include explanation, understanding, acceptance, personal development, and trust. Using a case study approach, this paper will analyze several highly visible and innovative adaptations of industry and educational standards which were accepted and released by all relevant stakeholders. By leveraging subject matter experts from both the industry and academic settings, Michigan Advanced Technician Training (MAT2) formed organizational and working teams comprised of the primary government, industry, and academic stakeholder groups and established a workable context for a knowledge transfer of best practice industry standards. Said standards were applied bi-directionally by academic providers and partnering manufacturing enterprises, and now serve as best practice examples for post-secondary systems of apprenticeship education.}

abstract = {This paper describes a framework to formulate a manufacturing strategy based on the House of Quality (HOQ). This method consists of two main phases. The phase I relates what the market wants (the WHATs) with the manufacturing decision categories (the HOWs). The WHATs are expressed as the manufacturing objectives (i.e. cost, quality, delivery, flexibility and innovation) and the HOWs are expressed as the strategic manufacturing decisions areas (such as, facilities, capacity, process technology, new product design and control systems). A matrix is built, where the rows are the WHATs and the columns are the HOWs. The entries of the matrix are the relationships between both types of concepts. The “roof” of the house is the relationships between the manufacturing decisions (the HOWS). The analysis of this House allows managers to generate strategic action plans in order to fill the gap between what the market wants and what manufacturing is achieving. The phase II builds another house, where the WHATs are the manufacturing decision areas and the HOWS are strategic manufacturing plans. In this phase the strategic action plans are ranked. The application of the proposed method in a company that manufactures industrial tanks is shown.}

Neutralizing anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies that develop in patients with hemophilia A and in murine hemophilia A models, clinically termed “inhibitors,” bind to several distinct surfaces on the FVIII-C2 domain. To map these epitopes at high resolution, 60 recombinant FVIII-C2 proteins were generated, each having a single surface-exposed residue mutated to alanine or a conservative substitution. The binding kinetics of these muteins to 11 monoclonal, inhibitory anti-FVIII-C2 antibodies were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance and the results compared with those obtained for wild-type FVIII-C2. Clusters of residues with significantly altered binding kinetics identified “functional” B-cell epitopes, defined as those residues contributing appreciable antigen–antibody avidity. These antibodies were previously shown to neutralize FVIII activity by interfering with proteolytic activation of FVIII by thrombin or factor Xa, or with its binding to phospholipid surfaces, von Willebrand factor, or other components of the intrinsic tenase complex. Fine mapping of epitopes by surface plasmon resonance also indicated surfaces through which FVIII interacts with proteins and phospholipids as it participates in coagulation. Mutations that significantly altered the dissociation times/half-lives identified functionally important interactions within antigen–antibody interfaces and suggested specific sequence modifications to generate novel, less antigenic FVIII proteins with possible therapeutic potential for treatment of inhibitor patients.}

To achieve this, several tools are available to the organizations such as Quality Function Deployment for Environment (QFDE) which is the integration of voice of customer, voice of environment and quality characteristics. In this paper, an integrated QFDE, fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) is proposed for sustainable product design to help companies identify the best design criteria for a specific product. Therefore, the DEMATEL method is used to assume the interdependence of customer attributes and, in addition, fuzzy Maximum Mean de-Entropy (MMDE) algorithm is utilized to choose the best and practical threshold value in DEMATEL process. Moreover, FANP will be integrated into QFDE as a prioritization technique and also fuzzy Logarithmic Least Squares Method (LLSM) is employed to find weights during the FANP process. An integrated QFDE methodology is appropriate to use in early design, since it does not require detailed information about the product. In order to examine the practicality of the proposed model, a case study is carried out in Iran Transfo Corporation which attracts a significant interest due to its undeniable impacts on the environment.}

The cladogram is produced by the widely used biological Cladistics analysis, without modification. This approach has a great degree of simplicity without introducing an extra layer of mathematical modelling, while resulting in a data-inclusive graphical representation. A case study of automated and flexible assembly is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its simplicity.

This study introduces an integrative framework of Kano's model and FQFD applied to Taiwanese Ban-Doh banquet services. Kano's model with fuzzy sets was used and integrated into the FQFD method to show the relation between service attributes and customer responses. Kano's model categorizes service attributes into three major groups: Must-be, One-dimensional and Attractive. The findings of a case study involving six senior Ban-Doh chefs and 80 guests who attended Ban-Doh banquets are presented. By focusing on the quality of service characteristics that satisfy customers, this study enables service providers and managers to determine the extent to which they can prioritize the improvement of service design in Ban-Doh banquet services to satisfy customer expectations.}

However, although sustainability issues and decarbonization have attracted scholars' attention in various terms for the airline industry, we identified some significant theoretical and managerial gaps as follows: (i) the number of studies evaluating sustainable suppliers by airlines via multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches are very few, (ii) the extant literature has no paper addressing airlines' SAF supplier selection process, and (iii) no widely established criteria set in the literature to evaluate the SAF suppliers for airlines. We propose a novel model for the decision-making process of airlines' sustainable SAF supplier selection, including 39 criteria from 5 aspects considering the triple bottom of sustainability. The proposed model involves the combination of the logarithmic percentage change-driven objective weighting (LOPCOW) and measurement alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) approaches' extended forms based on the interval-valued fuzzy neutrosophic numbers (IVFNN). A comprehensive sensitivity and comparison control is further exploited to display the developed framework's robustness and practicality. Our results suggest that airlines prioritize the green initiatives of SAF suppliers over the economic aspect in the process of sustainable SAF supplier selection. We provide some managerial and policy insights for practitioners and policy-makers in the airline industry and some directions for further research.}

This study depicts a conceptual service design framework, called design-oriented systematic inventive thinking (DSIT) approach, which can be applied in different problem contexts. DSIT is presented as a new systematic and collaborative intelligence approach for creating and evaluating complex service systems using multi-criteria data analytics. DSIT synthesizes the current field of TRIZ service-design knowledge system and the emerging area of non-TRIZ service-design knowledge system. DSIT enables integrated development of service offerings at four dimensions and provides the matching integrated service design approach for each dimension. Four types of service design approaches are conceptualized as “human-independent service engineering,” “problem-clarified service engineering,” “solution-converged service engineering,” and “designing for service.” A new service computer-aided design system (service CAD) named DSIT explorer is developed consisting of customization, compatibility, and extensiveness of DSIT modules. A pervasive and smart collaborative service system (i.e., the smart MOS burger service solution) designed using DSIT explorer is illustrated. DSIT is a holistic, interdisciplinary, and collaborative service design concept, which is incorporated into a collaborative and intelligent service CAD framework to enable systematic inventive thinking throughout phases of service design lifecycle from problem definition, problem resolution, to solution evaluation.}

The oysters settled on a patchy network of limestone platforms (hairãt) and provided a suite of ecosystem services to the surrounding marine environment. Commercially important fish species are associated with hairãt and as a result, industrial fishing with traps focused on these areas. This study has shown that heavily-fished areas are presently in a state which can be considered non-favorable to conservation while areas closed to fishing are recovering. It is probable that an increase in fishing activity using traditional Gargoor traps and grapple retrieval are responsible for the current ecological status of the hairãt. The intensity in trap fishing appears to be having a detrimental effect on species such as corals, sea grasses and oysters. The decline in the standing stock of oysters is dramatic with an estimated reduction ratio of 580:1 between 2002 and 2016. As fishing damage appears to be a significant contributor to these losses, measures such as spatial protection of productive shallow offshore habitats and restriction on fishing effort are urgently required to address the decline. Strategic oyster stock enhancement through the re-seeding of selected areas could boost the recovery of damaged hairãt as P. radiata ecosystem services return.}

This research investigated the conceptual design phase of new microplasma devices in order to create metrics that evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and overall utility of representative MADM systems studied in previous engineering design applications. Device attributes and concept alternatives for the microplasma devices were identified from open-ended expert surveys. Efficiency metrics were defined based on the number of manual user inputs. Published device literature and testing were used to gauge how closely device concepts satisfied multi-attribute criteria, forming the basis of an effectiveness metric. A weighted average of the efficiency and effectiveness defined a MADM system’s overall utility. Varying the effectiveness weight provided further insight into the conditions under which particular MADM approaches exhibited higher utility values. The MADM systems found to possess the highest overall quantified utilities were based on Pugh’s controlled convergence, Utility Based Axiomatic Framework, and Grey Relational Analysis. The MADM method with the lowest overall utility was the analytical hierarchy process. These findings indicate that consensus building and utility-based MADM systems are especially helpful to engineering design teams during the early design phases of novel technologies when resources are constrained or historical data is limited.}

In the past, a plethora of eco-design tools that address only the environmental aspect have been developed. Hence, previous review articles focused mainly on eco-design tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and others. Unlike previous studies, the main contribution of this article was to review and analyze the recent and emerging product design tools (published from 2007 to 2017) which considered other dimensions of sustainability along with the environment. Based on the criteria of sustainability dimensions, this paper proposed a generic and broader classification scheme to enhance the understanding of these recent tools. Those which included two aspects of sustainability were categorized as partial sustainable product design (P-SPD) tools, and those which covered three aspects of sustainability were classified as sustainable product design (SPD) tools. The analysis revealed that SPD tools were less mature and standard as compared to P-SPD tools. The majority of both P-SPD and SPD tools were based on a life cycle perspective. However, P-SPD tools were found to be more useful at early design stages. In addition, this paper presented the case studies of the tools to decipher their practical utility. It also discussed the hurdles and problems associated with the methodological development and practical utility of the tools. Founded on these difficulties, future research directions were presented. In essence, a coordinated and responsible effort among practitioners, governments, societies and researchers is needed to ensure the successful implementation of the tools.}

The scope of the IVHM design included consideration of data collection and communication from the continuous monitoring of aircraft systems, observation of current system states, and processing of this data to support proper maintenance and repair actions. Legacy commercial platforms and HM applications for various subsystems of these aircraft were identified. The list of possible applications was down-selected to a reduced number that offer the highest value using a QFD matrix based on the cost benefit analysis. Requirements, designs and system architectures were developed for these applications. The application areas considered included engine, tires and brakes, pneumatics and air conditioning, generator, and structures.

The work concluded with observations on nature of HM, the technologies, and the approaches and challenges to its integration into the current avionics, support system and business infrastructure. The IVHM design for All Electric Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) Aircraft has a challenging task of addressing and resolving the shortfalls in the legacy IVHM framework. The challenges like sensor battery maintenance, handling big data from SHM, On-Ground Data transfer by light, Extraction of required features at sensor nodes/RDCUs, ECAM/EICAS Interfaces, issues of certification of wireless SHM network has been addressed in this paper. Automatic Deployable Flight Data recorders are used in the design of HWB aircraft in which critical flight parameters are recorded. The component selection of IVHM system including software and hardware have been based on the COTS technology. The design emphasis on high levels of reliability and maintainability. The above systems are employed using IMA and integrated on AFDX data bus. The design activities has to pass through design reviews on systematic basis and the overall approach has been to make system highly lighter, effective “All weather” compatible and modular. It is concluded from the study of advancement in IVHM capabilities and new service offerings that IVHM technology is emerging as well as challenging.

The transit-oriented development (TOD) model has become one of the effective priority solutions. TOD planning gives us an idea that urban design factors and a pedestrian-friendly design are positive planning factors in reducing automobile use through the reduction of automobile traffic speed and enhancing pedestrian accessibility to a transit center. To investigate the pedestrian needs and the walkability design for TOD is the aim for aiding in identifying an approach that would allow an appropriate assessment of the walking environment and justification for improvements. The purpose of this study is to improve and enhance the city design of the pedestrian space in a city. Furthermore, we hope to meet the needs of users and utilize the existing resources in order to achieve the maximum benefits. To solve this complex problem, we apply multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique to the specific problem. Using the top down and bottom up together technique named house of quality (HOQ) matrix combined with analytic network process (ANP), we can realize the relationships between the technical requirements and the pedestrian needs of the planning and design issues of the walkability under the transit-oriented development. In this way, we can establish an objective and effective urban pedestrian space design model.

abstract = {A product-service system (PSS) has many engineering characteristics (ECs), their design is a critical work in PSS planning, which has an important influence on the cost and quality of PSS. How to design a reasonable PSS-ECs scheme, and evaluate its life cycle cost (LCC) is a challenging task. Aiming at the PSS-ECs design for LCC, this paper proposes a new PSS design method, it first treats and models the design of PSS-ECs as a customer requirements-based constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for finding an initial set of satisfied PSS-ECs schemes, and then it evaluates these schemes based on Bayesian network (BN)-based LCC estimation model for finding an optimal scheme as a solution. Constructing a BN describing the uncertain relationships between PSS-ECs and LCC is the core of this research. By combining existing R&D data and expert experience, Bayesian estimation and arithmetic averaging are used to estimate the conditional probability in BN. Take a subway bogie and its maintenance service in a Chinese company as an example to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of PSS-ECs design for LCC, it also shows that this method has positive significance in realizing engineering knowledge consolidation, assisting designers in exploring design space, and improving the rationality of design decisions.}

abstract = {Led by the goals of energy saving and low emissions, tractors need more efficient operations under complex farmland working environments. The powertrain architecture of the tractor has a significant influence on the performance. Therefore, the research on the innovative design of the tractor powertrain architecture can improve the efficiency, energy saving, and environmental protection effects. Based on the creative design method of Axiomatic Design (AD) and Extenics, this paper conducts an innovative design analysis of the powertrain architecture of distributed hybrid electric tractor (DHET). Firstly, AD is used to perform the hierarchical analysis of the tractor powertrain architecture design. Then according to the design content, the design matrix (DM) is established, and the matrix is transformed to extract the 3 × 3 coupling contradiction matrix. Finally, the application of Extenics solves the contradictions in the innovative design of the tractor powertrain architecture. Simulation and prototype experiments have proved that DHET has the advantages of energy saving and emission reduction. This paper analyzes the innovative design of DHET's powertrain architecture, which can provide a theoretical basis and method support for the product's innovative design.}

Four different amorphization techniques were used: quenching of the melt, milling, spray-drying, and freeze-drying, and amorphous samples were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Special attention was paid to the tautomeric composition and to the glass transition of amorphized materials. It was found that the tautomeric composition of the starting physical state (crystal, liquid, or solution) is preserved during the amorphization process and has a strong repercussion on the glass transition of the material. The correlation between these two properties as well as the plasticizing effect of the different tautomers was clarified by molecular dynamics simulations.

The automotive industry is one example of an emerging fashion based industry. The objective of most viable businesses is to make a profit for their shareholders but, given the typical gestation period between concept establishment and the start of the production volume build, it is a challenge to establish a structured method to ensure programme and business profitability against the backdrop of a fashion based market. In this paper, a data driven methodology is proposed which focuses on data, structure, and the customer to maximise the probability of profitability. To achieve this goal, joins between Multi Criteria Decision Analysis, Parametric Cost Estimating and ‘Should’ Cost Estimating are explored. ‘Margin engineering’ is thus proposed as a new foundation for a future business model to guide medium term (one to six years) development projects towards a profitable outcome.}

The platform enables the shift from the traditional manufacturing process, which is driven by research and marketing, toward a customer-centric product development process. However, a challenge arises as customers lack technical knowledge to communicate their product specifications effectively, creating a semantic gap. This paper proposes a soft prompt-based network structure that utilizes pretrained language models to bridge the semantic gap on the C2M platform. To address limited customer needs data and imbalanced classes, a large corpus of product review texts is used to establish a mapping between reviews and product specifications. A smaller set of customer needs text is then employed to adapt this mapping to the target customer needs-product specifications relationship, thereby closing the semantic gap. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model adaptation operation and the prompting structure. Additionally, the experiments highlight the robustness of the proposed method against variations in training data size, thereby mitigating the challenges posed by imbalanced classes. The proposed method could potentially bring innovation to product customization and C2M platform development. By bridging the semantic gap, companies can better integrate customers in the co-design process and effectively translate customer needs into actionable product specifications.}

Background & aims
Diabetes causes impairment of various enzyme activities in the physiological system, including lysosomal enzymes. The effect of feeding curcumin, quercetin and aminoguanidine on lysosomal enzyme activities viz., N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, β-d-glucuronidase, β-d-galactosidase and acid phosphatase were studied in different tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
Method
Rats were divided into four control groups and four diabetic groups. Experimental groups were fed with diet supplemented with curcumin (0.5%) or quercetin (0.1%) or aminoguanidine (0.05%). Lysosomal enzyme activities were determined in various tissues.
Results
The specific activity of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase in liver of diabetic rats was decreased when compared to control rats and was ameliorated with curcumin and quercetin treatment by 67% and 78%, respectively. On the other hand, β-d-glucuronidase activity was higher in the brain of diabetic rats (0.90 ± 0.04 nmol/mg protein/min), when compared to control rats (0.45 ± 0.02 nmol/mg protein/min) and was decreased in curcumin (0.75 ± 0.05 nmol/mg protein/min) and quercetin (0.74 ± 0.11 nmol/mg protein/min) treated rats. β-d-galactosidase activity in spleen of curcumin and quercetin fed diabetic group rats was ameliorated by 68% and 58%, respectively, in comparison to diabetic rats. Acid phosphatase activity in diabetic rats decreased in testis when compared to control.
Conclusion
Curcumin and quercetin feeding modulated lysosomal enzyme activities in different tissues during diabetes and the effect was comparable to well-known anti-glycative agent - aminoguanidine.}

The study also evaluates the static and dynamic risk indicators related to the transportation of crude oil. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is found to be a promising option for crude oil shipments, reducing the risks associated with current routes. Using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology, the research determines China's most efficient crude oil supply channel using a fuzzy-based Improved TOPSIS approach. The economic feasibility of the CPEC option has been confirmed through a thorough cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Additionally, the optimal mode of transportation from CPEC seaports to Western China is determined using the fuzzy-based Improved TOPSIS method. The MCDM criteria considered in all scenarios include time, financial outlays, energy consumption, environmental impact, and security risks. The results indicate that the CPEC route and the maritime route via Myanmar outperform the conventional route that passes through the seaports of Eastern China. This study emphasizes the significant advancement in decision-making in crude oil transportation made possible by the fuzzy-based Improved TOPSIS technique.}

This study focuses on developing a benchmarking technique to measure the degree to which energy management systems are utilized in metro stations by reviewing the broad literature in energy management in the transportation and construction sectors and exploring the techniques used to reduce energy consumption. A System Application Matrix is constructed using the Quality Function Development approach and Analytic Hierarchy Process in which the model has three main energy management categories: an energy efficiency system, a renewable energy system and a recovery energy system. Each main category includes a subcategory or subcategories. For example, the LED lighting system, walls insulation and platform screen doors are the subcategories of the energy efficiency system. Solar panel is the only subcategory of the renewable energy efficiency system and energy storage is also the only subcategory of the recovery energy system. The optimal design of these five subcategories will be provided for developing the System Application Matrix. Furthermore, the System Application Matrix is validated via industry and academia experts’ input, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process and piloted on theoretical data runs. After prioritizing the experts’ judgments, the energy efficiency system had the highest priority (61.2%) compared to the two other main categories of the energy management system. Consequently, after Quality Function Development matrix analysis, LED lighting had the highest level of importance by almost 29.1%. The next highest elements were wall insulation and platform screen doors by almost 26.2%. Solar panels, with 9.8%, and energy storage, with 8.7%, were the last two elements in terms of relative importance. Ultimately, the System Application Matrix, which is a “Best in Class” benchmarking model, is considered to be an integration model providing both government and private sectors with the ability to measure the level of importance of applied energy management elements in metro stations.}

Blockchain is one of the pioneering transformative 4.0 technologies and is seen as the backbone of digital SCs (DSCs). Several attempts have been made to create explorative designs or models, however, forming a strategic Blockchain vision remains a challenge. This paper specifies those customer needs and design requirements that should be prioritized with a systematic approach for effective Blockchain integration into SCs. The proposed functional methodology provides a practical roadmap for practitioners. It is based on the House of Quality (HoQ) method, with its customer-focused design aspect, utilizing a group decision making (GDM) approach with an incomplete intuitionistic fuzzy relation (IIFR) extension. The GDM approach is employed to overcome the biases of decision making, while IIFRs deal with different or complementary focus centers in qualitative data. The usefulness of this methodology is tested with an application, and the results are validated by experts in the field. The results indicate that a Blockchain-based DSC (BC-DSC) is expected to deliver continuing financial benefit, efficient use of time, and the ability to support. Automation, effective coordination, and conformity are identified as highly critical design requirements. GDM and IIFR are combined for the first time in the literature. The originality of this paper comes from its generation of critical factors geared to obtaining an effective BC-DSC structure and the implementation of HoQ as an efficient tool for design.}

Packaging with air inside initially was used as the atmosphere treatment (AIR). In respect to color changes, total color difference and browning index showed the greatest range for HNP and the smallest range for LOP. Regarding sensory analysis, LOP and AIR had the best results for overall quality compared to LCP and HNP. Odor characteristics were best scored for LOP while AIR had the worst impact on this feature. The highest level of quality deterioration was observed for LCP and HNP mushrooms while AIR mushrooms had the lowest level of deterioration. Quality function deployment showed that the best 'Quality Score' was for LOP, followed by AIR. LCP and HNP had the worst 'Quality Score' during the entire shelf-life.}

Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is scarcely any discussion on its design theories, which serves as the fundamental basis. To identify the limitations of current design approaches in supporting Smart PSS development and suggest some future research directions, this paper conducts a systematic literature review at existing engineering design methodologies to verify its appropriateness for the Smart PSS development. 9 typical design methods have been chosen based on the systematic review of 101 representative items published ever since the coin of PSS to date (04/05/2020) and 48 supplementary works. They are further compared and evaluated from three aspects, including “smart design” objects, enabling smart technologies and smart application fields. Not surprisingly, the investigation results indicate that none of the existing methodologies can fully meet the design characteristics of Smart PSS, while three research directions of Smart PSS design methodology are provided as the potential solution at last. It is hoped this paper can attract more open discussions and offer useful insights to both academics and industries in their development of Smart PSS.}

Then, we can extract quality characteristics according to image words and credible customer requirements. The weights of the quality characteristics are deduced by refining characteristics through a house of quality reconstruction and mapping customer requirements to characteristics. Finally, based on related theories or viewpoints, the operating practices for quality characteristics entail quantitative output with importance and grades taken into consideration. Our experimental results demonstrate that operating practices can help managers understand e-commerce service quality and have useful implications for companies in the management of e-commerce service quality.}

Meanwhile, the methodological investigation of how to generate new combinations with potentially high values, especially based on consumer demands, is still very less common. This article is among the first efforts to cope with consumer demand based recombinant search to generate technology opportunities or ideas with potentially high values. Since function is the most important concept in determining an invention’s basic characteristics, which greatly relate to and influence consumer demands, we first propose a conceptual recombinant search framework, where functions serve as the role of a bridge between technologies and demands. We then propose a four-phase solution to implement the proposed conceptual framework. Empirically, the proposed methodology is finally applied to the rehabilitation robot industry, which is characterized by a huge market size with fierce competition, immature development as well as the importance of considering consumer demands. The results show that: 1) greater familiarity does not necessarily induce more higher consumer satisfaction; 2) there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of recombination and the overall consumer satisfaction; and 3) our model outperforms three baseline models in terms of quantity rate and quality rate for the ideas generated.}

Recently, the idea of Ptolemaic indexing was introduced, which substitutes Ptolemy's inequality for the triangular one, potentially yielding higher efficiency for the distances where it applies. In this paper we have adapted several metric indexes to support Ptolemaic indexing, thus establishing a class of Ptolemaic access methods (PtoAM). In particular, we include Ptolemaic Pivot tables, Ptolemaic PM-Trees and the Ptolemaic M-Index. We also show that the most important and promising family of distances suitable for Ptolemaic indexing is the signature quadratic form distance, an adaptive similarity measure which can cope with flexible content representations of multimedia data, among other things. While this distance has shown remarkable qualities regarding the search effectiveness, its high computational complexity underscores the need for efficient search methods. We show that these distances are Ptolemaic metrics and present a study where we apply Ptolemaic indexing methods on real-world image databases, resolving exact queries nearly four times as fast as the state-of-the-art metric solution, and up to three orders of magnitude times as fast as sequential scan.}

The current study establishes a model-based method to support design teams in making informed multi-criteria decisions for energy-efficiency solutions at the early design stage. The key feature of the hybrid framework is the integration of an analysis procedure carried out by a design team and a numerical procedure of optimization carried out by computer. Such an interaction is necessary as building design and retrofit requires many qualitative aspects that require human judgment. In contrast to previous approaches, this study provides a basis for embedding multi-objective optimization into the decision making on energy retrofit solutions, which considers the important role of stakeholders by carrying out the analysis procedure. An office building in Germany needing an energy retrofit serves as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.}

The diversity of PHM algorithms and the complexity of design factors make it challenging to choose an appropriate algorithm for a specific application. Consequently, automatic PHM algorithm recommendation (PHM-AR) is of great significance for PHM developers to implement rapid design of PHM systems. However, the two existing paradigms for PHM-AR rely heavily on expert experience and failure data respectively. In this paper, we propose a new third paradigm, called the case-learning-based paradigm, for quantitative recommendation of fault diagnosis algorithms, focusing on diagnosis task attribute analysis, multi-dimensional feature representation, and recommendation model construction. Specifically, to provide a quantitative basis for the recommendation of diagnosis algorithms, we define a three-level attribute set of diagnosis tasks and propose a quantitative representation method to make data structured. Then, a recommendation model based on the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) is proposed. Finally, taking gearbox as an example, we construct a diagnosis case set and verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results show that the average recommendation accuracy of our proposed method reaches 70.40%. These results also elucidate that the proposed method can learn the applicable rules of various diagnosis algorithms.}

Traditional product redesign can identify functional requirements from customer needs by functional analysis and utilize inventive principles of TRIZ to address the problems. However, the relationships between the customer needs (CNs), engineering parameters (EPs), and inventive principles (IPs) has not been explored, which may limit and hinder the opportunity for product innovation. To improve the design efficiency, Random Forest (RF) is introduced in this method to mine the relationship between EPs and IPs by researching many cases for design knowledge. A systematic redesign process is proposed to apply the design knowledge. Firstly, functional analysis is used to decompose customer needs (CNs) into product functions. And then, the effect-based approach which is the application of scientific laws is used to transform functions into EPs. Secondly, IPs are recommended based on EPs by a trained RF model. Finally, the specific solution is generated from the problem domain using the analogy design based on the Su-Field model. The effectiveness of the method is verified in the redesign of solar power systems for unmanned transport ships.}

abstract = {Achieving sustainability in product life cycle involves the complex decision making process such as the selection of conceptual schemes and manufacturing processes, and disposing method of end-of-life. Morphological matrix is simple and useful tool for mapping design requirements in conceptual design for new product design and redesign of out-of-date product. Although conceptual design using morphological matrix as an important step in the product development could achieve sustainability requirements through accurate choice, quantitative decision making method is seldom considered in selection of function solution principle for sustainability. Meanwhile, uncertainties of sustainability attributes in conceptual stage generally are not also considered in these morphological matrix. To solve these problems, this paper put forward an approach based on morphological matrix to satisfy sustainability requirements in product conceptual stage considering vagueness and uncertainty through intuitionistic fuzzy number. The aim of this paper is to quantify conceptual schemes considering sustainability attributes using group decision making and intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. The decision makers’ weights are calculated based on theirs experiences and knowledge on the function, manufacturing, economic, environment, recycle and social properties of product. The morphological matrix is used to establish the relationship between function and solution principles based on sustainability information, then the preference degree are obtained from multiple experts employing intuitionistic fuzzy judgment matrix. The preference degree for each solution principle is quantified by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers through membership, non-membership and hesitancy degree to express the linguistic terminology. To ensure the consistency and consensus issues of preference relations, an additive consistency method is employed, and correction factor is used for achieving modification automatically of judgment matrix when the consistency requirement is not met. Finally, the integrated multi-criteria decision model for function solution principle is established to carry out the final sustainability decision problem in early design stage. The feasibility and validity of proposed method is proved through a practical example for spindle system design of CNC.}

The DAQ (directly-asked-question) model is a simple approach to find the most accurate Kano fuzzy categories. By using consumer responses towards 13 popular sports lesson programs in Korea, this study tries to show the adjustment of the cut-off points on typical 4 by 4 matrixes in Kano model and Kano fuzzy model.

abstract = {Product–service system (PSS) planning has been attracting attentions of global manufacturers to change from providing only products to offering both products and their services as a whole. The PSS planning approach can maintain the functionality of products for customers throughout the whole product life-cycle. Identification of the product and service parameters in early design stages plays a critical role in PSS development. The PSS planning is usually started by the mapping from customer requirements (CRs) in the customer domain to engineering characteristics (ECs), including product-related ECs (P-ECs) and service-related ECs (S-ECs), in the functional domain. In this paper, a systematic decision-making approach for PSS planning is developed to determine the optimal fulfillment levels of ECs considering requirements of customers and manufacturers. The PSS planning is conducted through four phases. First, the initial weights of ECs considering customer needs are achieved based on fuzzy pairwise comparison. Second, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is applied to obtain the final weights of ECs considering customer requirements as well as other requirements of the manufacturers. Third, the ECs are categorized into different Kano attribute classes using fuzzy Kano’s questionnaire (FKQ) and fuzzy Kano’s mode (FKM) for evaluation of the PSS. In the last phase, non-linear programming is carried out to maximize the fulfillment levels of ECs. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed optimal PSS planning approach.}

abstract = {To address conflicts arising during the innovative product design process, a dynamic evolution of conflicts and their relationships leads to the emergence of a new set of conflicts termed as “conflict flow.” Initially, a product elemental network is created by analyzing the relevance of the improved product. The elemental nodes in this network undergo extensible conduction transformation which helps extract elemental conduction paths and identify conflicts. Subsequently, a scale-free conflict network is constructed using graph theory, and key conflicts are determined and resolved using TRIZ tools. Through iterative iterations, the conflict flows in the improvement design process are discovered and resolved. Furthermore, this research proposes a method for elemental conduction transformation and conflict determination rules based on conduction paths. It also describes the processes involved in constructing both the elemental network and the scale-free conflict network. Ultimately, the study establishes an iterative construction process model for conflict flow networks based on Extensible Conduction Transformation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, a case study is conducted involving the improvement design of an engineering mechanical Lead-acid battery plate testing equipment.}

abstract = {As intelligent interaction systems evolve, ergonomic requirements (ERs) for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have become increasingly complex and subjective. Inadequate evaluation during the GUI prototype design phase can lead to significant challenges in later development and testing. To address this issue, we propose a novel Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach that integrates rough set (RS) theory, linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy set (LPFS), and models relationships among decision makers (DMs). Specifically, we introduce linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy rough numbers (LPFRNs) to capture DM groups' uncertain and interrelated opinions on ERs, accounting for linguistic uncertainty and inherent roughness. We detail the construction of LPFRNs, including operation rules and aggregation operators based on the Dombi t-norm (DTN) and t-conorm(DTCN), and establish ranking rules and distance measures. By incorporating a DM objective weight determination method based on similarity measures, we enhance the precision of the DEMATEL model. Applying this method, we construct a hierarchical system of 31 ERs based on six GUI design elements (DEs) and evaluate their importance. Our findings reveal that layout-related ERs are critically significant, providing valuable insights for GUI designers to prioritize ERs effectively. The novelty of this work lies in integrating LPFRN and its aggregation operator into the DEMATEL method, which can better meet the complex and subjective correlation evaluation. Potential applications include automated evaluation of GUI design quality and optimization of the design process. We validated the robustness and feasibility of our method through sensitivity and comparative analysis.}

abstract = {In the past decades, the rapid urbanisation has driven the prosperity of building industry, which, however, has led to the consumption of enormous amounts of energy and resources and the continued deterioration of the environment owing to its unsustainable development. These outcomes impact seriously the ecosystems and human health. In order to promote the sustainable performance of building sector, the widely adoption of sustainable building materials has been considered as one of the most promising ways toward this endeavor. This paper aims at addressing the problem of sustainable building material selection (SBMS) under uncertain context by developing an integrated multi-criteria large-group decision-making framework. In the proposed framework, the assessment information is characterised in the form of Improved Basic Uncertain Linguistic Information (IBULI), which incorporates reliable degrees of decision experts that can accurately quantify subjective assessment information provided under uncertainty. The weights of assessment criteria for SBMS are determined by the Quality Function Deployment-based method that is capable of accommodating the influences of multiple stakeholders and the fields of conflicts amongst them. Subsequently, the assessment information given by a large-group of decision experts are aggregated by IBULI-aggregation operators guided by an IBULI-based correlation- and consensus-driven clustering method, which achieves the classification of large-scale decision experts and the satisfied consensus level simultaneously. The selection of sustainable building materials is eventually accomplished by the IBULI-based Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method. Finally, an illustrative example accompanied by sensitivity and comparative analyses is performed to verify the rationality and feasibility of the proposed model.}

There are three issues in the halal supply chain that could describe its close relationship with sustainability. The first is halal integrity to ensure the halal-ness of a product. The second is the limited adoption of halal supply chain, and the third issue is limited number of studies that discuss sustainability in halal supply chain. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few researches in halal supply chain, particularly which consider sustainability in halal supply chain and which apply operation research (OR) method. The literature review is done through a comprehensive review of publications from 2000 to 2022. The review papers are classified based on eight categories in the taxonomy developed in this study. This paper may contribute to giving comprehensive review and identifying research challenges in sustainable halal supply chain optimization with OR approach. Based on the review, halal supply chain studies have been showing an increasing trend starting from 2011. Most publications are from Malaysia, while Indonesia comes second even though Indonesia has the largest Moslem population in the world. Most of the studies focus on whole supply chain and strategic decision level. Limited research is found in operation level decision. Most of the study focus on the study of food and beverages. Only a few studies have considered sustainability issue in halal supply chain. The review found that there is a balance between the application of quantitative and qualitative approach in halal supply chain. However artificial intelligence (AI) approach has not yet been applied in the research area of halal supply chain. Based on those findings, it is necessary to conduct more studies in the area of halal supply chain and relate it with sustainability using OR/AI methodology.}

The proposed process uses system-engineering-based requirement-analysis techniques such as objective tree, analytic hierarchy process, and quality function deployment to establish logical and quantitative standards. Moreover, in order to perform a logical selection of alternative aircraft configurations, it uses advanced decision-making methods such as morphological matrix and technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution. In addition, a preliminary sizing tool has been developed to check the feasibility of the established performance requirements and to evaluate the flight performance of the selected configurations. The present process has been applied for a two-seater very light aircraft (VLA), resulting in a set of tentative design requirements and two families of VLA configurations: a high-wing configuration and a low-wing configuration. The resulting set of design requirements consists of three categories: customer requirements, certification requirements, and performance requirements. The performance requirements include two mission requirements for the flight range and the endurance by reflecting the customer requirements. The flight performances of the two configuration families were evaluated using the sizing tool developed and the low-wing configuration with conventional tails was selected as the best baseline configuration for the VLA.}

The froth flotation cell can be represented by a non-linear phenomenological state-space model. The states of the model are the concentration of minerals in the froth and the pulp, and the volume of liquid in the froth and pulp. A state controllability analysis of the model indicates that the states are controllable using air flow-rate, tailings flow-rate, and feed-rate as manipulated variables. Therefore, given these three manipulated variables, a controller should be able to maximise the separation between minerals in the concentrate and tailings, while maintaining a pulp level within acceptable bounds.}

Failing to satisfy customer requirements can damage a company's reputation and cause heavy losses. In this study, we have developed a new approach for properly interpreting and analyzing the fuzzy voice of the customer using association rule learning and text mining. This unique methodology converts textual and qualitative data into a common quantitative format which is then used to develop a mapped Integrated Customer Satisfaction Index (ICSI). ICSI is a framework for measuring customer satisfaction. Previous measures of customer satisfaction ratio failed to incorporate the cost implications of resolving customer complaints/issues and the fuzzy impact of those complaints/issues on the system. In addition to including these important and unique factors in the present study, we have also introduced a dynamic Critical to Quality (CTQ) concept, a novel method that provides a real-time system to monitor the CTQ list through an updated CTQ library. Finally, a procedure for customer feedback mining and sentiment analysis is proposed that handles typographical errors, which are unavoidable in every real database. The results of this study suggest that incorporating the fuzzy level of negativity and positivity of comments into the model instead of treating negative and positive comments as binary variables, leads to more reasonable outcomes.

First, an “imagery–part library–virtual simulation” product design model is established through the integration of Kansei engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) drawing technology to construct a virtual part library. Assembly experiments are then conducted using a virtual simulation platform. Subsequently, a combined evaluation model, based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and behavioral experiments, is developed to evaluate and screen plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from both the component and whole-system perspectives. Finally, the final scheme is simulated and optimized from the perspective of aerodynamics. This paper analyzes the modeling of plant protection UAVs from aesthetic and engineering viewpoints. It quantifies aesthetic requirements through various methods and integrates cutting-edge AI-assisted design and virtual simulation technology to optimize the initial product design process and consequently reduce the subjectivity of the product modeling process. The proposed methodology holds both theoretical and practical significance for the modeling design of agricultural machinery equipment.}
