abstract = {This paper concerns the application of Process Control Techniques (PCTs) for the improvement of the technical performance of discrete production processes. Successful applications of these techniques, such as Statistical Process Control Techniques (SPC), can be found in the literature. However, some companies do not manage to apply PCTs successfully. In some cases applying PCTs does not lead to an improvement of the technical performance, or it leads to a reduced financial performance. Lack of management commitment and training are often said to be the reason for a failing implementation. However, it is probable that also situational factors, related to the type of process and production organisation, are influencing the degree of success. Besides the success of implementation activities, the potential success or applicability of PCTs is also determining the total success. In the literature however, one often starts from the point of a ‘best practice’ for the application of PCTs. Considering the assumption of applicability this ‘best practice’ has to be differentiated to prevent companies from trying to implement unsuitable PCTs. In this paper, besides the concept of applicability, a framework for the application of PCTs is presented. By using this framework, the functions of PCTs and their relationships are illustrated. The framework has been developed as a tool for a research on the applicability of PCTs. The aim of this research is to differentiate the best practice concept. This has to result in a decision support system, that helps to determine the most suitable set of techniques, based on situational characteristics.}

As each designer has his/her own subjective opinion, an appropriate link between the user requirements and design features must be carefully developed to generate the most suitable design recommendation. The objective of this research is to develop a component design approach for the generation and evaluation of feasible design alternatives to help designers make the most effective design decisions. The development of the approach is based on the concept of component design and interaction links between user requirements and design output parameter values so that the design alternatives can be generated. A confidence interval for order statistics is then used to determine if enough unique feasible design alternatives have been generated. The research is presented in conjunction with a ballpoint pen design to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this approach. The results should provide designers with a useful method for the development of a design information system that will efficiently generate and evaluate a set of feasible design alternatives in product design process.}

abstract = {It has been well recognized that product portfolio planning has far-reaching impact on the company's business success in competition. In general, product portfolio planning involves two main stages, namely portfolio identification and portfolio evaluation and selection. The former aims to capture and understand customer needs effectively and accordingly to transform them into specifications of product offerings. The latter concerns how to determine an optimal configuration of these identified offerings with the objective of achieving best profit performance. Current research and industrial practice have mainly focused on the economic justification of a given product portfolio, whereas the portfolio identification issue has been received only limited attention. This article intends to develop explicit decision support to improve product portfolio identification by efficient knowledge discovery from past sales and product records. As one of the important applications of data mining, association rule mining lends itself to the discovery of useful patterns associated with requirement analysis enacted among customers, marketing folks, and designers. An association rule mining system (ARMS) is proposed for effective product portfolio identification. Based on a scrutiny into the product definition process, the article studies the fundamental issues underlying product portfolio identification. The ARMS differentiates the customer needs from functional requirements involved in the respective customer and functional domains. Product portfolio identification entails the identification of functional requirement clusters in conjunction with the mappings from customer needs to these clusters. While clusters of functional requirements are identified based on fuzzy clustering analysis, the mapping mechanism between the customer and functional domains is incarnated in association rules. The ARMS architecture and implementation issues are discussed in detail. An application of the proposed methodology and system in a consumer electronics company to generate a vibration motor portfolio for mobile phones is also presented.}

The connection is designed as a mechanical pin-type fastener with a general purpose polyester matrix FRP. Full-scale beam tests and small-scale properties test were carried out. Where connection failure took place, the derived connection capacity load matches fairly. A predicted span length of a roof element is in the order of 8–10 m in a design situation should be possible using the FRP–steel web. The load-carrying and thermal insulation performance of FRP–steel, expanded metal and slotted steel beams are compared by finite element analysis.}

Nevertheless, in modern times some infrastructure have become so significant that the future sustainability of the country is dependent on them. Such infrastructure is termed Critical Infrastructure (CI), a term coined in 1995 by the United States of America (USA). Thus, the USA and other developed countries have taken measures to protect and improve the resilience of their CI. However, CI is a new concept, therefore the developing countries are lacking a policy framework that could enhance the robustness of their CI. This paper aims to fill the gap by constructing a framework for the augmentation of resilience in the CI of developing countries like Pakistan. The formulation of the framework is achieved using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) based Fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) technique. FAHP results in the identification of the energy sector as the most important CI whereas FVIKOR identifies data acquisition and monitoring systems as the best resilience strategy. The study recommends to the policymakers of the developing countries to follow the proposed framework of the study to devise relative guidelines for their implementation and ensure the future sustainability of their countries. The devising of a framework for the improvement of CI resilience for developing countries and the practicality of the research based on the case study of Pakistan are the principal novelties of the paper.}

The term Concurrent Engineering, also called Simultaneous Engineering, was used the first time in the US in 1989. It is primarily an expression for the ambition to increase the competitiveness by decreasing the lead-time and still improving quality and cost. The main methodology is to integrate the product development and the development of the design- and production processes. In this way Concurrent Engineering is a label for a development era of the manufacturing technology. To be successful Concurrent Engineering must be based on relevant theories, use efficient tools and be lead by dedicated management. Education and the ability for team work is essential for the success. Many companies are reporting good results from their use of Concurrent Engineering principles. More efficient software tools and manufacturing systems principles are being developed in research projects.}

The development and implementation of practical natural resources and catchment management policies require a comprehensive knowledge of the system processes (biological, physical, and socioeconomic), their complicated interactions, and how they react to different changes. The current research assessed the ecological, physical, and socioeconomic consequences of biologically based management scenarios targeting runoff and soil erosion problems in the Darenari catchment. The Darenari catchment with an approximate area of 554 ha is located in Fars Province, Iran. Three biological activities and 8 management scenarios were considered. Ecological consequences were studied using the weighted land cover area index. Physical effects were investigated applying the Soil Conservation Service hydrologic model. Economic and social effects were assessed applying the cost/benefit analysis as well as examining the outcomes of a social survey. The best scenarios were identified applying a multiple-criteria decision-making technique. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach was applied to weight the criteria. The results indicated that multiple-criteria decision-making is a useful technique for demonstrating the catchment system as a whole, to integrate output from models and expert judgments.}

Although these three measures can each be assessed separately and give us some idea of a supply chain’s capability, a combined measure of all three can provide a more holistic picture and comprehensive understanding of the system. To our knowledge, no attempt has been undertaken to formulate a combined measure. We utilized a data fusion technique called the Dempster Shafer (D–S) theory and developed a comprehensive assessment framework considering all three dimensions of resilience, sustainability, and cyber-security. Further, we combine these three measures into a single measure called the cyber-susiliency index. The proposed framework is applied to a healthcare supply chain and shows reasonable results. Yager’s recursive rule of combination further validates the D–S theory application. An index value is developed on a scale from 0 to 1, representing a numerical measure of the organization’s cyber-susiliency. The cyber-susiliency index for the healthcare supply case was calculated at 0.62 on a 1 to 0 scale.}

Among these, smart product-service system (SPSS) with the unique features of smartness, connection, value co-creation, and data-driven has been widely concerned. Therefore, based on axiomatic design theory, the mapping from function domain to physical domain is a critical process in SPSS's conceptual design and the selecting of design parameters in physical domain has great impact on meeting multi-stakeholders’ benefits. Nevertheless, despite a few works on requirement conversion, it is not clear about the mapping mechanism under the target of value co-creation. Aiming to fill this gap, an integrated SPSS conceptual design method is proposed to solve the cross-domain mapping problem. It decomposes and reorganizes SPSS's function requirements with requirement development laws in TRIZ and divides the physical domain into product-related domain and service-related domain. Design parameters would be selected and evaluated by domain experts based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation from different dimensions, which could represent the benefit of multi-stakeholders. Next, a binary integer programming (BIP) model with restrictions from different stakeholders would be constructed, which could be regarded as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve the BIP model, the genetic algorithm is used and the optimal design parameters combination could be generated as the output of this process. Finally, a case study is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the integrated approach for cross-domain mapping in SPSS conceptual design.}

abstract = {Alternative selection in new product development (NPD) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. It usually starts with incomplete, imprecise or even partially missing information. Currently, most existing methods in dealing with this problem cannot work well if required information is incomplete or missing. It is acknowledged that stochastic multi-objective acceptability analysis (SMAA) can be applied to address MCDM problem with incomplete preference information and uncertain criteria measurements. In SMAA, alternatives are evaluated based on SMAA measurements (acceptability index, central weight vector and confidence factor). The discriminability of SMAA for the optimum alternative heavily depends on differences of SMAA measurements among different alternatives. Usually, a large number of alternatives and high level of uncertainty are involved in alternative selection in NPD. In this situation, the differences among SMAA measurements are not obvious, and therefore SMAA cannot deal with such problem very well. To this end, this paper proposes an improved SMAA method called Iterative-SMAA (I-SMAA) for alternative selection in NPD. In the I-SMAA, an iterative multi-step decision-making process is suggested to improve differences of SMAA measurements among different alternatives, and thus assist decision makers (DMs) to positively discern from the most preferred alternative. To enhance the decision-making efficiency, sensitive criteria are acquired in each iteration by ranking sensitivity analysis. DMs are guided to provide partial preference information and give more accurate criteria measurements for sensitive criteria rather than all criteria. Eventually, to verify the proposed method, a numerical example of the existing literature is solved with the method, and the results are compared. And then, a practical example of a preparation equipment for coal samples is further employed to verify the practicability of the proposed I-SMAA.}

abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world. During the Covid-19 pandemic, which is tried to be prevented by all countries of the world, regulations have been made to reduce the effect of the virus in sectors such as banking, tourism, and especially transportation. Social isolation is one of the most critical factors for people who have or are at risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Many countries have developed different solutions to ensure social isolation. By applying lockdown for specific periods, preventing the movement of people will reduce the rate of transmission. However, some private and public institutions that have to serve during the lockdown period should be carefully determined. In this study, we aim to determine the petrol stations to serve during the COVID-19 lockdown, and this problem is handled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. We extend the spherical fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija IKompromisno Resenje (SF-VIKOR) method with the spherical fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP). To show its applicability in complex decision-making problems, Istanbul is selected to perform a case study; thirteen petrol stations are evaluated as potential serving petrol station alternatives during the lockdown. Then, the novel SF-AHP integrated SF-VIKOR methodology is structured; the problem is solved with this methodology, and the best alternative is determined to serve in lockdown. Accessibility of the petrol station and Measures taken by station managers are determined to be essential for the effectiveness of the lockdown process. The neighborhood population and the station's proximity to hospitals are also critical inner factors to fight the pandemic. To test the methodology, Spherical Fuzzy the Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment (SF-WASPAS) is utilized. Public or private organizations can use the proposed methodology to improve their strategies and operations to prevent the spreading of COVID-19.}

abstract = {Tool monitoring and machine diagnosis in real machining have been crucial to the realization of fully automated machining. Also, the on-line detection technique of the tool breakage in machining should be supported. The effect of tool breakage is usually revealed from an abrupt change in the processed measurements, which is in excess of a threshold value. Although these techniques are generally effective for a specific cutting condition, they are often not sufficiently reliable for use in production due to the inability of single measurement to reflect tool breakage under various cutting conditions. In order to enhance the reliability of tool breakage signatures obtained from a single sensor, an integrated approach based on measurements from several sensors has been put forward. In this study, the tool breakage detection method using multi-sensors is proposed and the sensor fusion algorithm is developed to integrate and make decisions from data measured through the multisensors. Also, the performances of this scheme are compared and evaluated with real cutting process.}

EVASYO describes the systems by components (resources, output, input) and activities. Generally the identification of the components and activities of a given systems is very difficult and takes a long time since a manufacturing system is complex and since the number of activities and components is very high. EVASYO introduces some reference activities and reference components to accelerate this step. Furthermore, the quality of results is improved since the method is based on an exhaustive know of resources and activities. We will illustrate the advantages of this methods by the presentation of two real studies in small firms. In the first study, we have used the classical ABC/ABM method.

Since it largely defines the ability to recirculate and last longer through the reuse, remanufacture, refurbishment, or recycling of a product from its material processability and durability properties. However, existing approaches to selecting materials are not formally linked to the Circular Economy (CE) concept and do not contemplate recirculation and longevity attributes during the selection process. To contribute to that research direction, this article presents a selection material approach denominated Extended Material Circularity (EMC) which considers the ability to close and extend the loop of materials and the cumulated carbon footprint associated with multiple lifecycles. The EMC aims to provide a robust methodological approach to facilitate material selection when circularity is considered an essential requirement. The implementation of the EMC approach is demonstrated through two case studies considering both materials with dissimilar nature and materials within the same family.}

abstract = {Most of the cancer patients cannot get the usual treatment in the advanced stage of the disease. In particular, for breast cancer, it is to use a special kind of radiation that targets the tumor while the patient holds their breath. This is called surface-guided (SG) breast radiotherapy (RT) with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH). This treatment is very complicated and different from the normal way of treating breast cancer. It can also have many errors and problems that are not well-studied or understood. To prevent these problems, we need to use a method called failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). This method helps us find and rank the possible risks and how to avoid them. In keeping with this aim, this paper studies consensus-reaching process-based group decision-making (GDM) with completely unknown risk factors' weights and the gained-lost dominance score (GLDS)-based ranking process. We cannot avoid the uncertainty related to relativity information in medical science. Therefore, in this study, we offer the experts to provide their opinions using the linguistic Z number (LZN) because LZN is designed to capture such types of information in medical science. For the consensus-reaching process (CRP), the relativity among experts is considered for consensus measurement, and the minimum adjustment sum with group consensus opinion-based feedback is offered. For unknown weight of risk factors, we don't know how much each risk factor weighs. So, we use a method that combines two ways of calculating weights. One way is a subjective weight computation process, and the other way is based on the data using entropy and division. Finally, we applied our proposed CRP-based GDM approach for ranking the identified FMs related to the SG DIBH RT process. We conduct sensitive, comparative, and statistical assessments to ensure our method is reasonable and practical.}

Being a complex process, the supplier selection plays an important role in upgrading the supply chain. The purpose of this research is to present an integrated approach based on fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for sustainable supplier selection considering seasonal quantity discounts and supplier risk for a radiator manufacturing company. Therefore, as the aim implies, this study addresses how organizations develop a sustainable supplier selection framework by integrating linear programming and decision-making in presence of seasonal discounts. To this end, fuzzy BWM and FMEA were employed to calculate weighting factors for different selection criteria and evaluate the supplier risk, respectively. Then, suppliers were ranked using the so-called technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Finally, the discount type was examined by the LP-metric method. Results of the fuzzy BWM showed that the customer satisfaction was the criterion of highest priority, followed by long-term relationship, and then pollution control, among the total of 13 criteria considered in this work. Outputs of the TOPSIS referred to the supplier 3 as the top-ranked supplier, followed by supplier 6 and then supplier 1.}

Current research has mostly focused on the role of high temperatures (heat shocks) in PY alleviation, while post-fire environmental conditions are less understood. Here, we examined the role of post-fire temperature fluctuation on seed germination and viability of Cerrado legume shrubs. Specifically, we investigated (1) whether PY is broken by temperature fluctuation; (2) whether seed viability is affected by temperature fluctuations; and (3) micromorphological changes in the seed coat following exposure to temperature fluctuation. Seeds of nine legume species were collected in frequently burned Cerrado savannas. We simulated post-fire temperature fluctuation in germination chambers, with daily temperature fluctuation ranging from 18 to 55 °C for 90 days; controls consisted of untreated seeds (room temperature). We conducted germination trials with unblocked and blocked hilar region of seeds. In addition, seed samples were fixed and subjected to micromorphological analysis. Instead of dormancy break, three species showed decreased seed germination for both unblocked and blocked hilar regions, while other two species showed decreased germination in blocked seeds only. Nevertheless, random cracks formed across the seed coat were found in control and treated seeds, which displayed a proportion of nondormant seeds. Within nondormant seeds, both hilar and extra-hilar regions (such as the pleurogram) may take part on water uptake. Despite the lack of dormancy break, most Cerrado legume seeds persisted viable after post-fire temperature fluctuation, thus avoiding establishment under hazardous conditions. Seed tolerance to heat shocks and post-fire temperature fluctuation likely drives regeneration from seed in burned Cerrado areas.}

The response in the last phase is considered using either small deflection or large deflection theory, based on the extent of panel deformation. The analysis is based on an energy balance and assumed displacement fields.

abstract = {At present, the enormous environmental pressure caused by the manufacturing industry has promoted the development of the recycling industry. The recycling industry is pivotal for sustainable utilization of regional resources, pollution reduction and environmental protection. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), as a comprehensive analytical tool, plays an important role in the analysis of the cyclical industry from different levels, including regional level, industry level, enterprise level and product/service levels. The product service system, a new production system with high integration and overall optimization of products and services, is conducive to obtaining complete product/service information and management. The LCA based product service systems in the field of circular economy is not only crucial in the life cycle management of the product/service for the enterprise, but also contributes to the comprehensive assessment of the environmental benefits of the recycling enterprise. This paper summarizes and systematic reviews the applications of the LCA and PSS (Product Service System) integration in circular economy from a micro perspective. Based on that, the study identifies the challenges for current researches and propose future research directions to promote the development of LCA in circular economy from the perspective of enterprises.}

This study presents a framework for supplier selection based on product-related and organization-related characteristics of the suppliers to be more competitive in the market and flexible to overcome probable changes in demands, supplies etc. Product-related and organization-related characteristics are those which are named in this study as lean and agile criteria respectively. Comprehensively digging up the literature, we extract the best criteria representing both leanness and agility of an organization. The aim of this paper is to select an appropriate supplier portfolio based on two aforementioned concepts. Supplier selection problem is solved using a combination of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. Due to the interaction between the criteria, analytical network process (ANP) is applied for determining the weight of each criterion for each alternative (supplier), and then data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to rank them. The reason that DEA is used in this study is that when the number of suppliers increases, ANP approach tends to work inefficiently. Moreover, for determining the accurate interdependencies between the proposed criteria, fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is applied. The framework is applied on a real case to demonstrate its applicability and feasibility.}

The adapted Balanced Scorecard translates design objectives into actionable goals and measures, which make it easier for designers to ensure efficient and effective designs. The proposed Balanced Scorecard approach was considered in a focus group meeting as being capable of facilitating communication between the clients and design professionals, and serving the purpose of optimising various design objectives.}

In this context, the prescription of assistive technology has been fundamental in promoting an individual's independence, social inclusion, and well-being. However, high abandonment rates of these devices have been reported and are commonly associated with the non-correspondence to personal needs. Designing customized and personalized products, especially for multidisciplinary applications, requires levels of systematization and user participation that are not well addressed by traditional methods. This paper introduces customization-based guidelines for requirements elicitation integrated with the House of Quality matrix and assistive technology assessment protocols. The proposition was based on clinical evidence, research experiences, a literature review, and a theoretical model. A shower chair case study was conducted with twelve users to demonstrate the approach's potential during the task planning and clarification stage. The strategy allowed the systematic identification of the central sources of dissatisfaction and the definition and prioritizing of user requirements in a multidisciplinary domain. The procedure led to analyzing demands that had not been initially conceived by the engineering team while also providing communication facilitators between the different knowledge domains and incorporating participatory design elements into the early stages.}

These criteria have to be analyzed along with constraints such as capacity commitment by the suppliers and the manufacturers for the production of a particular product. In this paper, estimated demand from various retail units, capacity commitment by suppliers, assemblers and third party warehouses have been considered as constraints in order to develop a two-objective decision-making model for the choice of suppliers and warehouses for a SCN design. The SCN is considered for the production of one product through an assembly of four modules supplied by different suppliers. It is shown that compared to the optimal solutions generated by considering only one objective, the choice of suppliers and warehouses in the network differ when two objectives are considered simultaneously. A few scenarios are developed to show the effect on the network solution due to changes in DMs’ preferences on various objectives. This way, decision-making becomes interactive. It is expected that the concept can be used by the researchers and the DMs in meeting their supply chain design objectives.}

However, the previous impact localization did not show the methodology to choose the location with the lowest error among candidate impact points, estimated from sensors. We propose an error-outlier-based algorithm with Pugh’s concept selection that can choose the impact point with the lowest error among several candidate impact points. The proposed impact localization algorithm was implemented for 30 arbitrary points on a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composite plate with two bonded FBG sensors. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could efficiently localize all impact points. Additionally, it could successfully choose the impact point with lower error among two candidate impact points estimated from the two sensors. The accuracy of selection was 93.33% and the totally estimated averaged-error for the selected sensors by Pugh’s concept selection for all tests was 6.24 mm. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed impact localization algorithm is effective in localizing the impact points with the lowest errors when multiplexed sensors are used, regardless of the type of sensor. This technique will contribute to reducing measurement errors when localizing impact points on composite structures.}

abstract = {Oriental lacquer, a milk-white sap collected from lacquer trees, can be cured automatically to bright and dense films in the presence of air, thus is worthy of being regarded as a type of natural green coating, as it does not emit any volatile organic compounds. It has been used in Asia for more than 8000 years attributing to its excellent characteristics. However, during harvesting and storage process, the lacquer sap surface can automatically polymerize into lacquer blocks under the catalysis of laccase present in the sap, wasting a significant amount of resources. It is an arduous task how to slow down the curing of oriental lacquer in storage without affecting the normal curing process in operation. Herein, the curing of oriental lacquer was adjusted using Na2CO3 and NaCl as additives. The results indicated that the addition of Na2CO3 quenched the semiquinone radical during the polymerization of urushiol, the main component of oriental lacquer, without affecting the laccase activity. Under the appropriate condition (25 °C and 80% relative humidity), the touch-free dryness time of the oriental lacquer mixed with Na2CO3 increased from 3 h to 15 days. Moreover, the addition of same amount of Na2CO3 and NaCl to oriental lacquer improved the curing time to 6 h, which was similar to that of pristine lacquer without the addition of any salts. The polymerization rate of the lacquer sap returned to the normal again, that may be due to the blocking of the reaction between urushiol and CO32‐ after the introduction of NaCl. Thereby, this study provided a novel and green method for oriental lacquer to achieve storage for a long time and relatively normal curing during application. This provides a guarantee for the wide use of oriental lacquer as a green natural coating.}

To meet the organization's requirements, some studies have proposed the use of multi-objective combinatorial optimization techniques. However, such formulations are notoriously difficult and complex to solve in reasonable computational time. In contrast to previous works, the present study proposes a novel integrated methodology to formulate and solve the Lean Six Sigma project portfolio as a 0–1 Bi-objective Quadratic Programming Problem. The model considers interdependent project effects (quadratic objectives) and is subject to resource limitations and constraints regarding mutually exclusive projects and mandatory projects. The approach permits tackling the problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programming Problem and thus to use the branch-and-bound algorithms implemented by the standard optimization solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. Numerical examples are provided to verify the efficiency and added value of the methodology.}

The study assessed the X’s selected (mechanical, thermal, physical, cost, dielectric, and environmental) by assigning weights to these factors, and identifying the optimal materials for each application. In the aeronautical context, PEI+GF30 was chosen as the best solution, attaining an overall effectiveness of 79 %, primarily due to its exceptional mechanical characteristics. The use of a thermoplastic can lead to lighter components while ensuring the same technical performance, enabling longer flight duration. Conversely, in the energy sector for power transformers, PSU obtained a 78 % score, largely attributable to its outstanding dielectric properties.

abstract = {Third-party logistics (3PL) has involved a significant response among researchers and practitioners in the recent decade. In the global competitive scenario, multinational companies (MNCs) not only improve quality of service and increase efficiency, but also decrease costs by means of 3PL. However, the assessment and selection of 3PL is a very critical decision, comprising intricacy due to the existence of various imprecisely based criteria. Also, uncertainty is an unavoidable part of the information in the decision-making process and its importance in the selection process is relatively high and needs to be carefully considered. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate data or information may occur among other various selection criteria, which can be termed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Interval rough numbers are very flexible to model this type of uncertainty occurring in MCDM problems. Thus this paper presents a new integrated interval rough number (IRN) approach based on the Best Worst Method (BWM) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method along Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) to evaluate 3PL providers. The hybrid IRN-BWM based methodology is used for computing the priority weights of criteria while IRN-WASPAS and IRN-MABAC are employed to achieve the final ranking of 3PL providers. A computational study is performed to illustrate the proposed approaches along with a sensitivity analysis on different sets of criteria weight coefficient values to validate the stability of the suggested methodology. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the obtained ranking results with their crisp and fuzzy counterparts is also conducted for checking the reliability of the proposed approach. The results display stability in ranking of alternative results and prove the feasibility of the proposed approach to handle MCDM problems with IRNs.}

Quality decisions are characterized by their ambiguity while their evaluation uses a multicriteria viewpoint. Fuzzy decision theory provides a conceptual framework to model decisions with these features. It enables the decision maker to add his/her own experience and any other type of information to that obtained from hard figures. This theory is applied to a set of quality decision alternatives which are evaluated using different criteria such as their impact on fixed costs, cost of quality, leadtirne and flexibility. The approach provided in this paper can be extended to other quality decisions.}

abstract = {Identification of the most appropriate non-traditional machining (NTM) process to generate a shape feature with the desired dimensional accuracy and surface finish in a work material for a given end application is a complex decision making task. It involves consideration and analysis of the machining capabilities and characteristics of each of the NTM processes. In order to evaluate the performance of the NTM processes with respect to their various characteristics, the opinions of the concerned process engineers are often sought which are usually expressed in terms of ambiguous/subjective data. Rough numbers are utilized to aggregate the judgments of those process engineers and express their observations while dealing with the impreciseness in the data. In this paper, an endeavour is put forward to solve two real time NTM process selection problems, i.e. generation of standard through holes in glass and deep through cavities in titanium while integrating rough numbers with multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method. The relative importance of various NTM process characteristics is determined using rough entropy technique. Rough set theory acts as an information aggregation procedure, while MABAC helps in ranking of the candidate NTM processes for a specified machining application. Ultrasonic machining emerges out as the best suited NTM process for generation of standard through holes in glass, while deep through cavities in titanium can be most efficiently generated using plasma arc machining process.}

The amount of energy consumption charged to the predominantly used multi-stage flash (MSF) desalter in this combined heat and power plant is a question of great concern in the Gulf area. The following are among the methods used to answer this questions (i) the available energy of the heat supplied to the desalter; (ii) work loss from the lower pressure stages of the steam turbine due to steam extracted to the desalter; (iii) energy charged if a separate boiler was used to supply the desalter with its required heat; and (iv) the excess energy supplied to the combined power desalting plant as compared to a single purpose power plant producing the same power output. There would be a different rating method of the power producing process associated with any of the above mentioned charging methods. In this paper, the MSF desalting method and its power consumption are outlined, together with the rating method of the power-desalting plants and the energy charged to the desalter methods. These rating methods are applied to real cases of dual purpose plants working in Kuwait.}

The theoretical framework, TQM practices, and the relationship between TQM implementation and customer satisfaction among cleaning companies in Finland were all examined. It was discovered that employee and communication management increases service quality and boosts organisational performance. The study also discovered that in cleaning organisations, organsational performance has a favourable and significant relationship with customer satisfaction, as well as a positive correlation between employee, communication management, and customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, according to the results of a correlation analysis based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, the only factor limiting the implementation of Total Quality Management in Finnish cleaning organisations was resistance to change, as there were no preliminary signs of multicollinearity based on the two variables of the correlation coefficient criteria (r 0.70). Furthermore, the study adopted hierarchical multiple regression analysis to analyse the relationship between Total Quality Management and Organisational Performance. The results revealed that the two entities have a substantial association, providing valuable insights into the cleaner aspects of the study, particularly when considering organisational performance and customer satisfaction in the Finnish cleaning industry.

Digital twin (DT), as a core part of cyber-physical system (CPS), can provide decision support to enhance engineering product lifecycle management workflows via remote monitoring and control, high-fidelity simulation, and solution generation functionalities. Although many studies have proven DT to be highly suited for industry needs, little has been reported on the product family design and optimization capabilities specifically with context awareness, which could be leaving many enterprises ambivalent on its adoption. To fill this gap, a reusable and transparent DT capable of situational recognition and self-correction is essentially required. This paper develops a generic DT architecture reference model to enable the context-aware product family design optimization process in a cost-effective manner. A case study featuring asset re-/configuration within a dynamic environment is further described to demonstrate its in-context decision-aiding capabilities. The authors hope this study can provide valuable insights to both academia and industry in improving their engineering product family management process.}

This paper presents a systematic prequalification procedure, based on Fuzzy Set Theory, whose main differences and advantages in comparison with other models are the use of an algorithm to handle the inconsistencies in the fuzzy preference relation when pair-wise comparison judgements are used and the use of linguistic assessment or exact assessment of performance of the contractors on qualitative or quantitative criterion, respectively.

The importance of these activities is increasing, especially in the last decade, which has witnessed an enormous expansion of geospatial data use in general and especially among mass users. Although geospatial data producers are striving to define and present data-quality standards to users and users increasingly need to assess the fitness for use of the data, the success of these activities is still far from what is expected or required. As a consequence, neglect or misunderstanding of data quality among users results in misuse or risks. This paper presents an aid in spatio-temporal quality evaluation through the use of spatio-temporal evaluation matrices (STEM) and the index of spatio-temporal anticipations (INSTANT) matrices. With the help of these two simple tools, geospatial data producers can systematically categorize and visualize the granularity of their spatio-temporal data, and users can present their requirements in the same way using business intelligence principles and a Web 2.0 approach. The basic principles and some examples are presented in the paper, and potential further applied research activities are briefly described.}

abstract = {Energy consumption and costs are among the main parameters affecting the choice of desalting systems and the final unit cost of the desalted water. In addition to the performance of the plant, the cost of the consumed energy depends on the quality of energy, i.e., either mechanical or thermal and, if thermal, at what temperature. The cost also depends on the way this energy is applied (e.g., thermal energy can be directly applied from a boiler or from cogeneration steam turbines or from heat recovery steam generators of gas turbines). The use of the concept of availability (exergy) to bring different kinds of energy to a common basis of comparison is presented here. The way energy applied was considered in comparing the energy consumption of different desalting systems, namely, multi-stage flash (MSF), conventional multi-effect boiling (MEB), thermovapor compression (TVC), mechanical vapor compression (MVC), and reverse osmosis (RO) desalting systems. A rational basis for costing thermal and electrical energy was used to compare the energy costs of different types of desalting systems.}

Existing customer-involved design concept evaluation (CDCE) methods based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models collect customer preferences for certain pre-determined criteria as the one kind of evaluation factor without further exploring these subjective data, and sort the alternatives according to their deviations to positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS). The elements of PIS and NIS are defined only limited to considering the benefit-like or cost-like characteristics of criteria without considering the impacts of customer preferences. To make better use of the customer preferences in CDCE, we propose a new multi-criteria CDCE method which not only captures the customer-related weights and importance ratings of criteria from customer preferences, but also more importantly, redefines PIS and NIS by comprehensive considering the characteristics of criteria and their importance ratings. Rough distances between alternatives and redefined ideal solutions are calculated to obtain the preferred degrees of alternatives for priority ranking, so the proposed method is named as evaluation based on rough distance to redefined ideal solution (RD-RIS). With the help of new combined ideal solution definition strategy adopted in RD-RIS, the best design concept recommended by RD-RIS is favored by customers as well as satisfies the constraints of evaluation criteria. Besides theoretical research, a practical example is introduced to illustrate the process of RD-RIS, and the empirical comparisons between RD-RIS and other classical MCDM methods are carried out to validate the superiority of RD-RIS. Experimental results show that RD-RIS is a feasible CDCE method which can give more reliable and reasonable evaluation results based on different customer preference values.}

It is widely recognised as an environmentally preferable end-of-life strategy for many products, as it is a process that saves materials from landfill and retains more intrinsic energy than similar end-of-life strategies such as recycling or repair. The concept of ‘design for remanufacture’ (DfRem) originates from the understanding that decisions made during the design process may have a considerable effect upon the efficiency and effectiveness of the remanufacturing process. Much of the DfRem literature to date has focused upon the identification of technical DfRem factors (such as material choice or fastening methods), and the subsequent development of design methods and tools. However, the literature has overlooked how DfRem practices may be integrated into a company design process, and has not considered the operational factors that may influence DfRem integration decision-making and practice. This paper presents the findings from industrial case study research with three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) from the UK mechanical industry sector. The research has identified significant external and internal operational factors that influence DfRem integration, including management commitment, OEM-remanufacturer relationships and designer motivation. This paper also presents a ‘DfRem integration network model’ which maps the identified relationships between the various operational factors, providing practitioners with an enhanced understanding of DfRem and a portfolio of options when seeking to integrate DfRem into the design process.}

The model suggests that resource management regimes change in four phases: (i) crisis caused by external factors, (ii) a search for alternative management solutions, (iii) creation of a new management regime, and (iv) bureaucratic implementation of the new arrangements. The history of human use and management of the tropical forests of this region is described and applied to this model. The ensuing analysis demonstrates that: (i) resource management tends to be characterized by a series of distinct eras; (ii) changes to management regimes are precipitated by crisis; and (iii) change is externally generated. The paper concludes by arguing that this theoretical perspective on institutional change in resource management systems has wider utility.}

Thus, QM is expected to improve customers’ satisfaction and, at the same time, reduce non-quality costs. When these practices are implemented, some organizations obtain positive results, i.e. they improve their competitiveness and productivity, increasing their survival probability and superiority. However, many organizations can not reach their goals. In this context, this paper is the result of a research about the main barriers that cause the failure of the implementation of QM practices. The method of qualitative research was used in two case studies developed in Brazilian manufacturing companies followed by a semi-structured interview with an Operational Management specialist. The main barriers found were lack of support of the company leadership, lack of communication and also plenty of bureaucracy during the implementation. It can be concluded that the main barriers are more related to the elements that support the implementation process, than the inherent characteristics of each QM practice.}

abstract = {Health 4.0 actively focuses on cold supply chains (CSCs) due to digital transformation and technological advancements in refrigeration. With the ill effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, countries globally seek sustainable supply chain management. In this context, integrating sustainability with CSCs becomes crucial. Health sectors actively consider CSC for their activities. In this context, to gain potential suppliers for healthcare management, the present work focuses on grading suppliers from the CSC with sustainability factors. Previous related studies on sustainable cold chain supplier selection (CSSS) (i) have not modeled uncertainty effectively, and (ii) have yet to use any approach under fuzzy Z-numbers information. Therefore, this paper developed an integrated framework, including the Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (LMAW) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods based on extended fuzzy Z-numbers. The practicality of the framework is exemplified via a case example within the Indian health sector, and results indicate that job creation, value price, and productivity via renewable resources are the most critical factors. Moreover, regarding the findings, the economic dimension is the foremost pillar for effective selection. Sensitivity and comparison analyses are performed to understand the efficacy of the integrated framework as well. The proposed framework could contribute to the relevant literature due to its capacity to cope with complex decision-making problems and find many application areas in engineering.}

The patent roadmap is used to analyze patent competition and develop a patent strategy. In the patent roadmap, patent analysis, patent maps and a generic technology roadmap are used. By using these three methods in combination, two concepts, patent information and patent strategies, are linked. Further, the patent roadmap provides theoretical and informational support for companies, allowing them to learn about the current patent competition situation, and perform corresponding patent layout planning. Compared to previous research on technology and patent roadmaps, this study illustrates the patent competition situation in some industries, and provides a new method for patent strategy planning and its applications. In a case study, this paper presents the patent roadmap of the high-speed railway track (HSRT) industry, specifying the whole roadmapping process and an application in patent planning.

PCI is an expensive procedure in our population and it implies a huge cost for the institutions and National Health Service.
Aim of the study
The main objective was to evaluate the technical and biological success of two stents designed in Mexico.
Methods
Ten York pigs, 4–6 months of age, underwent implantation of the bare metal INC-01 (10 stents) and INC-02 (6 stents) coronary stent in addition to a conventional commercial stent (10 stents). Technical success was evaluated immediately with angiography and Intravascular Ultrasound IVUS, continued by a mean follow-up of 4 month and a final angiographic, IVUS and histological evaluation.
Results
Initial technical success, angiography and IVUS between the three stents were not significant. One stent presented restenosis in follow-up (commercial stent), but all other stents presented excellent clinical outcome, satisfactory angiographic and IVUS results. Inflammation, proliferation and endothelialization between the stents had no major differences in histological analysis in a mean of 4 months follow-up.
Conclusions
In this pig model, the INC 01 and INC 02 stents showed the same delivering technical success, angiographic and IVUS features, biological and histological response compared to commercial last generation stents.}

Nowadays, construction projects are facing various problems where delays are considered major one of them, particularly in Egypt. Analyzing construction delay causes while attempting to mitigate their impact is a matter of crucial importance. That’s why a program was developed to help the user assess the delay causes’ impact with respect to the project’s concerned activities. Besides, it was designed to identify the potential mitigation measures according to the delay cause type. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) was the platform used to carry out such analysis. Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the delay causes’ effect on the project’s duration and cost. This was achieved by analyzing the concerned activities’ affected duration and cost, according to the selected delay cause and its associated mitigation measures, by means of a developed user plug-in. Then, duration/cost summary tables were presented for the user to highlight the main findings in terms of delay and saving impact. The attained results were considered important indicators to be referred to for similar cases throughout the project progress. Apart from being a helpful tool for assessing construction delay causes’ impact, this developed user plug-in could also serve in future research works associated to this subject.}

The design for remanufacturing (DfRem) is one favorable strategy that facilitates protecting the latent energy and power in salvaged products/components. This paper presents a mathematical model, which describes DfRem as an integral process in developing a new product under three different scenarios as: i) when only new components are used, ii) when a mix of old and new spare part is used, and iii) when only old components are considered. The paper defines a strategy in choosing the core acquisition mathematically that follows an exponential or delayed S-shaped distribution along with the cost model formulations. Using the non-linear optimization modeling, the proposed framework has been validated on the sales data related to products which belong to altered industries such as automobile, telecommunication, and electronics. Results have shown that a product developed using the combination of old and new components is better as compared to using all new components or all old components. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to examine the impact of the various parameters on the decision variables. The significance of this study is to provide a solution of procuring components in different manners and producing remanufacturable products using either new or used (old) components to the manufacturers.}

The complexity of RL elements for EOL electronic products is a challenge in this field. Recently, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have focused on RL activities. To this aim, third-party reverse logistics partners (3PRLPs) play an important role. This paper simultaneously draws attention to the selection of 3PRLPs and determine how orders are assigned to every 3PRLP using a new framework. There are two phases in this framework. The first phase includes an approach that integrates data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a differential evolution (DE) algorithm to increase the discriminatory power and distinguish the 3PRLPs based on their efficiencies. DEA is considered in this study because it is an effective method to determine the efficiency based on the simultaneous analysis of inputs and outputs. In Phase 2, those efficiency scores are utilized to allocate orders to 3PRLPs using a multi-objective model. Two solution approaches are employed for solving the proposed multi-objective model and to find Pareto-optimal solutions. The application of the models is shown in Canada’s cellphone industry. The results reveal that the efficiency of 3PRLPs may have an effect on both third-party reverse logistics partner selection and the orders allocated to them.}

Furthermore, dealing with images with both bright targets and dark targets, filter images for two kinds of targets separately is commonly for the image preprocessing. In this paper, a local segment contrast measure method is proposed to preprocess images uniform. Finally, the influence of certain vital parameters (e.g., the block size and the filter window size) on the detection and compression performance is discussed at length. Several guiding principles for the selection of those vital parameters are developed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework with an appropriate block size and filter window size provides a great balance between real-time performance and accuracy. The proposed local segment contrast measure method is efficient when applied to both bright and dark small targets.}

However, making such decisions is difficult because there are lots of quantitative and qualitative factors to be considered in evaluation process. This paper has two main contributions. Firstly, it combines two well-established managerial methodologies, balanced scorecard (BSC) and data envelopment analysis (DEA), and proposes a new approach for IT project selection. This approach uses BSC as a comprehensive framework for defining IT projects evaluation criteria and uses DEA as a nonparametric technique for ranking IT projects. Secondly, this paper introduces a new integrated DEA model which identifies most efficient IT project by considering cardinal and ordinal data. Applicability of proposed approach is illustrated by using real world data of Iran Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.}

DfRem targets at designing products that have multiple life cycles, thus significantly reducing raw material usage, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. In this paper, we develop a three-stage framework that consists of (1) systematic design space exploration and a multi-objective optimization formulation to minimize the likelihood of failure causes (such as fatigue and wear) and environmental footprint, (2) topology optimization to further reduce material usage without significantly affecting the load-carrying capability of the product, and (3) post-topology optimization design verification to ensure the proposed design satisfies all design constraints. The environmental impact can be assessed at varying comprehensiveness levels (e.g., design and manufacturing phase, use phase) and in terms of carbon or GHG emission, energy use, and waste generation. Because the novel design framework predominantly adjusted the geometry, we focused on mass-based change and energy savings due to sustained remanufacturability. The multi-objective optimization formulation in the first step results in a Pareto optimal set of possible design solutions that the designer can use for the second step. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a case study of an engine cylinder head subjected to thermo-mechanical loads, where we find that about 5% of the product mass can be conserved with only about a 3% increase in surface area that has a fatigue life less than 10,000 cycles.}

Albeit the model in question was thorough enough to be applied in various cases, its embedded abstract principles hamper straightforward applications and the required resources, tools, and techniques are not clarified. In AD terms, it lacks PVs created by mapping the design parameters (DPs) to the process domain to clarify the means that produce the specified DPs. Owing to the difficulties involved in the definition of PVs for manufacturing systems, there is few works in this area. This paper is an attempt to introduce PVs in production system design. When we are developing a product (i.e. a part), we can simply interpret the set of PVs as the process design. In the case of a production system we interpret PVs as the tools, methods, and resources, required for implementing a lean production system. In this paper, according to AD methodology, we have developed a hierarchical structure to model the design process of a lean production system, composed of FRs, DPs, and PVs. Serving as an efficient guideline for the design process and clarifying the required tools, methods, and resources, this structure is general enough to be applied for different cases.}

Prediction of demand is a complex problem as it highly depends on some parameters such as product cost. In this research, a three-stage framework is proposed to tackle the hurdles of SSOA planning problem. In the first stage, a hybrid deep learning technique based on multistep Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is developed to determine the future product demands. The efficiency of the developed model is evaluated using two standard error measuring techniques. Then, the results are compared with two other forecasting models to have accurate forecast. One of them is Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the other one is a deep learning model named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In the second stage, a fuzzy supplier evaluation model based on Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) model is developed to consider qualitative criteria. The third stage fetches the results from the forecasting model in Stage 1, and the results of the fuzzy model in the second stage. A unique multi-objective programming model is developed to select the best suppliers and to determine the allocated orders to them. To derive the efficient solutions, the weighted-sum method is used. The application of the proposed framework is discussed using a real dataset from the Canadian Juice industries. The results of the performance comparison among the considered forecasting models show that the developed LSTM model can lead to less forecasting errors compared to the SARIMA and MLP models.}

To address this problem, this study offers a novel Reverse Design for Remanufacture (RDfRem) method to offer redesign strategy for improving the remanufacturability of product based on failure feedback and polychromatic sets. An integrated model, namely, Reverse DfRem Polychromatic Model (RDPM), was developed to describe the relationship among the product’s components, failure modes, scrap modes, economic and obsolescence criteria, and EOL product recovery options based on the theory of polychromatic sets. Thus, the DfRem of product could be formally described mathematically and manipulated by using the computer system. Furthermore, a redesign proposal polychromatic reasoning method was designed to identify the proposed architecture of product. Then redesign proposals were provided to improve the remanufacturability of product. Finally, a simple example was considered to illustrate the entire framework of the proposed method and the case study of an engine validated the feasibility of the method proposed in this study.}

abstract = {One of the most crucial decisions in service development is concept selection. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to evaluation of new service concepts (NSCs). This study proposes an analytic network process (ANP) approach to evaluation of NSCs. ANP is a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method that can accommodate interdependency among decision attributes. The proposed approach measures feasibility of NSCs in terms of strategy, technology, market, implementation, and operation. The derived feasibility values of NSC alternatives are then employed to construct the NSC portfolio matrix, together with customers’ preference. The NSC portfolio matrix is expected to aid decision making on concept selection and provide managerial implications for service development. A case of the mobile information and entertainment service is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.}

abstract = {With global market competition, product family design and a platform-based strategy have received a lot of attention for providing sufficient variety of products in an economical way. Most previous research for the product family design has focused on its economic benefits by sharing common platform for manufacturing phase. Since awareness of environmental concerns is growing at an ever-increasing rate, environmental regulations are becoming more stringent, which in turn pushes designers to consider extra features in product family design, for example, sustainability. In order to consider the sustainability in the product family design, the platform strategy for manufacturing should be redesigned and reinterpreted from the viewpoint of the sustainability because the platform is shared with all products in the product family. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to identify a sustainable platform for a product family. The sustainable platform has three characteristics: high sustainability, low risk to product redesign, and high commonality. For degree of sustainability, the values of sustainability indicators such as environmental, economic, and social indicators are aggregated to a single sustainability value of a product using a multi-attribute decision making approach. In order to analyze the risk to product redesign, a model of the risk is introduced to predict the unexpected changes of components or sub-systems, as well as its change propagations based on Bayesian network. As main characteristic of current platform design is commonality, the degree of the commonality is also analyzed along the product family. A fuzzy inference system is utilized to assess and select the sustainable platform based on the three characteristics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a case study is carried out with a family of coffee makers. Consequently, the proposed methodology contributes to identifying a product platform from the viewpoint of sustainability by linking the sustainability to product design.}

abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation affects 4% to 8% of individuals over 60 years of age based on studies of predominantly white populations, whether this is true among nonwhite individuals is not clear. This study was undertaken to define racial/ethnic differences in atrial fibrillation prevalence among a large community cohort.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. In 2008, there were 430 317 members aged 60 years or older in a large California health maintenance organization. By searching International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and electronic electrocardiographic archives, we identified all members in this age group with primary, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Race/ethnicity data were assigned using health plan enrollment, service utilization, Asian/Hispanic surname and geocoding methods, and was available for 80.5% of members (79.8% of non-atrial fibrillation and 92% of atrial fibrillation), 99% of which were white, black, Asian, or Hispanic. We assessed the age- and gender-specific atrial fibrillation prevalence rates for each racial/ethnic group. The effect of race/ethnicity on atrial fibrillation was analyzed with logistic regression methods adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
The overall atrial fibrillation prevalence was 5.3%. Among members with assigned race/ethnicity data, the prevalence among whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics was 8.0%, 3.8%, 3.9%, and 3.6%, respectively. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of atrial fibrillation among blacks, Asians, and Hispanics with whites as referent were 0.49 (0.47-0.52), 0.68 (0.64-0.72), and 0.58 (0.55-0.61), respectively.
Conclusions
Atrial fibrillation is less prevalent in older non-white individuals than whites. White race/ethnicity is associated with significantly greater odds for atrial fibrillation compared to blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, after adjusting for comorbidities associated with the development of atrial fibrillation.}

Concentrations for PCB-congeners 101 and 153, which when combined account for approximately 16% of total PCB burden in Lake Ontario fish species, were analyzed with respect to trout age and weight. Age-class dependencies for diet composition and energy densities of prey and consumer were incorporated in the analysis. Parameters obtained from independent metabolic and fish growth studies were further refined, using recent data in the fields of pollutant kinetics, bioenergetics and freshwater fish production. Sensitivity analyses indicated a general robustness of the model, with metabolic and growth related parameters found to be most critical. The model was fitted to Lake Ontario water and fish pollutant concentrations data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach, and confirmed the significance of the acclaimed food-chain route of exposure.}

abstract = {Supplier selection and order allocation (SSOA) is an emerging and important issue in supply chain management. SSOA activities can be utilized to mitigate and manage carbon emissions for organizations. SSOA decisions that explicitly consider carbon neutrality or net-zero emissions within the sourcing process are lacking in the literature. This paper introduces a foundational multi-objective mathematical model to bridge this research gap. The model is empirically applied and evaluated using case study information from an energy trading platform that allows for the joint selection of a portfolio of suppliers. Various sourcing policies are evaluated using a reformulation of the foundational model. Parametric analyses provide additional theoretical and practical insights. Findings include the buyer only seeking fossil fuel purchases or virtually ignoring renewable energy usage—reaching net-zero through the purchase of carbon offsets and end-of-pipe carbon emissions sequestration. These and other findings provide theoretical and managerial insights. Additional opportunities for future investigation are relatively extensive for this socio-environmentally crucial issue. Future research guidance on carbon neutrality and net-zero implications for SSOA is provided in this paper.}
