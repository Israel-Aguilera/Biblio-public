abstract = {The use of the right type of Information Technology (IT) applications or manufacturing systems is expected to usher in a competitive advantage. Selection of the right type of IT application is, however, a challenging task. When a company, with a given dominant process structure, emphasizes two or more competitive priorities, such as quality, product flexibility, etc., an unaided manager faces a complex decision problem in choosing from alternative IT applications available in the areas of product design through distribution. In this paper, we present a Knowledge Based System (KBS) that would assist managers with the identification of IT applications that are consistent with both the competitive priorities and the process structure. Validation of the system illustrates that its performance is consistent with the human experts, and it has the potential to facilitate effective and swift decision-making in the selection of appropriate IT applications that best match an organization's manufacturing strategy.}

By engaging sustainable suppliers, an organization gets clean and green materials to ensure that their end-products are environmentally friendly. Sustainable supplier selection is a challenging task as it involves a complex decision making process involving different objectives and organization priorities. We propose a combined AHP-TOPSIS multiple criteria decision-making approach to solve this problem considering the uncertainty involved and to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative data. In this research, ethics is taken as the fourth dimension of sustainability along with Triple Bottom Line, considering that ethics plays a crucial role in purchasing activity and supplier selection. These four dimensions for sustainable supplier selection criteria have been divided into 16 sub-criteria to evaluate the suppliers. The model is demonstrated by its application to select a sustainable supplier in a real world electronics case company. The results indicate that economic factors still dominate during sustainable supplier selection. In selecting a sustainable supplier, it is found that prominence is given to human rights, safety systems and occupational health, pollution control and resource reduction and consumption, code of conduct, and transparency in suppliers' business and accounting criteria, which covers the other dimensions of sustainability. The application of the proposed model demonstrates the evaluation of tangible and intangible sustainability criteria in selecting a supplier. The result provides a ranking for the suppliers by showing their distances from the positive ideal solution of a sustainable supplier.}

When choosing a material for a component, one should start with the full menu of materials as an option. When selecting a material for an engineering component, there is usually more than one option. However, the final choice will be a balance between the materials based on the benefits and drawbacks they provide. This paper focuses on material selection for racing bicycle forks utilizing knowledge-based expert systems based on design requirements. Knowledge-based expert systems are computer methods replicating human problem-solving through artificial intelligence to arrive at the best decisive action. A database of 67 materials with its own set of attributes was created. The material index and shape factor were evaluated for all the materials in the database based on the critical selection factors of mass and section shape. Material selection is determined by considering the material index, shape factor, and coupling various design requirements by framing simple IF-THEN rules using the python interface and Jupyter Notebook. According to this method, the final suitable materials for selecting racing bicycle forks are Aluminium alloys and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). As the application demands lower weight by compromising on the cost, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) is the most preferred choice for material selection of racing bicycle forks.}

Four output mechanisms were identified during the analysis of 22 DfE tools. Further analysis of these mechanisms revealed that the output was focused in one of two ways. In the majority of tools, strategies are prioritised to initiate the output mechanisms, resulting in guidance that is strategy focused and of limited use to the designer. The alternative is to focus on the product under development to initiate the output mechanism. This has the potential to deliver output and guidance that is directly relevant to the product. This paper identifies and discusses the types of guidance provided by DfE tools. The performance of each tool at assisting the user towards a better understanding of environmental issues and improving their ability to generate viable solutions is fully discussed. In summary, this paper explains the background to the study, outlining the research method, and discusses the importance of the findings relative to the future design of DfE tools.}

Various types of data, methods and tools are needed to tackle formulated product design problems to achieve an optimal design. In this study, an integrated framework as well as the design steps are proposed for the design of all kinds of formulated products including liquids, solids, emulsions, etc. Strategies for the selection of different modelling methods such as rule-based methods, model-based methods, experiments and databases are also presented. A multi-layer knowledge library is proposed to store all the information needed in the design of formulated products.

It has become widely accepted that the future of manufacturing organizations will be information-oriented, knowledge-driven and much of the daily operations will be automated around a global information network that connects everyone together. Clearly, we need tools for information retrieval and knowledge organization in such an information environment. Integrating the hypermedia concept with the vision on the future of manufacturing, the paper also discusses the implications for manufacturing research. In Part I, we cover the general introduction to multimedia and hypermedia, and this is followed by a review on the state-of-the-art applications in manufacturing. In Part II, the potentials of hypermedia for manufacturing are identified, and the corresponding issues discussed. Finally, our proposed concept on the use of hypermedia for total quality management (TQM) is introduced.}

The ideas in the mind of the customer can be represented by higher level concepts. However, the actual shape, color, and cost embodied in the product can only be viewed as lower-level features. In this paper, a model of preference elicitation from customers is proposed to bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. First, the attributes of customer preferences are classified using preference taxonomies that we develop. These taxonomies are represented using unstructured documents that are directly collected from customer descriptions. Second, the documents or catalogs of design requirements, containing some textual descriptions and survey reports, are then normalized by using an ontology-based semantic representation. Some semantic rules are developed to describe the low-level features of customer preferences to build an ontological knowledge base. Third, customer preferences are mapped to domain ontologies for driving high-level concept generation. A customer preference modeling framework is developed to construct a vector space model to measure the similarity between two preference concept ontologies. Finally, an empirical study is implemented, and five different customer groups are surveyed about the cell phone preferences. The query results are analyzed to deeply understand the validity of concept generation from the customer preferences.}

This study evaluated the impact on the generated runoff due to: (1) decommissioning impervious surfaces, (2) transitioning land uses, and (3) incorporating bioretention cells at the neighborhood level in vacant lots. Hydrology-hydraulic modeling was used to evaluate the alternatives in two Midwestern shrinking cities, each operating on different stormwater systems (combined and separate) using city-provided and publicly available data. Historic precipitation; short-duration, high-intensity storms; and long-duration, low-intensity storms were assessed. Implementing the alternatives can reduce runoff between 10% and 98% depending upon the alternative and precipitation/storm.}

The well known ultrasonic signal processing technique referred to as split spectrum processing (SSP) has proven successful in suppressing material noise. However, the performance of conventional SSP algorithms depends strongly on the choice of frequency range utilized during expansion of the ultrasonic signal into a number of narrow-band split signals. If any of the split signals does not carry coherent target information there is a considerable risk of losing the target. This issue is discussed in detail in the paper and new robust SSP algorithms that reduce the above mentioned risk are proposed. A novel signal processing technique, referred to as cut spectrum processing (CSP), which eliminates the risk of losing the target echoes during expansion, is proposed. The CSP, which performs the expansion by excluding consecutive small parts of the signal spectrum, does not require a priori knowledge of the frequency range of the ultrasonic signal. Experimental results are presented, where SSP and CSP have been applied to ultrasonic signals originating from flaws in stainless steel.}

To accomplish this goal, a pair of non-linear programming problems is formulated based on Zadeh’s extension principle to compute α-level cuts of assessment criteria, which are frequently used to analyze capability of the variable measurement system in practice. The membership functions of these criteria are then constructed analytically by numerating different values of α. The capability assessment criteria discussed in this paper include repeatability, reproducibly, GRR% and Cgk. In the next step, a method for ranking fuzzy numbers is exploited to evaluate whether capability of the variable measurement system is satisfactory in fuzzy environment or not. Since fuzzy measures are gathered from the measurement system in a more realistic situation in which all variations and unexpected conditions are taken into account, it is shown using an empirical example that incorporating fuzziness into measurement data results in a more accurate capability analysis.}

abstract = {Today's business environment has created a high level of uncertainty and disturbed procedures in supply chains. Suppliers have been often identified as the main source of risks in creating the massive levels of disruptions in supply chains. That is why resilient supplier selection can greatly reduce purchase costs and time delays and can create stability in business practices, thereby increasing competitiveness and customer satisfaction. Pharmaceutical companies play an important key role in the health of society, and these companies are frequently exposed to this disorder. Hence, this paper tries to propose a new integrated approach based on traditional (delivery, quality, price, technology level) and resilient criteria for supplier selection in pharmaceutical companies using the Z-number data envelopment analysis (Z-DEA) model and artificial neural network (ANN). In the proposed approach, expert opinions have been provided based on Z-numbers due to the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in the evaluation process. This is the first study that evaluates the pharmaceutical industry based on traditional and resilience factors by presenting a methodological structure under the uncertainty environment. Here, a fuzzy mathematical model is used. A real case study is utilized to indicate the applicability of the proposed approach to resilient supplier selection in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, the suppliers are ranked and the best supplier is selected regarding the reliable level of α. To indicate the features and capabilities of the selected approach, the performance analysis is presented in three parts. First, the obtained results are compared with a fuzzy DEA (FDEA) method in the form of validation and verification. Second, a sensitivity analysis is executed to show the effects of different criteria on ranking results, and the price index is identified as the most important evaluation criteria. Third, a predictive model is presented based on ANN that is able to detect the efficiency or inefficiency of suppliers with an 83% accuracy.}

Up to the 45th order (4.44 nm) harmonic for H2 and the 53rd order (3.77 nm) harmonic in HeH+ are predicted. For H2, increase in laser intensity I does not change the structure of the high harmonic spectrum but increases the yield of each harmonic according to a fractional law of I1.5.

This turbulent environment requires new methods and techniques to bring successful new products to the marketplace. Much attention has focused on new development techniques, but little empirical research has been conducted to validate these techniques. In this study, the relationship between popular new development techniques and new product success is examined. Our findings suggest that only a subset of these popular techniques is significantly related with new product success in Spanish firms. The study also identifies the main contributors to new product development (NPD) effectiveness in Spanish firms.}

In particular, data concerning the performance and costs of activities and processes must be gathered in order to identify candidates for innovation. A critical point is finding a suitable presentation means for the gathered data in order to effectively support decision makers. This paper presents two case studies performed by applying a strategy, named Joint Evolution of business Processes and software Systems (JEPS), for innovating business processes and their supporting systems. JEPS integrates measurement, decision-making, and critiquing techniques for analyzing business processes, identifying activities and software systems to be innovated, and mapping critiques onto specific innovation actions. JEPS is supported by a software environment, named WebEv+, for managing the assessment and evaluation tasks, and the modeling and critiquing of the business processes. The paper discusses two case studies regarding two different organizations in the Local Government domain. The analysis of the organization highlighted improvement goals and technological enhancement needs, and permitted the identification of the business processes and software systems to be evolved.}

abstract = {Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a promising methodology for assisting conceptual product design. The efficiency of case retrieval determines the quality of design. In one-of-a-kind product design, customer activities are increasingly involved. Under the circumstances customized product design results in the increase of product variety, which produces a large case library. This brings difficulties in managing customized product families, and also results in issues in retrieving similar cases. In the scope of our knowledge, Only limited studies attempt to research case retrieval by addressing these OKP practice for its conceptual product design. Moreover, customer requirements (CRs) are not fully interpreted to guide this process at the preliminary design stage. To cope with these issues, approaches for elicitation of CRs and retrieving appropriate cases play essential roles in successful case retrieval for OKP. This paper proposes a modularized generic product model (MGPM) for managing OKP product families. This structured generic product model can represent a significant number of product/module/component variants in a single product model. Also, the weight distribution model (WDM) is developed for assign weighting factors of CRs to multi levels of product physical configuration. For similarity assessment, a weighted distance-based algorithm is developed to calculate the degree of similarity between the target case and the reference cases. A case study on the fruit chute system is carried out to prove the efficiency and industrial applicability of the proposed approach. The result shows that the propose approach is capable of effectively retrieving similar product/part variants according to specified CRs.}

One reason suggested for this is that the research is too generic, and that a product-specific approach based on firms’ unique “needs” for improved development is more appropriate. Using an approach recently developed via the uptake of concurrent engineering, the study concludes with a tentative framework for the application of the known success factors in new product development.}

In the competitive business environments, where customers are considered as a key success factor of the company, our research will help the company achieve the pro-activeness towards VOC and improve the quality of customer service based on scientific grounds. The proposed system is designed with three phases: the filtering phase to detect significant variations, the pattern detection phase to generate VOC occurrence patterns, and the VOC forecasting phase. In the filtering step, VOC is calculated and normalized to get rid of apparent exaggeration. In the pattern detection step, internal factors such as product or service qualities are used as sources for generating regular patterns and external factors like sales policy and customer inflow are used as sources for generation of irregular patterns. At the last phase, we forecast VOC based on the pre-defined pattern of VOC occurrence. We evaluate the proposed methodology by applying to the real VOC in a life insurance company.}

Previous literature has pointed out the importance of measuring customer’s attitude towards quality characteristics. In addition, the quality characteristics’ classification needs to be improved. Also, few studies have examined the impact of products’ different quality characteristics on sales rank. This paper measures customers’ satisfaction in online reviews based on a sentimental lexicon. The mobile phones’ quality characteristics are classified into five categories based on Kano model. The impact of these categories on sales performance is shown by using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model. Our sample is four mobile phone brands’ sales information and customer review data on Amazon websites. Our study extracts quality characteristics and transforms each review into a structured vector. LSTM’s weights are adopted to map quality characteristics into Kano model’s categories. The regression results show that the Excitement and Performance quality characteristics can significantly enhance product’s popularity. We also find that the Indifferent and Reverse quality characteristics can’t have a significant influence on these products. This study also highlights that the Must quality characteristics are essential but can’t continuously improve product’s sales performance. Our findings suggest that products’ quality characteristics may have a disparate influence on purchase decision.

Plants grown under low light and 25% greater total leaf area but 25% lower dry weight than plants grown under medium or high levels, regardless of cultivar. Time to flower in all cultivars was negatively correlated with quantum flux density, and specific leaf weight and leaf thickness were positively correlated to net photosynthetic rate. ‘Sprinter Scarlet’ and ‘Sooner Red’ had similar correlation coefficients (r) for most relationships, but r values for ‘Ringo’ were generally not as strong.

Issues analyzed are e.g. which types of aspects existing methods should consider, such as environmental issues and demands from stakeholders and customers. Another issue is what types of stakeholders are involved in the process. There is also an interest in finding out which of these methods are used in the industry. The goal is that the results will provide insight into how the requirements specification is used when developing an IPSO in theory, and in what way this insight will contribute to future studies on how companies currently derive and manage requirements when developing an IPSO. The literature review started out with the analysis of 201 papers, yielding 22 papers within the area of working with requirements for an IPSO. These papers were reviewed and summarized with the above issues and interests in mind. Findings are that when deriving requirements, existing IPSO design methods are lacking in regard to a holistic life cycle and system perspective of the offering. Few of the methods consider both requirements regarding the environmental impact of the offering and demands from all involved stakeholders, normally only the customer. Furthermore, few studies have ended with a clear work process regarding how to initially find the requirements to analyze them and later interpret them as actual metrics. There are also no signs that existing methodology is used in the industry's day-to-day work.}

This paper tries to bridge the gap between fixtures in traditional and non-conventional machining processes by developing a generic approach for designing a fixture for Wire-Cut EDM based on the methodologies followed for conventional processes. Different phases of the design process have been discussed in detail including the need to manufacture new or modify existing fixtures. Ashby charts method for material screening, and AHP and TOPSIS for material ranking have been included to help select the correct material. Additionally, due consideration is given to manufacturing and assembling the fixture body with the optimal processes to ensure cost savings. The approach can cut down on the lead time required from the conceptualization to the actual assembly of the fixture from a month to about a week depending upon machine availability on the shop-floor.}

In order to facilitate this process, this paper proposes a query-based ontology knowledge acquisition system which dynamically constructs query-based partial ontology to provide proficient answers for users’ queries. To construct the relationships and hierarchy of concepts in such an ontology, the formal concept analysis approach is adopted. After the ontology is built, the system can deduct the specific answer according to the relationships and hierarchy of ontology without asking users to read the whole document sets. We collected three kinds of sports news pages as source documents including those regarding NBA, CPBL and MLB to evaluate the precision of the system function in the experiment, which, as a result, reveals that the proposed approach indeed can work effectively.}

Failing to capture these voices will result in inefficient or even useless systems. The aim of this study is to develop a minimal data set for capturing users' voices on problems experienced by public health professionals in their daily work and opinions about how these problems can be solved. The issues of concern thus captured can be used both as the basis for formulating the requirements of ISs for public health professionals and to create an understanding of the use context.

Design concept evaluation is widely recognized as a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving various decision criteria and large amount of data which are usually imprecise and subjective. This paper proposes a new decision-making method to evaluate product design concepts based on the distance between interval vectors each alternative and positive and negative ideal reference vectors. Rank of design concepts is obtained by calculating interval-based relative closeness index for each alternative. In this method, to deal with uncertainty and vagueness of data in the primary phases of product design, performance of design concepts with respect to quantitative and qualitative criteria are concurrently evaluated using rough set and fuzzy set. The weights of criteria used in the evaluation are obtained using the extent analysis method on fuzzy AHP. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with a numerical example and the results are compared to TOPSIS method. In final, the conclusions of our method are represented and some future directions are proposed to improve the model.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose a new application methodology to evaluate the best inventory strategy through the use of an integrated approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simulation. Our specific aim is to applying an integrated multicriteria decision making model based on AHP and simulation to improve inventory management and reverse logistics management in order to reduce total supply chain costs. The application methodology, which is loosely based on Simulation approach, incorporates the AHP approach to delineate and rank the relative importance weight of expressed judgments to analyze global supply chain decisions. Different inventory control policies to be used in a supply chain with products return are presented. Definitely AHP and simulation model is used in order to investigate and compare the behavior of the inventory control policies in terms of total supply chain costs.}

abstract = {Design concept evaluation at the early stage of product design has been widely recognized as one of the most critical phases in new product development as it determines the direction of the downstream design activities. However, the information at this stage is mainly subjective and imprecise which only depends on experts’ judgments. How to handle the vagueness and subjectivity in design concept evaluation becomes a critical issue. This paper presents a systematic evaluation method by integrating rough number based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and rough number based compromise ranking method (also known as VIKOR) to evaluate design concepts under subjective environment. In this study, rough number is introduced to aggregate individual judgments and preferences and deal with the vagueness in decision-making. A novel AHP based on rough number is presented to determine the weight of each evaluation criterion. Then an improved rough number based VIKOR is proposed to evaluate the design concept alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to measure the impact of the decision makers’ risk to the final evaluation results. Finally, a practical example is put forward to validate the performance of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed decision-making method can effectively enhance the objectivity in design concept evaluation under subjective environment.}

Using case studies and an industry survey, the current process of briefing was assessed against pre-defined requirements for briefing within a CE context. It was established that current practices are not adequate, and the paper therefore concludes with recommendations on the development of a suitable methodology for briefing within a CE framework.}

Therefore, issues such as product reuse, remanufacturing and reprocessing must be considered during the product design stage. This paper proposes a diagnostic tool to evaluate product recyclability to be applied during the product design phase, acting as a supporting tool for designer decision-making. The potential for recyclability is connected to two factors: materials recycling and disassembly process. For disassembly process, the number, type and accessibility of fasteners were considered. For material recycling process, recycling infrastructure, material compatibility, presence of hazardous materials and existence of contaminants were considered. The proposed indexes are to be used with the product's Bill of Materials (BOM), during the conceptual and embodiment phases of product design. The tool was designed to provide the product's grade of recyclability a graphical diagnosis, aiding the designer in making better design choices. Thus, the designer can diagnose the most critical parts and change the product while still in the design phase, improving the product's recyclability at its end-of-life. A Design for the Environment (DFE) suggestion bank is also provided, to aid the designer in carrying out the improvement decisions. The proposed tool was used in a portable cassette and CD player, simulating its redesign, aiming to improve its end-of-life (EoL) performance. The results demonstrated the ease-of-use of the proposed tool, as well as the importance of having the DFE suggestion bank to give support for improvements.}

Traditional methods of understanding customer needs rely on costly marketing surveys and have difficulties accurately capturing new customer requirements in a fast-evolving market. Online reviews with positive and negative sentiments are commonly used as effective sources for mining customer requirements. Previous studies related to product design strategies often overlook neutral sentiment when analyzing online reviews for product design improvement. In this study, we propose a customer requirement identification framework that identifies the product attributes reflecting customer needs from online reviews, considering three types of sentiment polarities: positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. We categorize the identified customer needs into five product attribute categories that help form product design strategies using the Kano model. Evaluations using two review datasets for laptops and smartphones show that the consideration of neutral reviews caused the majority of the product attributes to be categorized differently by the proposed method. Furthermore, the product categorization obtained from our method achieved a better agreement with domain experts and consumers than that produced by the baseline Kano model, not considering neutral sentiment. We further established evidence that the product design informed by our product categorization results achieved better customer satisfaction than those generated from the baseline Kano model and the questionnaire-based Kano model.}

However, inconsistencies related to the understanding of the influence of various TNTs characteristics on Ti implant functions, and the multi-factorial inter-dependence of such characteristics, requires an in-depth Quality by Design (QbD) analysis towards optimizing TNTs-modified implants. To this end, an extensive systematic literature search was undertaken to identify the various TNTs characteristics that may influence implant performance. Subsequently, in order to facilitate a QbD analysis, an expert questionnaire survey was carried out to determine the perceived contribution of various TNTs characteristics on an implant's biological, physicochemical, and mechanical performance. To achieve this goal, the Quality Function Deployment method was employed using symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers to translate qualitative expert opinion into meaningful quantitative information. The results show that pore diameter, inter-nanotube distance and wall thickness are the TNTs characteristics with the most influential effects on the overall implant performance. This pioneering study evaluates perceived importance of various parameters contributing to TNTs functionality, and represents a step forward in the implementation of QbD strategies towards optimizing nano-engineered Ti implants.}

This paper attempts to improve the existing knowledge on agility, by presenting the results of an empirical research, whose aim is to investigate both the profile of agile companies and the enablers practically adopted by companies to achieve agility. The empirical investigation was performed on a sample of about 190 companies, about 65% of which were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Results of the analysis provide a detailed investigation of the agile paradigm; moreover, outcomes suggest new taxonomies for agile attributes and enablers, and in particular provide evidence of attributes and enablers that appear as most relevant in embracing an agile strategy.}

abstract = {A plethora of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods is available for selecting an optimal material for a design problem with quantitative measurements. However, little research has been conducted on material selection methods in an interval neutrosophic environment to address uncertainty. In this research paper, a unique framework is presented that combines Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Sets (IVNSs) with the entropy–MultiAtributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA) framework with the aim of simultaneously handling the objective criteria with crisp inputs and subjective criteria with ambiguous or uncertain information. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, a wing-spar of a Human-Powered Aircraft (HPA) is considered. At first, a panel of three subject experts makes judgments on the alternatives or criteria linguistically through IVNSs. Next, the skill level of each expert involved in the decision-making process is assessed using a novel weighting approach with linguistic information. After obtaining the objective criteria weights using the entropy weighting method, the performance of candidate materials for the HPA spar is evaluated using the MAIRCA method. The results indicate that S-glass70%-Epoxy Continuous Fibers, Ti-2Fe-3Al-10V and Al-7075 T6 are the top-ranked alternatives for spar application. The strong correlation of the proposed approach with other extant MCDM techniques demonstrates the reliability of the results obtained. In addition, the efficacy and practicality of the material selection tool is also validated with an outranking method in a simplified neutrosophic environment.}

There are a large number of established and newly developed materials, and their associated materials processes, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of many conflicting criteria. This has highlighted the importance of the developing field of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to the material selection process which is especially useful for high technology market where product differentiation and competitive advantage are often achievable with just small gains in material performance. It is clear that decision-making techniques that address target criteria as well as cost and benefit criteria can help engineering designers make better informed choices of materials. Despite the progress has been made in the ranking of materials for target-based criteria, there is no formalized technique for calculating the weighting dependency when target criteria must be taken into account in material selection problems that usually deals with databases. Therefore, to overcome this shortcoming, the strategy of using dependent weightings is extended in this research. Also, an alternative method is proposed to incorporate the correlation, objective, and subjective weightings effectively when there is uncertainty in the importance of three types of weights. This issue is very important for inexperienced designers. The updated procedure is validated through biomedical applications. The first example demonstrates the importance of dependency weighting in amalgam tooth filling material selection and the second one is a hip joint prosthesis material selection problem, which includes target criteria. Furthermore, a model of continuous improvement in product development is outlined, and it is highlighted that the material selection/development is a permanent and endless task for sustainable and profitable growth.}

We applied the Systematic Review Methodology proposed by Tranfield et al. (2003). This methodology allows for more comprehensive and profounder analysis along three stages: planning, conducting, and reporting. For this study, 403 papers were utilized, with their titles, abstracts and keywords separately studied at early stages of the review. These were collated from specific databases that included: ABI/INFORM Global, Taylor & Francis, Emerald, Sage, Inderscince, BSCO Business Source Premier, ScienceDirect and Scopus. The collected information was classified into four categories for more synthesis. The aim of this study is to establish the current position of global understanding of Lean implementation in SME's, including examining the main categories of Lean implementation in the context of SMEs. Next, an inclusive discussion of associated Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Lean implementation within SME's is established that can be used as guide for SME's owners and managers.

Initially devoted to chemists, chemicals substitution is nowadays a complex process involving corporate, business and engineering stakeholders across the chemical enterprise for orienting the search toward a sustainable solution. We formalize a decision making process framework dedicated to the sustainable chemical product design activity in an industrial context. The framework aims at improving the sharing of information and knowledge and at enabling a collaborative work across the chemical enterprise stakeholders at the strategic, tactical and operational levels. It is supported by information and communication technologies (ICT) and integrates a computer aided molecular design tool. During the initial intelligence phase, a systemic analysis of the needs and usages enables to define the product requirements. In the design phase, they are compiled with the help of a facilitator to generate the input file of a computer aided product design tool. This multiobjective tool is designed to find mixtures with molecular fragments issued from renewable raw materials, and is able to handle environment-health and safety related properties along with process physicochemical properties. The final choice phase discusses the solution relevancy and provides feedback, before launching the product manufacturing. The framework is illustrated by the search of a bio-sourced water–solvent mixture formulation for lithographic blanket wash used in printing industry. The sustainability of the solution is assessed by using the sustainability shades method.}

abstract = {High strength materials such as stainless steel, titanium, ceramics, and composites are widely used in the manufacturing of various components for aircraft, missile, turbine, automotive, tool and die-making, etc. These high-strength and difficult-to-machine materials are processed using a variety of non-conventional machining (NCM) processes to produce the desired forms with required dimensional accuracy and surface finish. The NCM processes are costly and consume a lot of electricity, thus, choosing the best NCM process is critical for cost-effective machining. The proper selection of the NCM processes is essential to the productivity and profitability of the company. In this research work, the NCM process selection problem is addressed using CRITIC (criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation) and CODAS (combinative distance-based assessment) multicriteria decision-making methods. The successive integration of CRITIC and CODAS makes the computational methodology simple yet effective for use in NCM process selection problems. A case study is conducted to assess the performance of proposed approach while selecting the best NCM process for machining titanium from the eight most often used NCM processes, namely, AJM (abrasive jet machining), USM (ultrasonic machining), CHM (chemical machining), EBM (electron beam machining), LBM (laser beam machining), ECM (electrochemical machining), EDM (electrodischarge machining), and PAM (plasma arc machining). Material removal rate, shape feature, work material type, tolerance and surface finish, power requirement, and cost are the criteria used to evaluate and pick the best NCM process. The criteria are weighted using the CRITIC method. Based on the criteria stated, PAM is proven to be the best possible NCM process for machining titanium, followed by EBM. The acquired results are compared to the results of previous studies and found to be in good accord.}

The construction of new wind farms and the installation of new wind turbines are important processes in order to provide a long-term energy production. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation model, which incorporates interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and fuzzy analytic network process (FANP), is constructed to select suitable turbines when developing a wind farm. A case study is carried out in Taiwan in evaluating the expected performance of several potential types of wind turbines, and experts in a wind farm are invited to contribute their expertise in determining the importance of the factors of the wind turbine evaluation and in rating the performance of the turbines with respect to each factor. The most suitable turbines for installation can finally be generated after the calculations. The results can be references for decision makers in selecting the most appropriate wind turbines.}

abstract = {Many researchers have performed impact localization using multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for a unique estimation of impact position. However, the previous impact localization did not show the methodology to choose the location with the lowest error among candidate impact points, estimated from sensors. We propose an error-outlier-based algorithm with Pugh’s concept selection that can choose the impact point with the lowest error among several candidate impact points. The proposed impact localization algorithm was implemented for 30 arbitrary points on a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composite plate with two bonded FBG sensors. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could efficiently localize all impact points. Additionally, it could successfully choose the impact point with lower error among two candidate impact points estimated from the two sensors. The accuracy of selection was 93.33% and the totally estimated averaged-error for the selected sensors by Pugh’s concept selection for all tests was 6.24 mm. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed impact localization algorithm is effective in localizing the impact points with the lowest errors when multiplexed sensors are used, regardless of the type of sensor. This technique will contribute to reducing measurement errors when localizing impact points on composite structures.}

The review resulted in 14 findings that were organised according to four dimensions: general, process, people and tools/techniques. A number of similarities between the concepts were found. For example, implementation of both concepts calls for a systems perspective where the dimensions of process-people- tools/techniques are linked holistically. Differences between the LPD and GPD concepts lie in: their goal and focus, value construct, process structure, performance metrics, and tools/techniques used. The findings do not unambiguously support that “green thinking is thinking lean” and consequently it cannot be argued that LPD and GPD are two sides of the same coin, meaning that LPD automatically leads to greener products or that GPD ensures improvements and efficiency in the product development process. However, it is reasonable to conclude that LPD and GPD belong to the same “currency”. That is, the concepts share a number of similarities that indicate a synergistic relationship. This synergistic relationship has been accentuated by a nine propositions where the potential for cross-field learning is shown.}

It is therefore important to achieve a win-win situation for the environment and economics. The green supply chain focuses on reducing environmental impact during product delivery and satisfying customer service level. However, such situations make the supplier selection problem more complex. Decision-makers need to balance between suppliers’ green levels and consumers’ aspiration levels. The supplier selection problem is a typical multiple criteria decision-making problem. In the green supplier selection problem, only a few studies consider the market segmentation of green consumers. However, the decision environment comprises supplier’s dynamic risk and goals with different importance is not considered. In the green supplier selection problem, to overcome key limitations of previous literature, this study includes several contributions. First, this study constructs a fuzzy goal programming model focusing on the importance of a supplier portfolio and order allocation. To improve satisfaction degree of the green goals, this study proposes a fuzzy goal programming model incorporating multiple importance function. The functions provide adequate satisfaction levels for goals with a lower priority. Second, this study pioneers the integration of a supplier’s dynamic risk and green market segmentation in supplier selection problems. Third, this study analyzes how different ratios of green consumers affect the satisfaction degree of the green goals. Green consumers are willing to convert green consciousness into actual consumption, and the proposed decision problem considers the market bonus by green consumers. The illustrative example, unlike previous studies, shows that the proposed model will not excessively compromised green goals with lower priority for certain decision situations.}

With respect to engineering, mobile apps provide a huge potential for increased flexibility and efficiency due to their anywhere and anytime characteristics, e.g., for product testing in the field. However, not every usage of mobile apps is beneficial from a business point of view and existing apps for engineering represent only rudimentary front-ends for stationary IT systems without an app-oriented redesign. Hence, there are three core challenges to leverage the potential of mobile apps in engineering: (1) identifying value-added app usage scenarios from a process point of view, (2) realizing a task-oriented and context-aware user interface design and (3) mastering technical obstacles at the app implementation. In this paper, we address these challenges by a case-oriented analysis of selected engineering processes in the automotive industry in order to identify engineering tasks suited for the usage of mobile apps. On this basis, we design corresponding engineering apps and analyze their business potentials. Moreover, we derive common technological challenges for the development of engineering apps, e.g. data synchronization aspects, and highlight further research issues.}

abstract = {Supplier selection is a complex decision-making process which is influenced by uncertainty and DM hesitation. To deal with this problem, various studies have proposed the use of methods based on Fuzzy Set Theory and its extensions. There are several varieties of Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic VIKOR (HFLVIKOR) methods in the literature which can use two or more linguistic terms in each evaluation and can generate solutions based on the group’s utility or individual regret. Despite these benefits, we have not found comparative studies involving HFLVIKOR methods to supplier selection. Given this gap, this study applies and compares Extended Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic VIKOR (EHFLVIKOR) methods and Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set VIKOR (PDHFLVIKOR) methods with Possibility Distributions within the supplier selection context. This application was realized using a service company. We also performed 8 scenario simulations to analyze the effect of including other criteria and alternatives. Despite the identified limitations of each method, we conclude that both are appropriate for dealing with group decision making under uncertainty and require little effort in their data collection. The PDHFLVIKOR results were more consistent in maintaining the ranking and the compromise solution in the real application as well as simulated scenarios. Unlike PDHFLVIKOR, EHFLVIKOR loses information when there is a consensus. On the other hand, because it makes it possible to create subgroups of DMs, EHFLVIKOR appears to be more appropriate for companies in which there is more than one DM involved in supplier selection for each functional area. This study’s results will help managers and academics in selecting the most appropriate method for supplier selection.}

Consequently, deriving a series of positively correlated association rules from workflows is essential to identify strong relationships among key business activities. These rules can subsequently, serve as best practices. We have addressed this problem by hybridizing genetic algorithm with association rules. First, we used correlation to replace support-confidence in genetic algorithm to enable dynamic data-driven determination of support and confidence, i.e., use correlation to optimize the derivation of positively correlated association rules. Second, we used correlation as fitness function to support upward closure in association rules (hitherto, association rules support only downward closure). The ability to support upward closure allows derivation of the most specific association rules (business model) from less specific association rules (business meta-model) and generic association rules (reference meta-model). Downward closure allows the opposite. Upward-downward closures allow the manager to drill-down and analyze based on the degree of dependency among business activities. Subsequently, association rules can be used to describe best practices at the model, meta-model and reference meta-model levels with the most general positively dependent association rules as reference meta-model. Experiments are based on an online hotel reservation system.}

Both dyes D36 and D34 crystallized in the triclinic and monoclinic systems in the centrosymmetric space groups P-1 and P21/n, respectively. The unit cell of D36 contains two molecules of the dye, participating in weak intermolecular interactions, whereas that of D34 contains four formula units. The phenolic hydroxy group of D34 participates in the formation of a hydrogen bond with the iodide anion. The 4-styrylquinolinium moieties of the cationic dye molecules are nearly planar. The dihedral angle between the mean planes through the ten-membered quinolinium system and the benzene ring is 7.5° in D36 and 5.9(1)° in D34. The structural parameters planarity and bond length alternation (BLA) are discussed, which are important for the evaluation of the first hyperpolarizability β at the molecular level, even in a centrosymmetric crystal. The UV–visible spectra of the dyes in 14 solvents of different polarities were investigated. The reversible solvatochromic behavior of the dyes is demonstrated experimentally and compared with known “binuclear dyes” by evaluating the Rezende model. Dye D36 does not fluoresce, and D34 has a very low emission in the solvents tested.}

Only recently, organizations increasingly consider SD as a business strategy because it can deliver larger shareholder value and provide access to capital and making stronger performance over time which can improve shared value for both business and society. Considering the present atmosphere where competition is the most important factor in asserting oneself and exerting influence in the developmental process, customer relationship management (CRM) and the significant influence it has brought about in the worldwide scene can be seen as one of the most influential factors contributing to the economic sphere. Applying this concept in higher education academic as a specialist manpower center of education, has led to a new concept named Student Relationship Management (SRM). This research by employing the CRM, a strategic leadership towards sustainable development in SRM and subsequently in higher education, addressed to identification of SRM factors with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (FA) in order to implementation of the SRM system. Thus, after identifying the quality elements of SRM, using FA through SPSS and Amos software, the new scale was standardized.

LPD deals with the complete process from gathering and generating ideas, through assessing potential success, to developing concepts, evaluating them to create a best concept, detailing the product, testing/developing it and handing over to manufacture. With the beginning of the fourth Industrial Revolution (Industrial 4.0) and the rising efforts to realize a smart factory environment, also product development has to perform a substantial transformation. This paper firstly describes the concept of Lean Product Development as well as new requirements for an intelligent and Smart Product Development (SPD) through the introduction of modern Industry 4.0 related technologies. Based on Axiomatic Design methodology, a set of guidelines for the design of Lean Product Development Processes is presented. These guidelines are linked with concepts from Industry 4.0 in Engineering, showing how a lean and smart product development process can be achieved by the use of advanced and modern technologies and instruments.}

Substantial improvement can only be achieved through development and application of a new generation of more suitable design paradigms, methods and tools. In this paper, some new opportunities and difficulties related to the system-on-a-chip technology are considered, the nature of the complex system design problems is analyzed and a quality-driven system design methodology is proposed and discussed.

The expected outcome is to provide every consumer with a produce that matches his or her unique mentality. The new challenges of CAPD are consisting of non-linear and complex interaction between the bio-response parameters and human mentality process involved. As the solution, the intelligent modeling of Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were proposed. Artificial human mentality was generated using BBN by Kansei approach. Kansei is defined as consumer mentalities which solicit their preferences reasoning. ANN was utilized to incorporate the mentality in the monitoring of production scheme. The implementation of CAPD scheme is demonstrated via a case study of Eco-produce of moss greening (Rhacomitrium canescens). The produce choices were harvested using the specific modules. The research objectives are: 1) to model the artificial human mentality using BBN by Kansei approach; 2) to incorporate the artificial human mentality in CAPD scheme using ANN. The result indicated that BBN attained satisfied accuracy. ANN was able to classify the modules using the mentality and choices. The modules were characterized by textural features and Likert scale's criteria. Both of the models were trained and validated based on benchmarking analysis (For BBN), sensitivity analysis (For ANN), minimum learning error and inspection data. Generally, the proposed CAPD is possibly applied for learning, mental simulation and monitoring in the early phase of customized produce development. Specifically it is applicable for Agro-industrial and Eco-produce design.}

abstract = {Group decision making in third-party logistics service selection plays an essential role for improving service quality, increasing efficiency and reducing the net cost. Fuzzy and uncertain linguistic variables are commonly used to represent experts‘rankings in optimization problems. To recognize the limits of human cognition and subjectivity of human evaluations, several optimization approaches have been studied to select remanufacturing alternatives in decision making processes, however these methods have certain deficiencies such as lacking manipulation tools of diverse information, randomness, use of predefined parameters increasing uncertainty, interpersonal relations among evaluation criteria. The integration of interval numbers, rough approximations, and cloud model theory plays a significant role to model incomplete and inadequate information occurring in decision making problems. This research paper focuses on the integration of dual interval rough integrated cloud model with best-worst optimization technique, Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) approaches. A novel min–max optimization model based dual interval rough integrated cloud values is designed to compute the weight coefficients and consistency ratio for each criteria. The consistency of proposed optimization model is checked using a consistency ratio test. Secondly, the alternatives are ranked using the proposed DIRI cloud based MABAC and WASPAS approaches using interval clouds based weighted sum and weighted product coefficients, approximation area values and distance formulae. The significance of the proposed model is highlighted with a case study of third-party logistics service management of an electronic firm. The rationality and out-performance of the proposed methodology is studied by a comparative analysis with existing approaches and detailed sensitivity analysis on different variations of criteria weights and parameter.}

Product design can have substantial impact on product remanufacturability and product EoL recovery strategy. Existing studies on design-based remanufacturability assessment are either based on design charts or consideration of simple embodiment design features. This paper presents a feature-based approach for remanufacturability assessment using comprehensive CAD information, e.g., bill-of-material, mating features, tolerance and dimension, etc. For each product component, a generic information model is defined to manage critical design features for remanufacturability assessment, which include both inherent attributes of the component and interrelations among connected components. The proposed approach assesses two critical aspects in remanufacturing, namely, part disassembly and recovery. Design evaluation based on the remanufacturing assessment and part EoL recovery strategy can provide feedback to enhance the product design to be more in line for sustainable manufacturing. A case study of an automotive part is presented to validate the proposed approach.}

Subsequently, we present a method – subjective objective system (SOS) – for generating optimal concepts in diverse disciplines. The method rests on four mathematical metaphors: it is composed of objective and subjective components, it allows varying degrees of precision in modeling, it works by decomposing a complex problem into smaller sub-problems, and it uses highly simplified evaluations. SOS not only structures the decision process but also outputs the optimal concept given the customer objectives, the company context, and the available constraints. This solution is obtained by quadratic programming that allows the method to handle very large problems and solve them in negligible time. SOS has been developed over years of practical experience and research, and has been used in numerous successful real projects. We illustrate the use of the method in a real project.}

But since there are a lot of criteria and alternatives to be considered, numerous decision making models have been proposed to provide a solution to this problem. Within this study, an integrated approach including fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to select the best supplier in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. The importance value of each supplier with respect to each product is obtained via fuzzy TOPSIS in the first stage. Then in the second stage, these values are used as an input in the mathematical model which determines the suppliers and the quantities of products to be provided from the related suppliers. So as to validate the proposed methodology, an application is performed in air filter sector.}

In the meantime, the supplier selection with considering resilient criteria is the new topic in this area. Resilient may be defined as sufficient flexibility in counteracting fluctuations. This study presents a new integrated efficiency measurement model combining statistical techniques, decision making, and mathematical programming for resilient supplier analysis. Also, a new combination of two methods of first aggregation and last aggregation is developed to take advantage of both. Methodologically, this paper applies principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. The PCA method is utilized to decrease the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. Besides, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed to determine the weights of the criteria and ranking the suppliers. Weights of the criteria are established using the DEA method, the entropy, and judgments of decision-makers (DMs) simultaneously. A case study of resilient supplier selection problems is resolved and compared with existing methods to prove the performance of the proposed model. As a way of calculating the weight of the criteria, this study analyzes the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the first and last aggregation approaches. Then, the results of the study are reported.}

abstract = {A new approach is introduced in this research to identify the optimal product design and its service plan concurrently through simulation-based evaluation considering the whole product life-cycle span. In this approach, the generic product design is modeled by an AND-OR tree with parameter variables, and the specific design candidates and their design parameter values are created from the AND-OR tree. In the same way, the generic service plan is modeled by an AND-OR tree with parameter variables, and the specific service plan candidates and their service parameter values are created from the AND-OR tree. In the whole product life-cycle span, the product components, parameter values and functional performances are changed due to service activities such as maintenances and repairs. Simulation approach is employed to evaluate serviceability of the product in its whole life-cycle span considering different product designs, design parameters, service plans, and service parameters. A multi-level and multi-objective optimization method is developed to identify the optimal product design, design parameter values, service plan and service parameter values. A case study is implemented to show the newly introduced optimal concurrent product design and service planning approach.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing enables the maximum utilization of residual value contained in spent mechanical and electrical products. With the rapid iteration of products, performance obsolescence emerges as the primary driver of product remanufacturing. Consequently, remanufacturing of spent products badly needs to shift from performance recovery to upgrading. However, remanufacturing upgrade design scheme is challenging to be effectively optimized, as it requires to flexibly balance the bidirectional customization demands of product residual value utilization and technical performance improvement considering diverse failure characteristics and upgrading demands. Therefore, an adaptive design optimization method is proposed. With the optimization objectives of improving technical performance and saving cost and energy, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based surrogate model is built to evaluate the design scheme. Design parameters are identified based on technical failure characteristics to quantify demands, and working conditions are simultaneously input to jointly guide the direction of design optimization. Then, to obtain the optimal design parameters, an adaptive design optimization model based on transfer learning and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA III) is constructed to attain autonomous adjustment to different bidirectional customization demands. Specifically, a sample adding strategy is designed to expand transfer learning data. Aiming at different expected working conditions, transfer learning is used to adaptively adjust the model parameters of CNN in each iteration to ensure its prediction accuracy. NSGA III is applied to solve the optimization model and generate design parameters that meet bidirectional customization demands. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in response to the challenge of converting abstract descriptions of improving technical performance of spent products into a mechanism model.}

abstract = {This study summarizes results from six case studies in Sustainable Product Development, based on a method developed in the Nordic Project for Environmentally Sound Product Development. In all, but one case, there are reported significant improvements in environmental performance of new products, compared to existing reference products. Proposed options for improvement would increase purchase cost in as many cases as it was reduced, whereas life cycle cost for the user of the product was mainly influenced positively. The improvement options did not influence on important customer quality parameters in most cases, and there was as many positive as negative relationships. Based on the results from the study, it is not possible to give a general rank of priorities of strategies and options for improvements. What are the best solutions depend to a high degree on the external conditions of the product systems, and what types of products are examined. A scenario model, based on real product data, shows that the optimal life time of a product with the most significant environmental impacts related to the user stage might approach the innovation cycle time, if increased eco-efficiency is the driving force of the innovation process. To reach a level of global sustainability, it is not sufficient to improve the eco-efficiency of each product as such. Major changes in the infrastructure for energy production, distribution and consumption, in transport infrastructure systems, and in management of material cycles in the society is necessary. It is proposed to use eco-effectiveness as a measure for environmental improvement of product systems, as an alternative to eco-efficiency.}

abstract = {The 21st century is associated with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the organic agriculture trend, making the utilization of high-quality fertilizers, abundant nutritional content, economical, and no affect to environment pollution. According to the new concept, clean agricultural production and organic agricultural products are not allowed to excessively use synthetic chemicals such as chemical fertilizers, and plant protection drugs, but priority is to use manure, organic fertilizers, and natural mineral fertilizers. Fertilizer must meet the balanced nutritional requirements of crops, maintain, and improve the fertility of the ground, protect the surrounding ecosystem, and leave harmful effects in agricultural products, products with high quality, safe for users and high economic efficiency for producers. To achieve the above goal, the selection of a fertilizer supplier is an important decision, supporting the supply chain's sustainable development, fertilizer supplier selection is a multicriteria decision making model, the decision maker must assess all qualitative and quantitative factors. In this paper, the author proposed an integer decision making model including Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS) for fertilizer supplier selection. The weightings of the criteria are calculated by using FAHP, COPRAS is then applied for ranking some potential fertilizer suppliers. The efficiency of the proposed models is proved by a case study conducted in a farm located in the south of Vietnam. This research is the first fertilizer supplier evaluation and se-lection model in Vietnam by interviewing experts and reviewing the literature. Re-search result is to provide a case study on evaluating supplier in agricultural supply chain utilizing the model proposed by the combination of FAHP and COPRAS models.}

abstract = {With the emerging trend of digital servitization, manufacturers have transformed toward developing and providing smart product-service system (smart PSS) which is considered with great potential. As a value co-creation strategy, the innovative design of smart PSS involves multiple stakeholders, and the decisions in the concept design stage are especially crucial for its success throughout the whole lifespan. However, recent studies have focused on developing the design methodology or decision approaches for it, with an absence of the systematic decision framework for smart PSS innovation design. Most of them held the customer-centric viewpoint without considering the aspect of multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation. To fill the gaps, this study proposes the UNISON framework of model-based innovation for smart PSS design from the perspective of collaborative innovation, to assist its innovative design and decision-making in the concept design stage. To illustrate the structured procedures and demonstrate the validity of this framework, it was applied in an empirical study for the innovative design of smart drainage equipment-service system. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework has been discussed from both theoretical and practical aspects. This study can provide systematic guidance for developing smart PSS innovative design strategies to facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborative innovation.}

abstract = {Developing innovative solutions begins with the identification of needs to represent customer value. This understanding is essential for entrepreneurs to test their hypotheses and deliver value propositions, especially in startups, where the degree of uncertainty is high, and the business model has no consolidation. To this end, different approaches, which are mostly supported by learning cycles of experimentation, have emerged to assess customer and stakeholder value in innovation projects. To understand how these approaches and practices represents an alternative for value identification and proposition, this study aims to demonstrate a method to conduct practices and techniques in innovative solutions to anticipate customer value during the front-end phases of a sustainable product. The main contribution is the application of the framework in the case of a startup focused on agriculture for the development of a grain drying machine. The main technology behind this innovation is the drying through oxyhydrogen burn, which is extracted from the water. The framework proved to be useful for organizing market-bound information to form customer value proposition. The results allow the startup to reduce or solve uncertainties in its business model, which are challenges inherent to the innovation market. The learning from the application of the framework resulted in a remodeling of the business model to achieve a broader public as the startup pivoted initial customer needs into product requirements.}
