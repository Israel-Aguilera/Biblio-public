However, lean implementation is not a straightforward process. Although a number of frameworks have been presented, still many companies find it difficult to implement lean. Furthermore, most of these roadmaps are for large manufacturing companies, and not for small and medium enterprises. Unfortunately, there is not a recipe that if used can guarantee a successful implementation. Furthermore, unsuccessful implementation can have a great impact on organization's resources, but even more importantly, affect employees and their confidence in lean philosophy. In the present paper, the most prominent lean implementation frameworks will be discussed, under the prism of the needs of SMEs. The challenges for the SMEs in their lean journey are discussed.}

Risk management seems to be a promising approach to identify and analyse critical processes. This paper presents a risk survey approach, based on the knowledge of existing methodologies for the ramp-up management. The applicability of these methods and tools depends on the project-specific risks within the sub-processes of the ramp-up phase. Hence, suitable indicators are necessary to monitor the risk drivers and sources and thus to identify the risks. Nevertheless, the adoption of suitable indicators from these sets for an individual pre-series project requires the derivation of a specific risk profile. Based on a framework of pre-series logistics sub-processes a survey approach will be presented, allowing to deduce risk profiles for ramp-up projects. Following, the results of an exemplary survey, which has been conducted at a German premium automotive manufacturer and the resulting logistical risk profile are presented. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on further research.}

These data will initially be used to assess the degree of damage (with relation to the Enhanced F scale) while also establishing a baseline for subsequent recovery monitoring. A spatial video system is used to collect data from the post-disaster landscape of Tuscaloosa which was hit by a large tornado in April 2011. This video, once processed, can be viewed within a Geographic Information System which combines street-level images with exact location. These data can be used to support ongoing recovery efforts, while also archiving a dataset suitable for the spatial analysis of the changing post-disaster landscape.}

In this regard, a comprehensive list of quantitative and qualitative leanness measures is extracted from the literature. The efficiency of organizations is assessed and optimized by DEA. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain a full ranking of leanness levels of organizations. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine impact of each leanness factor on lean strategy. The approach has been found fruitful while applying for a number of packing and printing organizations, in Iran, as a case study. Apart from evaluating overall lean performance metric, the proposed approach can evaluate the impact degree of leanness factors on each other as well as the impact of leanness factors on lean strategy. The result show that production procedure among the leanness measures has the most impact on leanness strategy in the organizations under study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that develops and implements an efficient decision-making procedural hierarchy to support leanness extent evaluation.}

An empirical case involving 33 evaluation criteria, 2 public and 3 private medical centres in Taiwan assessed by 18 evaluators from various fields of medical industry is solicited to demonstrate the proposed approach. The analysis result reveals that the service quality of private hospitals is better than public hospitals because the private hospitals are rarely subsidized by governmental agencies.

The growing emphasis on design for sustainability requires that the harmful side effects to workers, users, and local and global natural ecosystems must be minimized by reducing the rate of material and energy consumptions that lead to the harmful side effects. As corporations face stricter regulations on emissions, effluents, and solid waste disposal, they are forced to develop technologies for disassembly, re-manufacturing, and recycling as well as for higher energy efficiency products and processes. The challenge of design for sustainability has, therefore, forced corporate product strategists and product development planners to address the following series of questions: How to formulate a competitive product strategy for environmentally-safe product life cycle design? What should be the product life cycle? How long? Should the product be ‘sold” or ‘leased’? How to set correct competitive targets for product function, features, performance, quality and reliability? How should the product realization process be organized to ensure ‘designed-in’ quality into products without missing the product introduction target timing or target cost? Environmentally-safe product life cycle design requires the product design and manufacturing expertise at the stage of the product strategy formulation itself. A methodology for the formulation of competitive product strategy is presented as a starting point for design for sustainability.}

The causes of this problem were identified and classified into four categories which involved people, environment, equipment/materials and method/procedure. This study also offered ways to improve its operational performance and overcome the problem of poor service operations. The alternatives offered include (1) Quality Function Development which helped in determining what will satisfy the customers and where to put the quality effort, (2) Total Quality Management (TQM), (3) process focus which uses service blueprint to strengthen the interaction between customers and the restaurant, (4) layout, (5) human resource management, (6) practice of good supply chain management, and (7) maintenance to get the most benefits and trouble-free services out of the restaurant equipment by performing regular maintenance.

However, its potential benefits can only be fully realized if teachers are properly trained to utilize such tools. The rapid evolution of ICT also necessitates rigorous assessment of training programs by participants. Thus, this study proposes an evaluation framework based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to systematically evaluate such workshops designed for teachers. The evaluation model is decomposed hierarchically into four main criteria namely: (1) workshop design, (2) quality of content of the workshop, (3) quality of delivery of the content of the workshop, and the (4) relevance of the workshop. These criteria are further disaggregated into 24 sub-indicators to measure the effectiveness of the workshop as perceived by the participants based on their own expectations. This framework is applied to a case study of ICT workshops done in the Philippines. In this case, relevance of the workshop is found to be the most important main criterion identified by the participants, particularly on the new ICT knowledge that promotes teachers’ professional growth and development. The workshop evaluation index (WEI) is also proposed as a metric to support decision-making by providing a mechanism for benchmarking performance, tracking improvement over time, and developing strategies for the design and improvement of training programs or workshops on ICT for teachers.}

abstract = {The rapid development of intelligent algorithms has significantly expanded the range of algorithms available for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Selecting the appropriate algorithm for a specific task is crucial for effective PHM applications. Learning from past PHM cases is an effective way to automate algorithm recommendations, reducing reliance on expert experience. Human-AI collaboration provides new ideas for achieving this capability. However, in emerging fields or early-stage research, the limited number of cases—coupled with volatility and noise—often results in low recommendation accuracy and weak stability. To address this issue, we propose a multi-order random graph convolution network (MOR-GCN) within a case-learning paradigm. This method uses graphs to model and optimize case correlations, helping engineers narrow down algorithm choices to suitable candidates. We first develop a correlation modeling and optimization method based on a graph network, enhancing information aggregation between similar cases and reducing the impact of case noise on the recommendation model. Next, we design an ensemble recommender using MOR-GCN, which aggregates features of adjacent case nodes through a case correlation network graph (CCNG), further improving recommendation accuracy and stability through ensemble learning. Experimental results from a gearbox fault diagnosis case set demonstrate that the MOR-GCN model can automatically recommend fault diagnosis algorithms based on task attributes, achieving an average accuracy of 77.20 % for single recommendations and 89.90 % for fuzzy recommendations. This framework showcases the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist human decision-making in PHM, minimizing the dependency on expert knowledge during the PHM design stage.}

One method to achieve this is through specific and temporally regulated modification of proteins in order to alter structure and function. Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is known to have wide-ranging and substantial effects on cellular function, both as part of signalling network modulation and more directly by modifying the function of key proteins. In this study, we show that PTM regulation is differentially targeted at different areas of the proteome, and that cytoskeletal proteins involved in neuronal process extension and maintenance are both more heavily modified and more frequently regulated at a PTM level. This suggests a clear role not only for PTMs in these processes, but possibly also for heavy protein modification in general.
Biological significance
This study provides one of the most comprehensive sets of individual PTM site regulation data for mammalian brain tissue. This will provide a valuable resource for those wishing to perform comparisons or meta-analyses of large scale PTMomic data, as are becoming increasingly common. Furthermore, being focussed on protein-level events, this study also provides significant insight into detailed roles for individual modified proteins in the developing brain, helping to advance the understanding of the complex protein-driven processes that underlie development. Finally, the use of a novel bioinformatic analytical tool provides information regarding aspects of the PTMome which are not normally examined, and illuminates the role of PTMs on a more detailed, protein-centric and site-specific level in a biological context. The widespread yet uneven distributions observed will be relevant to those readers with an interest in the mechanisms of distribution of PTMS and their functions.}

abstract = {The study of volatile elements in crustal anatectic terranes may provide information about the role of fluid flow and fluid pathways during high temperature metamorphism. We have studied the distribution of Li and B in two migmatitic areas: the Peña Negra Anatectic Complex (central Spain) and the migmatites and leucogranites associated with the Ronda peridotites (southern Spain). They represent two contrasting cases in the behaviour of volatiles, particularly B, during anatexis. The Peña Negra migmatites are dominated by diatexites where it is possible to distinguish granitic leucosomes, melanosomes, metric to decimetric leucogranitic segregates, and decimetric to metric sillimanite-rich restitic enclaves. All lithologies are characterized by low B concentrations (mean values <30 ppm), and B is enriched in melanosomes/restites with respect to leucosomes/leucogranites. This may be due to the fact that a notable proportion of B can reside in restitic sillimanite. B concentrations in leucosomes and leucogranites can be explained by closed system anatexis. At Ronda, metatexitic and diatexitic migmatites underlie the Ronda peridotites, and diatexite and leucogranite dikes intrude the peridotites. Diatexites underlying the peridotites are characterized by cordierite+biotite±garnet as ferromagnesian phases, with rare or absent tourmaline, low B contents (<10 ppm), and cordierite±garnet leucosomes. Leucogranite dikes have high B concentrations (mean value≈400 ppm), with tourmaline being a common and, sometimes, the most abundant ferromagnesian phase. A genetic relationship between diatexites and leucogranites is strongly suggested by the presence of dikes of diatexites intruding the bottom of the peridotites. We conclude that B in the leucogranites may stem from the dissolution of tourmaline originally present in the metasediments, or infiltration of B-rich aqueous fluids into the anatectic zone. According to recent experimental work, textures in some tourmaline-rich Ronda leucogranites suggest initial B2O3 contents in the melt higher than the present measured concentrations. Preliminary experimental results presented in this paper propose that this difference is not due to water activities in the melt. Rapid crystallization of the melts following undercooling may explain the existence of abundant euhedral tourmaline in leucogranites with low aluminium saturation index (ASI=molar Al2O3/(CaO+Na2O+K2O)) and relatively low B contents.}

Contracts for manufactured goods are centered around a clearly defined junction between production and use, made possible by the properties of tangibility and portability of tangible goods, at which point responsibility for use, operation and consumption of the product is transferred from producer to customer, along with ownership. Service operations, by contrast, involve a lack of inventories and portability, customer contact, joint production, customer-specific inputs, and intangibility in varying degrees. Moreover, service operations are either entirely post contractual or interlinked with the contracting process. As a result, the very nature of service markets and contracting depends on the characteristics of the service operation. While the operational consequences of service characteristics have been explored quite widely, there is less understanding of the special features of service competition and its implications for service strategy. We provide a framework for describing, analyzing and explaining service competition and review some old and new models which address the special features of service markets.}

The research revealed that the capital cost of a LEED silver certified building in Jordan is around 20–25% over the traditional buildings' capital cost. However, the increased capital cost that clients’ in Jordan consider being acceptable for LEED is 5–10% - irrespective of the savings in operational costs.}

Besides, in this paper, a decision-making tool is provided to solve the sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem in a multi-period, multi-item, and multi-supplier environment considering quantity discounts and disruption risks. At first, one of the efficient Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches called Best Worst Method (BWM) is employed to find a global importance weight of each determined criterion and the preference weights of each potential supplier according to these criteria. Then the proposed MILP model attempt to minimize the total costs and maximize the total score of all suppliers in respect to three sustainability aspects. Also, in order to solve the proposed bi-objective mathematical model, a Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming (RMCGP) method is applied. Additionally, a consistency test is applied to check the quality of expert comments. To investigate the robustness of the approach, the sensitivity analysis is utilized. Also, a real-world case study in the north of Iran is presented to highlight the performance of the proposed model. Finally, the selected suppliers, amount of inventory and shortage, ordered quantity along with other variables are calculated. Also, based on sensitivity analysis, the effect of quantity discounts and disruption risks are revealed. The results approve the efficiency of the proposed approach.}

In the primary-diagnosis stage, the customer-complaint database is comprehensively analysed to identify themes and categories of complaints. In the advanced-diagnosis stage, a data-mining technique is employed to investigate the relationship between the categories of customer complaints and the deficiencies of the service system. In the review stage, the identified weaknesses of the service system are reviewed and awareness of these weaknesses is enhanced among the organisation’s employees. In the action stage, a strategy of action plans for improvement is developed. An empirical case study is conducted to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the ‘PARA’ model. The paper concludes by summarising the advantages of the proposed model and the implications for future research.}

A persona is a representative of a class of end users of a product or service. However, the majority of personas presented in the literature do not take into consideration that the personality of users affects the way they interact with a product or service. This study empirically explores variations in conceptual design based on the personality of a persona. We carried out two studies in Australia and one study in Denmark. We presented four personas with different personalities to 91 participants who collectively completed 218 design artifacts. The results from the studies indicate that the participants’ views and prioritization of the needs and system requirements were influenced by the personality traits of the provided personas. For an introverted and emotionally unstable personality, inclusion of confidence building and socializer design features had a higher priority compared with the identified requirements for an extravert and emotionally stable personality. The findings support the proposition that personas with personality traits can aid software engineers to produce conceptual designs tailored to the needs of specific personalities.}

Systematic operational hazard analysis is not a very common practice at the Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) based power plants in Bangladesh. Hence, a structured hazard evaluation framework can greatly benefit them to ensure their operational safety. This study has been conducted to identify and prioritise the operational hazards of the HFO-based power plants through using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach in a fuzzy environment, and then, to explore the appropriate mitigation methods for the top-ranked hazards and to find the interrelationships that exist among the mitigation methods. First, the most common hazards in HFO-based power plants have been identified from the expert feedbacks. Then, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method has been used to determine the weights of the evaluation criteria and a fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) method, has been used for the final ranking of the potential hazards. Afterwards, mitigation methods for the top 25 hazards have been identified and interrelationship among those mitigation methods has been explored through using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and a matriced impacts croisés multiplication appliquée à un classement (MICMAC) analysis. The study finds that ‘explosion of high-pressure steam drum of the gas boiler’, ‘crankcase explosion and fire hazard due to oil pressure rise’ and ‘explosion of the compressed air reservoir’ are the top three hazards in the hazard ranking. ‘Standard operating procedure (SOP) and training’ have been found to be the most driving mitigation methods for the top-ranked hazards based on the ISM-MICMAC analysis. The findings of this study are expected to provide the managers of power plants with valuable insights, which can help them to prepare sustainable operational strategies to ensure the least hazardous work environment.}

This study deals with the selection of technology acquisition mode as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. The proposed solution to the problem in this study, is the analytic network process (ANP) approach. Since the ANP is a MCDM method that can accommodate interdependency among decision attributes, it is capable of providing priorities of alternatives with consideration of interrelationships among strategic factors. The 21 influential factors identified from the empirical studies are included as sub-criteria in the ANP model, and they are grouped into five criteria: capability, strategy, technology, market, and environment. The final decision can be made based on the resulting priorities of the alternative acquisition modes. The proposed approach is expected to effectively aid decision making on which mode is adopted for acquisition of required technologies. A case of a software company is presented for the illustration of the proposed approach.}

With reference from some existing research and literature, an evaluation system is established, and then different criteria from economic, technical, and social aspects are considered for site selection of BSS. The TFN (Triangular Fuzzy Number) has been used to overcome the uncertainty due to insufficient information. Then, using Fuzzy based TFN Method with consideration of the preference within the criteria; weights of the criteria are obtained. Further COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives) methodology is applied to rank the selected locations in Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India. This paper concludes that the cost-related criteria like payback period, land acquisition cost, and machinery purchasing cost dominate other criteria. The area under Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the Western part of North 24 Parganas rank higher than other selected locations; thus, they are suitable for establishing BSS within the KMA, India.

The vast majority of the applications use a crisp point estimate method such as the extent analysis or the fuzzy preference programming (FPP) based nonlinear method for fuzzy AHP priority derivation. The extent analysis has been revealed to be invalid and the weights derived by this method do not represent the relative importance of decision criteria or alternatives. The FPP-based nonlinear priority method also turns out to be subject to significant drawbacks, one of which is that it may produce multiple, even conflict priority vectors for a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix, leading to entirely different conclusions. To address these drawbacks and provide a valid yet practical priority method for fuzzy AHP, this paper proposes a logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) based methodology for fuzzy AHP priority derivation, which formulates the priorities of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix as a logarithmic nonlinear programming and derives crisp priorities from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. Numerical examples are tested to show the advantages of the proposed methodology and its potential applications in fuzzy AHP decision-making.}

In this study, a facile method was put forward to impart both flame-retardant and anti-corrosive properties to epoxy resins, via chemically introducing bifunctional phosphorus-containing triazole derivatives (D-ATA). In the resultant epoxy thermosets, the phosphorylated triazole structure directly contributed to flame retardancy, while the triazole structure can effectively suppress the electrochemical corrosion. With only 5 wt% loading of D–ATA, the epoxy thermoset showed excellent flame retardancy with a high limiting oxygen index of 33.2%, V-0 rating in UL-94 tests and significant suppression of heat and smoke release in cone calorimetry tests. Meanwhile, the electrochemical corrosion tests confirmed that the corrosion protection efficiency of EP/5 wt% D-ATA increased by 95.3% in comparison to neat EP. Due to hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions caused by the introduction of D-ATA, the versatile epoxy thermoset also had enhanced mechanical properties with the improved tensile and flexural strength. Moreover, the anti-corrosion and flame-retardant mechanisms were also discussed in detail. This work provides a facial strategy for preparing versatile high-performance epoxy thermoset with fire safety and corrosion resistance for various applications.}

Opinions of many experts are obtained while building ANP model for the selection ERP then opinions are reduced to one single value by methods like geometric means so as to get desired results. To use ANP model for the selection of ERP for a new organization, a new group of expert’s opinions are needed. In this case the same problem will be in counter. In the proposed model, when ANP and ANN models are setup, an ERP software selection can be made easily by the opinions of one single expert. In that case calculation of geometric mean of answers that obtained from many experts will be unnecessary. Additionally the effect of subjective opinion of one single decision maker will be avoided. In terms of difficulty, ANP has some difficulties due to eigenvalue and their limit value calculation. An ANN model has been designed and trained with using ANP results in order to calculate ERP software priority. The artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained by results obtained from ANP. It seems that there is no any major difficulty in order to predict software priorities with trained ANN model.

abstract = {This paper introduces a method for the design of modular product platforms (MPP) for highly integrated mechatronic products applying axiomatic design and a system decomposition into mechatronic function modules (MFM). In the first step, using an extended axiomatic design approach, the complex system is decomposed into MFM. The application of axiomatic design ensures a strong function-orientation which is required in mechatronic system development. In the second step, the MFM are designed for use in a product platform. The methodology is applied in a case study considering the design of a MPP for electromechanical steering systems for use in personal vehicles.}

Although its opponents emphasize the program's inefficiency, its supporters claim that the program is crucial to accessing small and remote communities, which helps them develop economically and socially. This paper demonstrates the economic contributions of EAS flights to small and remote communities. Using a two-stage least squares estimation, the major findings indicate that a 1% increase in air passenger traffic in EAS airports with a minimum annual air passenger traffic of 1000 likely leads to a 0.12% increase in per capita income of the community served by that airport. Our results also suggest that EAS communities that are able to sustain their subsidized flights experienced higher per capita income growth in the 1999–2011 period than did ex-EAS communities that lost their flights as a result of non-eligibility.}

This study presents a business model canvas framework for public transportation organizations including an impact element and its external environment. The main and sub-criteria of the model are designed according to the literature under three hierarchical levels. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (f-AHP) is applied to the model with two extensions which are Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS) and Spherical Fuzzy Sets (SFS) to evaluate the proposed model. A solution set is also provided with a traditional AHP in order to check the robustness of the former methods. According to the results, the internal environment is ranked as the most important criteria at the first level for all methods. Whereas the activity element is ranked first at the second level, key partners are ranked first at the third level for all methods. The results show that IF-AHP and SF-AHP provide similar global weights but both of them provided divergent results from traditional AHP weights. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is sensitive to expert judgments. This study contributes to the works of both academicians and practitioners in terms of designing and evaluating public transportation business models.}

Since user preference is usually ambiguous, existing methods of preference extraction and assessment strongly rely on design experience and hard to analyze the implicit design preferences at semantic level. In addition, the abstraction of the knowledge representation prevents a reasonable judgment of the scheme’s potential value. To fill these gaps, by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) technology and semantic network, an integrated implicit design preference (DP) mining approach is proposed to support the uncertain conceptual design decision-making. The proposed approach has three parts: first, the design knowledge semantic network (DKSN) is constructed by using NLP and patent data, which provides a new retrieval mode for function solving; second, TF–IDF model is introduced to extract the DPs, a similarity matrix between the principle solution (PS) retrieved from DKSN and design characteristic (DC) is constructed using word vector model, which can mine the potential satisfaction of various DPs in each PS; and third, based on the satisfaction matrix of PSs, a normalized comprehensive value matrix of the schemes is constructed, and the optimal scheme is obtained using rough VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje). A case study of pipeline inspection trolley design is used to validate the proposed approach, sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed model truly captures the scheme’s intention. Additionally, the constructed DKSN has positive implications for assisting designers in exploring the design space.}

For electronics manufacturing enterprises, the pressure to maintain a competitive edge and the urgency to implement sustainable development makes the optimal selection of green supplier a necessity during operations. Although some studies have given some methods for green supplier selection, the consensus problem has not been sufficiently studied in the existing methods. In order to solve this problem, we propose a group consensus decision making framework to help choosing the best green supplier for electronics manufacturing. Firstly, decision makers’ preferences between the alternatives considered with respect to each criterion are elicited by the paired comparison method, and expressed as probabilistic linguistic preference relations. Secondly, a new consistency measure is defined and a convergent algorithm is described to aid the consistency improvement process in a given probabilistic linguistic preference relation. The algorithm adopts a local revision strategy and can be easily interpreted. Further, for the consensus model, in each round of this dynamic and interactive model, the most incompatible expert is asked to revise his/her judgment according to judgment feedback mechanism. If the expert rejects the suggestion, his/her weight of importance will be decreased based on the weighting feedback mechanism. Finally, a case study of selecting green supplier is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed group consensus decision making framework.}

abstract = {The management of medical waste disposal is a major challenge faced by different cities in developing countries. The choice of optimal medical waste treatment technology is a complex multi-criteria group decision-making problem that requires consideration of multiple alternatives against conflicting criteria. Decision makers evaluating disposal municipalities may conduct random evaluations from different linguistic term sets according to different preferences and contexts. Various fuzzy numbers based approaches have been studied in HCWM (health-care waste management) process, however they have certain limitations such as lacking manipulation tools of diverse information, additional adjustments and suppositions, ignoring randomness and multi-granularity in experts’ judgements. In response, this research article proposes a novel mathematical models by integrating 2-tuple linguistic setting into rough approximations and cloud theory. First, three novel linguistic manipulation models, namely, 2-tuple linguistic clouds, 2-tuple linguistic rough numbers and dual 2-tuple linguistic rough number (D2tLRN) clouds are developed to handle uncertainty with randomness and multi-granularity simultaneously. Secondly, a hybrid weighting scheme is utilized to evaluate the relative importance of waste factors using both subjective and objective aspects of uncertainty. Thirdly, the proposed D2tLRN cloud model is integrated with the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to design an evaluation approach for the selection of HCWM technologies. Finally, the application of the proposed method is studied with an empirical case study of health care waste management in the most crowded municipality. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed approach is also discussed in detail to study the effect of various parameters on the results. The out-performance and significance of the proposed D2tLRN cloud TOPSIS method is illustrated by comparing it with existing approaches.}

abstract = {Human activity depends on resources that are often consumed without regard for their future availability. Consequently, resources in the form of raw materials and finished products are widely dispersed across society, creating energetic challenges for resource management, since the processes of procuring materials, purifying and processing them, distributing goods, and collecting waste all require significant amounts of energy. The costs and energy requirements for these activities depend on factors such as the mode of transportation and the distance travelled. Efficient transportation strategies can help reduce the negative environmental impact of human activities and ensure the sustainable use of resources for future generations. Quantifying the impact of this transport requires specific and expert logistics management knowledge. The current approach relies on information that is often not readily available, making it impractical and costly. Fast and quantitative methods to support decision making are especially needed when evaluating different potential circular economy (CE) strategies and business models that aim to reduce environmental impact by keeping materials at a high functionality level by closing material cycles (e.g., through reuse, reparation, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling or material recovery). As a consequence, in this article, geospatial entropy definitions are studied as novel metrics to quantify the geospatial distribution of resources. The overall goal of this article is to review existing geospatial entropy definitions and evaluate their potential to be applied for assessing resource management strategies in view of a circular economy. In doing so, insight into the decision making behind the location of a value-added activity through a collection and processing of resources is gained, as well as how entropy can be used to support this. To achieve this, we analyse several definitions used in the field of urban sprawling, illustrate how they are calculated using conceptual examples, and translate these to relevant research questions for resource management. This analysis results in several promising definitions, which, in our view, are able to quantify the geospatial distribution of resources accurately. The resulting entropy value can then serve as a proxy for collection efforts. As a result, a viewpoint is presented on how these geospatial entropy definitions can support resource management decisions, such as the appraisal of resource/waste collection schemes and the location of processing and recycling facilities.}

Based on these definitions, we formalize the three heuristics proposed by Stone et al. into rules to identify functional modules in function structures: (1) sequential flow rule, (2) parallel flow rule and (3) flow transformation rule. The arithmetic for identifying functional modules based on these formalized rules is developed, and a computer-aided software tool is created to facilitate this process. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a function structure for a power screwdriver, and the results compare favorably to those obtained using the three heuristics.}

So far, too little research has shown clear empirical evidence on the actual impact of various parameters on GSCM performance of SMEs. In order to fill this knowledge gap, this research attempts to identify the critical GSCM parameter and quantitively measure its influence on the GSCM performance of an India-based SME. To this end, twenty important GSCM parameters are identified from an extant literature and verified by the experts. Data is collected through questionnaire development, expert committee formation, and conducting interviews. This research employs an integrated multivariate analysis-robust design approach, in which item analysis is used to check the consistency of the data and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine the weights of the parameters. The Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array analysis is used in which, qualitative data, quantitative data, and attitude of decision maker are taken as input parameters and a GSCM performance index is taken as a response parameter. The result reveals that, ‘Use of emission control system’ is the most critical GSCM parameter and the optimal combination of input parameters are: use of the emission control system (0.08); total carbon emission (0.37); attitude of decision maker (0.6), and the corresponding GSCM performance index is 0.196. The proposed framework may help decision makers identify and control a set of influential parameters for the best GSCM performance.}

The electricity demand of this sector, particularly that of high-speed railways, is increasing. Application of the existing infrastructures of railway stations and available land along rail lines for photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation has the potential to power high-speed bullet trains with renewable energy and supply surplus electricity to surrounding users. In this work, a methodology based on a geographic information system was established to evaluate the PV potential along rail lines and on the roofs of train stations. The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway (HSR) was used as a case study. Its total PV potential reached 5.65 GW (of which the station potential accounted for 264 MW, approximately 4.68%, of the total potential), with a lifelong generation capacity of 155 TWh, which corresponds to approximately 12% of the total new installed capacity of China in 2020. Although electricity prices and solar resources differed along the railway line, all PV systems were profitable. Moreover, a comparison between the electricity consumption and generation shows that the PV+HSR system can cover most of the electricity demand of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR without a storage system. This concept can be further expanded to other rail lines and stations. Within the context of global carbon peaks and carbon neutrality, the integration of PV and railway systems should be promoted.}

Mathematical proofs use a chain of deduction. Despite the unique contribution of TRIZ professionals to innovative problem solving, many researchers’ effort about the development of TRIZ was based on induction rather than deduction. The Butterfly model for contradiction problem solving uses symbolic notations, and the model carries out the logical proofs of the validities of the conditional propositions by using truth tables. The Butterfly model provides the right solution strategy to solve the problems and reduces the solution space of the problems systematically. Many TRIZ researchers have argued that for a given contradiction problem, the contradiction resolution was much more innovative than any other compromise solutions which accommodated both conflicting requirements. In effect, they treated compromise-based solution strategies as naive methods. Unlike the viewpoint of the traditional TRIZ, this study suggests that the compromise is an effective alternative to solve contradictions. To prove this assertion, we firstly analyze a few contradiction problems with the Butterfly diagram. And then, we classify the types of contradiction relations and identify the conditions how the compromise approach resolves the contradiction systematically. In order to achieve the research objectives, this study explains the Butterfly model and its relevant cases.}

abstract = {In order to improve competing power against rival companies, manufacturers need to release highly-valued new products for customers over a short amount of time. Because of this situation, in this paper, we want to focus on the efficiency of conceptual design stage after product planning stage. In particular, even if engineers grasp customer needs in real field, it's not easy to convert good ideas for customer needs into a commercial reality. In most cases they decide on the final design proposal based on trial and error. So, they have to spend a lot of time, obsessed with the fixed idea that their experience and flair is the best. That's why we thought respecting “The Independence Axiom (Axiom1)”and” The information Axiom (Axiom2) at “The Axiomatic Design Theory” is directly linked to the efficiency of conceptual design stage. Axiom1 and 2 are respectively to maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs) and minimize the information content of the design. To be more precise, we try to standardize effective conceptual design process, utilizing “Contradiction Matrix (CM)” for Axiom1 and “Information Integration Method (IIM)” for Axiom2IIM is an evaluation technique that enables quantitative evaluation based on the concept of Shannon's information theory, bundling different kinds of features not only performance but also sensitivity field together in a group as a universal scale called “Information”. In this paper we take the evolution of paper cup from past to present as a case example. Based on the proposed conceptual design process wetry to propose next generation paper cup, respecting both Axiom 1 and 2. In addition, we would like to show that the proposed next generation paper cup will be basically in line with technical evolution laws from TRIZ.}

The query performances of pivot-based index algorithms can be significantly improved by properly choosing the set of pivots that is able to narrow down the database elements to only those relevant to a query. While many other approaches in the literature rely on empirical studies or intuitive observations and assumptions to achieve effective pivot strategies, this paper addresses the problem by using a formal mathematical approach. We conclude in our study that the optimal set of pivots in vector databases with Lp metrics is a set of uniformly distributed points on the surface of an n-sphere defined by these metrics. To make the study mathematically tractable, a uniform distribution of data in the database is assumed, allowing us to outline the problem from a purely geometrical point of view. Then, we present experimental results demonstrating the usefulness of our characterization when applied to real databases in the (Rn,Lp) metric space. Our technique is shown to outperform comparable techniques in the literature. However, we do not propose a new pivot-selection technique but rather experiments that are designed exclusively to show the usefulness of such a characterization.}

The selection of qualified construction contractor has been generally formulated and addressed as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem. However, few existing studies have taken the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes into account. Therefore, a two-stage logic scoring of preference-ELECTRE III-based approach is established for the management and manipulation of bidder selection. In a bid to facilitate expert evaluation articulation, alternative-attribute assessments in this approach take the form of generalized comparative linguistic expressions, which are subsequently converted into possibility-distribution-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set via the similarity measure-based generation approach to enhance information quality and reliability. Then, nonlinear optimization-based direction rules are introduced to advance the automatic minimum-distance-based consensus reaching model and based on which, the individual semantic-embedded assessments are algorithmically adjusted to reach acceptable consensus. Furthermore, the expert and attribute importance degrees are extracted from both semantic and formal logic aspects, and the modified individual assessments are gathered by integrating the two-stage logic scoring of preference aggregation structure and the ELECTRE III method. The present approach provides a solution to bid evaluation problems considering the reasoning logic pattern in human cognition process and the compensatory among attributes. A practical case study and a comparative analysis are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the established multi-attribute group decision-making approach.}

Globalization is the phenomenon that the degree ofglobal human interaction increases to such an extent that both its primary effects and the reactions it provokes give rise to numerous new developments. The qualitative jump to globalization can be understood an interaction between economy, technology (communications, electronics) and politics. This proposal involves the development ofa strategy to maximize design in Simultaneous Engineering environment. Current environment consider local suppliers and own design by the companies. This proposal involve global suppliers and subcontracting. Subcontracting can be either “specialization oriented” or “capacity oriented”. Nowadays subcontracting can be “competence oriented”. The results of this are lower costs and development time. Thus, these designs are competitive in actual context, with global competitors disputing the market.}

It is also argued that modern and interactive communication tools provide a means for managing and acquiring a better understanding of physically dispersed product development and manufacturing operations. It is concluded that by establishing clear documentation protocols to track the evolution of the product during its life cycle and by exploiting the modern communication media to implement simple managerial principles, project management can master the dispersed multi-project environment of today's manufacturing companies better. At its best, organisational learning can be a continuous and self-feeding process catalysed by advanced on-line metrics visualising the product development process.}

abstract = {Purpose
To provide insight into the preoperative factors that affect outcome after pneumatic retinopexy (PR) for treatment of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair. Additionally, we sought to analyze the cost of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair in the United States to determine potential cost savings with pneumatic retinopexy.
Design
Single-center, retrospective, observational consecutive case series and third party payer-perspective comparative cost analysis.
Participants
We included 141 eyes undergoing pneumatic retinopexy for the treatment of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
Methods
Preoperative characteristics, anatomic outcomes, and best-available visual acuity were collected. Anatomic and visual outcomes were analyzed based on the presence of selected preoperative factors. The primary cohort was divided into 2 groups based on preoperative characteristics: (1) traditional pneumatic retinopexy and (2) nontraditional pneumatic retinopexy. Comparative cost analyses were performed between pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, and vitrectomy.
Main Outcome Measures
Anatomic and visual outcomes at 6 months.
Results
Overall anatomic success was 78.7% and visual acuity improved significantly (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] 0.48–0.25; P < 0.005). A 97.6% final anatomic success rate was achieved. Anatomic outcomes were similar between traditional versus nontraditional (84.1% vs 74.4%; P = 0.16), phakic versus pseudophakic (79.1% vs 78.0%; P = 0.88), and macula-on versus macula-off (77.9% vs 81.1%; P = 0.68) groups. Anatomic failure was predicted by the presence of an inferior retinal break (P < 0.005) or visible vitreous traction on a retinal break (P = 0.04). Visual outcomes were similar between each of the traditional versus nontraditional (logMAR 0.21 vs 0.27; P > 0.05) and phakic versus pseudophakic groups (logMAR 0.23 vs 0.28; P > 0.05). Visual outcomes were better in macula-on detachments compared with those in which the macula was detached (logMAR 0.18 vs 0.42; P < 0.005). Annual health care cost savings in the United States ranging from $6 to $30 million are theoretically possible by increasing pneumatic retinopexy utilization from the current rate of 15% to 20%–35%.
Conclusions
Pneumatic retinopexy is an effective treatment modality for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Anatomic and visual outcomes are similar for traditional and nontraditional preoperative inclusion criteria, as well as phakic and pseudophakic eyes. Inferior breaks and visible vitreous traction on a tear predicted failure. Increased utilization of pneumatic retinopexy would achieve significant cost savings while maintaining outcomes.}

This study examined the concentrations of 22 elements in 161 macroalgae blade samples from 19 species (5 unidentified) across 3 phyla in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. Macroalgae blades collected from coral reef habitats exhibited higher concentrations of K, As, and Sr compared to those from seagrass meadows, but had lower levels of total nitrogen (TN), Na, Mg, Al, P, S, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn. These differences may be attributed to the limited or absent sediment in coral reef habitats, as sediment in seagrass meadows acts as a trap for heavy metals, influencing element accumulation. In the Southern Red Sea, macroalgae blades showed lower Sr levels but higher total organic carbon (TOC), TN, P, and Cd than those in the North, a trend influenced by nutrient inflows from the Indian Ocean and the semi-enclosed structure of the Red Sea. The study found that macroalgae blades had lower mean TOC and TN content than seagrass and mangrove leaves from the same research cruises but higher levels of Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, and Pb. Among the surveyed red, green, and brown macroalgae blades, Halymenia sp., Caulerpa taxifolia, and Dictyota sp. had the highest TOC, TN, and P contents, while Amphiroa fragilissima, Udotea flabellum, and Padina sp. had higher trace metal contents. Notably, some macroalgae blades, including red macroalgae A. fragilissima, green macroalgae Halimeda tuna, U. flabellum, and brown macroalgae Padina pavonica, Turbinaria ornata, collected from Al Birk, Al Lith, Thuwal, Yanbu, and Al Wajh exhibited concerning levels of Cr (~10.9 mg kg−1) and Ni (~27.2 mg kg−1), surpassing toxicity thresholds.

By forming an alliance, shipping companies can exchange their container slots to better satisfy the shipping demand and improve capacity utilization. This paper considers the slot allocation and exchange for a shipping alliance with consideration of profit-sharing agreement and uncertain demand. The profit-sharing agreement indicates the profit segmentation that should be kept by each alliance member among the total alliance profit. To tackle this problem, a two-stage stochastic programming model is subsequently developed to maximize the total profit of the alliance and minimize the deviation of the profit percentage of each member from the prescribed value indicated in the profit-sharing agreement. In the first stage, the number of slots allocated and exchanged within the alliance is determined. In the second stage, after the uncertain shipping demand is realized, each alliance member separately determines their container shipping plan to obtain profit. A tailored pattern-search-based solution algorithm is developed to solve the model. A series of numerical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the programming model and deliver several interesting managerial insights.}

The present model demonstrates how software security vulnerabilities can be calculated using linguistic terms. Therefore, the proposed method has a more flexible structure than this system. The current Common Vulnerability Scoring System formula and scores were used to assess and implement the presented model. The aim was to form a fuzzy model called the Fuzzy Common Vulnerability Scoring System based on the success probabilities which are defined using linguistic terms such as low, very low or high. Moreover, the Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR) method was used to define the relationship between the exact inputs and fuzzy multiple outputs, and the Least Squares Method was used to estimate the parameters of the presented model. The performance of the model was evaluated by a comparison using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Kim and Bishu’s criterion. Validity of the fuzzy regression model is demonstrated with different fitness functions. The expectation was that more practical estimations with better error tolerance can be achieved by using linguistic terms to assess common vulnerabilities.}

Next, the definition of multi-hesitant linguistic term sets (MHFLTSs) is reviewed, which can eliminate the limitations associated with HFLTSs and HFLSs as well as emphasize the significance of repeated values. Then, a likelihood function is developed for multi-hesitant fuzzy linguistic term elements (MHFLTEs) based on a generalized function of the possibility degree of real numbers. Using this generalized function based on linguistic scale functions, alternatives that satisfy certain properties can be selected according to various semantic situations and the preferences of decision makers. Finally, the likelihood function of MHFLTEs is embedded into TODIM to address decision-making problems in which decision makers exhibit bounded rationality, and hesitance and repetitiveness exist in the linguistic evaluation information. According to the results of the illustrative examples and comparative analysis, the proposed approach can be used to effectively solve multi-criteria decision making problems involving the selection and evaluation of third-party logistics service providers.}

Well-known names such as “Local Motors” are a prime example for its success. But there are also concepts, which limit the sustainability of this success and can, consequently, lead to failure. Thus, it requires more than an analysis of successful projects to discover successful approaches. The reasons for the failure of other approaches are crucial. Based on the principle of “Survivorship Bias”, success is more visible than failure. This inevitably leads to an overestimation of the prospects of success. For this purpose, different concepts were analyzed and a concept of Open Community Manufacturing – Development Challenge was created. This paper aims to describe the challenges and potentials of open source innovation and wants to present the concept based on an open design strategy, using the example of South Africa.}

Non-random high prevalence regions were identified, the majority of which (84% of the population underlying all regions) exhibited clusters for all four respiratory diseases. GWR provided further evidence of spatial correlation (R2=0.991) between the communicable and noncommunicable diseases under investigation, suggesting spatial interdependence in risk. Sensitivity analyses of known respiratory disease risks did not fully explain our results. Prospective epidemiology studies are needed to clarify all contributors to risk.}

The coupling relations between pump unit and pipeline are uncovered through the research on external characteristics of centrifugal pump and the hydraulic characteristics of long distance pipelines. These relations are verified by theoretical study and field experiment. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method reduces the high false alarm rate which caused by coupling state of pump unit. The result shows that the proposed method can guarantee the effectiveness and accuracy of safety operation in long-distance pipeline.}

Data from 95 projects across several industries suggest that the use of output control and team rewards leads to higher customer interactivity. However, heavy reliance on process control can lead to reduced customer interactivity if not also accompanied with output controls. This study extends our understanding of using management controls to integrate the voice of the customer into new product development.}

Among these definitions are: quality is the fitness for use [14], conformance to requirements [4], quality is a predictable degree of uniformity and dependability, at low cost and suited to the market [6]. Cost of quality is an essential element of the total cost of any construction project. Consequently, the accurate assessment of such cost of quality can materially affect the reliability of the estimated cost of any construction project. Stated differently, the accurate and reliable cost estimating for any construction projects is not really possible without the deep investigation for the expected cost of quality of this project. Cost of quality is generally affected by many factors. Any attempt to assess the cost of quality of any project should take the different cost of quality factors into consideration. The main objective of this paper is to establish a neural network model that will enable the construction firms to assess cost of quality for any future building project. This will improve the company’s performance and its ability to compete with other companies through the improvement of bids accuracy. The “Neural Connection 2.0 Professional” was chosen to generate the proposed model. The main factors affecting the expected cost of quality were clearly identified. The different sequences of the model development will be deeply investigated. Moreover, the validity of the proposed model will be evaluated using a number of case study applications.}

Results show that the MDDP reduces the probability of re-offense by 16%, after adjusting for possible selection bias. Cox proportional hazard modeling is also used to assess time-to-re-offense differentials between the treatment and comparison groups. The survival analysis indicates that the hazard rate of re-offense is 60% lower per day among those treated with the MDDP program than those who did not complete the program. The average number of days to re-offense among those that do re-offend is 297 days in the treatment group and 203 days in the comparison group.}

abstract = {The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a performance management tool that analyzes the relationship between tangible and intangible assets. Its ability to render business strategy visible has earned it the distinction of being a strategic management model. Sustainability has become an important part of daily and business life today. With the increasing importance given by stakeholders to environmental and social issues, companies find it necessary to evaluate sustainability activities in their performance evaluations. In order to meet this need, the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) emerged with the addition of a sustainability perspective or parameters to BSC. The number of academic studies pertaining to the application of BSC, which numerous companies and subjects to research have utilized, is inadequate. Due to its hierarchical structure and the necessity to evaluate numerous criteria, BSC is suitable for using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. In this paper, an integrated approach consisting of SBSC, the Picture Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PF-AHP), and the Objective Matrix (OMAX) method is proposed for the performance measurement of companies. The PF-AHP method has been reorganized for ease of application in determining the perspectives, strategic objectives, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) weights within SBSC. Additionally, the OMAX method has been employed for calculating the performance scores. This proposed approach was implemented in a factory operating in the glass industry. The SBSC created for the company includes five perspectives, 16 strategic objectives, and 34 KPIs. PF-AHP method was used to determine the weights of perspectives, strategic objectives, and KPIs to be used in the performance score calculation with OMAX. The weight of financial perspective is 0.267, the weight of the customer perspective is 0.247, the weight of the internal process perspective is 0.191, the weight of the learning and development perspective is 0.161, and the weight of the sustainability perspective is 0.134. The evaluations made by the decision-makers indicate that the company's performance measurement still adheres to the traditional framework. The performance score of the company is 6.14 out of 10.}

However, existing methods often require more comparisons, omit criteria objective weights, and consider less about the impact of information subjectivity and impreciseness on the Smart PSS design concept selection. To solve the problems, a new integrated method is proposed, which integrates both subjective and objective weights to improve the accuracy of evaluation. Firstly, for criteria weighting, the proposed approach integrates the merits of the Best Worst Method (BWM) in reducing the burden of pair-wise comparisons when determining the subjective weights, and the strengths of the Criteria Importance Though Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) method in considering the correlation and contrast between all criteria when determining the objective weights. Then, Rough Set Theory is used to flexibly deal with the decision-making vagueness without much prior information. Finally, a case study of a smart washing machine is adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {A project manager makes decisions based on what he or she sees and understands. In large, complex projects (or programs), a manager cannot see the entire “territory” between project start and completion and therefore must rely on models or “maps” to support planning and decisions. When it comes to planning and coordinating work, project managers commonly use a variety of process model views such as flowcharts, Gantt charts, responsibility assignment matrices, and narrative descriptions. However, these views may not contain the right information to best support the purpose or decision at hand. This paper investigates the fit between model views (a kind of technology) and the managerial decisions (a kind of task) they support. Through analysis of the literature and case study data, this research identifies: (1) a set of 28 purposes for which managers draw upon process models for decision support, (2) a set of 15 views of process models, and (3) a set of 56 information attributes involved in supporting the purposes and provided by the views. The paper develops new measures of the sufficiency and extraneousness of the attributes for each purpose and view. Analysis of the evidence suggests substantial misalignment between managers’ purposes and tools. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, the paper discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of these results and contributes a new construct, purpose-view alignment, which may help explain project success in future studies. The paper also presents insights for researchers and managers on how to develop customized views that are more suitable for particular managerial tasks.}

In particular, it is observed that the boundaries between smart phones, digital cameras, and tablets are becoming more and more blurred than before. Therefore, for attracting the ad-hoc segments, global companies began to develop hybrid pad-phones and phone-cameras. Unfortunately, some of these products are facing poor sales without incurring much market attention. In order to overcome the aforementioned difficulty, this paper presents a novel framework to reduce the gaps between producer expectation and user perception. By means of the TRIZ (the theory of inventive problem solving), a contradiction matrix is applied to handle engineering conflicts among multi-functional alternatives to seek inventive solutions. Then, ARM (association rule mining) is conducted to identify critical features that formulate customer dissatisfaction (purchase intention). Finally, CA (conjoint analysis) is employed to derive customer utilities for benchmarking varieties of design concepts. In summary, the proposed framework cannot only help product planners efficiently generate innovative ideas, but also effectively justify the validity of design concepts.}

In user experience (UX) based design innovation, user-generated data and archived design documents are two valuable resources for various design activities such as identifying opportunities and generating design ideas. However, these two resources are usually isolated in different systems. Additionally, design information typically represented based on functional aspects is limited for UX-oriented design. To facilitate experience-oriented design activities, we propose a twin data-driven approach to integrate UX data and archived design documents. In particular, we aim to extract UX concepts from product reviews and design concepts from patents respectively and to discover associations between the extracted concepts. First, a UX-integrated design information representation model is proposed to associate capabilities with key elements of UX at the concept, category, and aspect levels of information. Based on this model, a twin data-driven approach is developed to bridge experience information and design information. It contains three steps: experience aspect identification using an attention-based LSTM (Long short-term memory) network, design information categorization based on topic clustering using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LAD (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model, and experience needs and design information integration by leveraging word embedding techniques to measure concept similarity. A case study using healthcare-related experience and design information has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.}

abstract = {Automotive manufacturing enterprises face many challenges today. Remaining as one of the biggest among them is delivering value to the customers through product quality. Moreover, good manufacturing or technical quality does not always result in high perceived quality from a customer perspective. At the same time, perceived quality is a property that has to be incorporated into the product during the whole product lifecycle, from design to production. Throughout the production stage, every manufacturing operation contributes to the building of final product's perceived quality. Thus, there is a need to control manufacturing operations related to this matter. This paper addresses the connection of the perceived quality framework, which defines dimensions of the perceived quality, to a manufacturing model that represents the manufacturing variation and propagation during different assembly operations. The aim of the study is to overcome boundaries between manufacturing and perceived quality. An industrial example, within the automotive premium sector, has been used to draw this connection illustrating the case of welded assemblies.}

abstract = {Customers prefer to purchase products with more features, but after using the products, they may become dissatisfied with the usability problems of the products. This phenomenon is called “feature fatigue”. Thus it is imperative to analyze product usability in product definition stage. However, most traditional methods of usability evaluation are generally carried out using prototypes which are not available until in the later stage of product development. This paper proposes an approach based on Web mining to analyze product usability. This approach uses the massive online customer reviews on analogous products and features as data source, which are easy to get from Web and can reflect the most updated customer opinions on product usability. Association rule mining techniques are adopted to extract customer opinions on the usability of product features. The Apriori algorithm is used for mining association rules, based on which a usability evaluation method is then presented. A case example is given to validate the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Large amounts of online reviews, the valuable voice of the customer, benefit consumers and product designers. Identifying and analyzing helpful reviews efficiently and accurately to satisfy both current and potential customers’ needs have become a critical challenge for market-driven product design. Existing evaluation methods only use the review voting ratios given by customers to measure helpfulness. Due to the issues such as viewpoints of interest, technical proficiency and domain knowledge involved, it may mislead designers in identifying those truly valuable and insightful opinions from designers’ perspective. Thus, in this study, we initiate our work to explore a possible approach that bridges the opinions expressed by consumers and the understanding gathered by designers in terms of how helpful these opinions are. Our ultimate research focus is on how to automatically evaluate the helpfulness of an online review from a designer’s viewpoint entirely based on the review content itself. We start our work by first conducting an exploratory study to understand the fundamental question of what makes an online customer review helpful from product designers’ viewpoint. Through our study, we propose four categories of features that reflect designers’ concerns in judging review helpfulness. Based on our experiments, it reveals that discrepancy does exist between both online customer voting and designers’ rating. Furthermore, for the cases where review ratings are not steadily available, we have proposed to use regression to predict and interpret review helpfulness with the help of the aforementioned four categories of features that are entirely extracted from review content. Finally, using review data crawled from Amazon.com and real ratings given by design personnel, it demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal and it also suggests that helpful product reviews can be identified from a designer’s angle by automatically analyzing the review content. We argue that the study reported is able to improve designer’s ability in business intelligence processing by offering more targeted customer opinions. It highlights the urgency to uncover sensible user requirements from such quality opinions in our future research.}

abstract = {A quantum mechanical analogue of the classically chaotic triple-well oscillator under the influence of an external field and parametric excitation has been studied by using the quantum theory of motion. The on the fly calculations show the correspondence between some dynamical aspects of the classical and quantum oscillators along with a strictly quantum mechanical behaviour in case of diffusion and tunneling. Suitable external conditions have been obtained which can either assist or suppress the movement of quantum particles from one well to another. Quantum interference effects play a critical role in determining the nature of the quantum dynamics and in the presence of strong coupling to the external forces, quantum interference effects reduce drastically leading to decoherence of the quantum wave packet. In such situations, quantum dynamical features qualitatively resemble the corresponding classical dynamical behaviour and a correspondence between classical and quantum dynamics is obtained.}

abstract = {Objective
As a result of the California heat wave in July 2006, county coroners reported that the high temperatures during that period caused approximately 147 deaths. However, heat wave-related deaths are likely to be underreported due to a lack of a clear case definition and the multi-factorial nature of heat-related mortality. Public health policy suggests a need for a careful assessment of mortality following a heat wave. In addition, it is useful to provide a comparison of the mortality impact per degree change during heat waves versus high temperatures observed during non-heat wave periods.
Design
Daily data were collected for mortality, weather and ozone in seven California counties impacted by the July 2006 heat wave. The association between apparent temperature and daily mortality was assessed using a Poisson regression model and combined across counties in a meta-analysis. These results were then used to estimate the increases in the number of deaths during the heat wave.
Results
Our analysis indicated that during the July heat wave, there was a 9% (95% CI=1.6, 16.3) increase in daily mortality per 10° Fahrenheit (F) change in apparent temperature for all counties combined. This estimate is almost 3 times larger than the effect estimated for the full warm season of May–September, during the non-heat wave years. Our estimates also determined that actual mortality during the July 2006 heat wave was 2–3 times greater than the coroner estimates.
Conclusion
This multi-county analysis provides additional evidence that the attributable risk of mortality following a heat wave may be underestimated by examining only direct heat-related deaths. In addition, we have found that the mortality effect per °F is several times higher than that reported during non-heat wave periods.}
