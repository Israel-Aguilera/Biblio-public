abstract = {China is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and consumers of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications. Current estimates show that China will need over 3billion RFID tags to satisfy demand in the year 2009. The applications for RFID patents have spread across a very diverse range of inventions and in the future it is likely that most products manufactured in China will contain an RFID tag. China’s RFID industry has grown along with the demand and researchers are making significant technological advances. In this research, patent data from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China (SIPO) have been used to explore RFID technology development and its trends. Patent abstracts containing the keyword and phrase “RFID” and “Radio Frequency Identification” were collected for analysis, content extraction, and clustering. In total, 1389 patents from the SIPO database covering the years 1995–2008 were retrieved and archived for analysis. Patents provide exclusive rights and legal protection for inventors, play an important role in the development and fair diffusion of technology, and contain detailed specifications necessary to define and protect the boundaries of an invention. Through patent analysis, companies monitor the development of technology and evaluate the position of potential competitors in the market. This research introduce a methodology which combines patent content clustering and technology life cycle forecasting to find a niche space of RFID technology development in China. A patent content clustering method is used to cluster different patent documents into homogenous groups, and then technology forecasting is applied to evaluate possible market opportunities for future inventors and investors. The results suggest that the cluster called RFID wireless communication devices has entered the saturation stage and thus provides limited opportunity for development. Four other clusters; RFID concepts and applications, RFID architecture, RFID tracking implementation, and RFID transmission apparatus, have entered the mature stage. The RFID frequency and waves cluster appears to be in early growth stage with good development potential. Since the technology related to basic RFID concepts and devices has reached a mature stage in China, the research and development seems to be targeting the improvement of the RFID frequencies and waves as a means to develop more reliable RFID systems and applications.}

The objective of the research framework is to improve reuse of geometry by providing relevant geometry-based product information, so-called geometric product views, through application of configuration management. In order to provide relevant product views, specific fundamental product information must exist. This type of information will vary depending on the different types of product views. Several examples on product view are presented. The product views are realised by a developed configuration management system, an example of a configured product view is presented as proof of concept. The configuration management system is currently under industrial implementation.}

Therefore, to recognize the impact of the decision maker’s cognition on the validity of the information provided, this paper develops a fuzzy group decision making method based on the generalized fuzzy soft set (GFSS). We apply the Bonferroni mean operators to develop the GFSS Bonferroni mean operator, which can be used for aggregating the information gleaned from the decision makers into collective information, and we construct the GFSS to revise the information provided by the decision makers (DMs). A similarity measure between the GFSSs is proposed and is used to identify the DMs’ weights. Finally, an illustrative example highlights the proposed method and demonstrates the solution characteristics.}

abstract = {This paper aims at contributing to Eco-Efficiency and Design for Sustainability by debating on the impact of design choices on Quality of Life. During the last two decades Eco-Efficiency has been characterized by an unbalanced evolution: the progression of scientific knowledge and industrial practice on resources assessment has not been followed by an equivalent attention to the contribution of product functionality and related performance to users' quality of life. Starting from this consideration, the paper highlights that by concentrating resources on attributes that effectively improve the quality of life, a company would be able to enhance product sustainability. Actually, the typical background of a product designer is often limited in terms of specific tools and techniques for sustainability practices, and certainly there is a lack of means to analyze the relationship between customer requirements and product impact on customer's life. The present work proposes to connect the ultimate objectives of design, quality of life or well being, to product requirements, with the aim of maximizing their proper fulfillment within a sustainable approach. The proposed prototype procedure drives the development team to consider the final effect of each characteristic of the product within the customer's life and assists the selection of different conceptual solutions. A case study related to Beauty and Grooming illustrates the proposed procedure and allows to discuss its potential and limits.}

To improve the homogeneity of batches received by final users and to detect manufacturing defaults, a visual control stage is integrated into production line before the packing operation. At this stage, the products are inspected, mostly by human eye, for their obvious external defects; e.g., chips, cracks, scratches, holes and pitting, lumps, spots, notches, and glazing. This task is often referred to as visual inspection which is important to categorize the final products into quality-constant batches. Prototypes are of invaluable help while inspecting the visual attributes of products. Visual quality of products is assessed with respect to these standard units and some quality ratings are made there on the results. However, assessing visual quality is somewhat an ambiguous and troublesome work. Therefore, it will be helpful to utilize a decision making technique, such as fuzzy logic, to facilitate and improve the process. This paper addresses first to the significance of visual inspection and assessment of visual quality of industrial products, and second, gives a unique application of visual quality assessment of vitreous china ceramic sanitary wares by using fuzzy logic method.}

The safety regulations “low-, and high-speed, and pedestrian impacts” along with new environmental restrictions “end-of-life vehicles” increased the complexity level of bumper system design. The new bumper design must be flexible enough to reduce the passenger and occupant injury and stay intact in low-speed impact besides being stiff enough to dissipate the kinetic energy in high-speed impact. The reinforcement beam plays a vital role in safety and it must be validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) and experimental tests before mass production. The careful design and analysis of bumper beam effective parameters can optimize the strength, reduce the weight, and increase the possibility of utilizing biodegradable and recyclable materials to reduce the environmental pollution. Developing the correct design and analysis procedures prevents design re-modification. On the other hand, analysis of the most effective parameters conducive to high bumper beam strength increases the efficiency of product development. Cross section, longitudinal curvature, fixing method, rib thickness, and strength are some of the significant design parameters in bumper beam production. This study critically reviews the related literature on bumper design to come up with the optimal bumper beam design process. It particularly focuses on the effective parameters in the design of bumper beam and their most suitable values or ranges of values. The results can help designers and researchers in performing functional analysis of the bumper beam determinant variables.}

To address this gap, this paper identifies an array of quality dimensions critical to 4.0 polymer industry and prioritizes them leveraging a vector based multi-criteria decision-making method named Best-Worst method (BWM). A real polymer film manufacturer located in the state of Mississippi is considered as testing ground, and relevant industry expert opinions are incorporated within the Best-Worst method MCDM framework. Results yield conformance to standards, performance, and durability as the critical dimensions for 4.0 polymer industry managers pursuing waste reduction and strategy-focused quality improvement. Appreciation of this framework may guide practitioners and decision-makers to discern the relative importance of critical quality dimensions and subsequently support developmental areas to overcome challenges, ultimately achieving higher quality polymer products.}

abstract = {In order to reduce risks of failure, industries use a methodology called Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in terms of the Risk Priority Number (RPN). The RPN number is a product of ordinal scale variables, severity (S), occurrence (O) and detection (D) and product of such ordinal variables is debatable. The three risk attributes (S, O, and D) are generally given equal weightage, but this assumption may not be suitable for real-world applications. Apart from severity, occurrence, and detection, the presence of other risk attributes may also influence the risk of failure and hence should be considered for achieving a holistic approach towards mitigating failure modes. This paper proposes a systematic approach for developing a standard equation for RPN measure, using the methodology of interval number based logistic regression. Instead of utilizing RPN in product form for each failure, this method is benefited from decisions based on probability of risk of failure, 'P' which is more realistic in practical applications. A case study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology in finding the risk of failure of high capacity submersible pumps in the power plant. The developed logistic regression model (logit model) using R software helped in generating the probability of risk of failure equation for predicting the failures. The model showed the correct classification rate to be 77.47%. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showed the logit-model to be 81.98% accurate with an optimal cut-off value of 0.56.}

Resilience plays a crucial role in building sustainable infrastructure, and developing a resilient port system is a priority in planning and developing MTS. This paper aims to develop measures to enhance port resilience that can cope with risks and uncertainties. A circular four-stage method is proposed to study port resilience. The major disturbances that are currently affecting ports are summarized and classified. Then, a port resilience assessment model using the Bayesian network is proposed, in which various resilience strategies are categorized into different metrics to assess resilience capabilities (i.e. readiness and response capacities). The model is constructed based on expert judgment and statistical analysis. The Shanghai Yangshan Deepwater Port in China is used as a case study. The results show that natural disasters are major disruptors plaguing ports. The overall resilience of automated terminals is higher than that of non-automated terminals. Strategies to enhance visibility, such as building real-time data management systems and data analysis programs, have the most significant impact on improving ports’ readiness. Strategies to enhance recovery such as facility restoration and technology restoration are the most important when improving ports’ response capability.}

Modularization can help to realize customization, increase in flexibility, reusability of service modules, and simplification of complex PES systems, etc. However, compared with tangible product, the modularization of product-extension service has rarely been dealt with, despite its potential benefits. More specifically, the question of how to identify service components and partition modules in the practical context is still an unexplored subject. Thus, this paper proposes a PES modularization approach based on modified service blueprint and fuzzy graph. The PES blueprint is firstly used to represent the whole PES scenario and identify all relevant service components. Then, fuzzy graph theory is utilized to module partition based on correlation analysis results of the service components. Finally, an exemplified modular design of compressor rotor service demonstrates the potential of the proposed method.}

The manufacturing industry faces cheap competition from neighboring countries (such as China and Southeast Asian countries). As industrial enterprises relocate their production facilities to China and Southeast Asian nations, they must think about how to restructure the industry. Industrial tourism has been adopted as a form of industrial transformation. In recent years, an increasing number of conventional industrial enterprises have begun to transform production-oriented manufacturing and production plants into tourism facilities. This trend not only promotes industrial transformation but also helps industrial operators rethink how to create corporate value through service innovation as well as to determine future development directions for the manufacturing industry. Thus, this study attempts to identify the driving force of service facilities based on industrial tourism views. This study can help industrial operators review their value-driving forces while also helping them to understand the critical success factors for industrial transformation and determine the appropriate tourism transformation strategy. Additionally, this study explores tourists' need for industrial tourism and integrates the tourists' preference for service innovation and service demands for industrial tourism. This study proposes the IOA-NRM (innovation opportunity analysis-Network Relation Map) approach, which combines the IOA technique and NRM technique. The service/function of EH (educational heritage) not only increases the product/service knowledge for customers but also strengthens their enterprise identification with educational heritage consciousness. Therefore, the service providers of industrial tourism can identify the service innovation strategies and conventional industrial enterprises to find new market value via the IOA-NRM approach.}

The results of the interviews suggest that consumers infer sustainability from the appearance of interiors in a number of different ways and that image boards can elicit a range of inferences.

Consistent with the study hypotheses, observations revealed that most students were highly engaged, but engagement was lower for students who were observed later in the semester and who had the most prior gaming experience. In addition, observed engagement was associated with better performance on an assessment of the skills being taught in the game. In contrast, none of these effects was evident for self-reported student engagement.

Key improvements are the integration of thermal energy storage and the reduction of the operating temperature of the gas turbine to 950°C. As a result the solar receiver can provide the necessary temperature for solar-only operation of the plant at design point - without using the auxiliary burner.Annual performance calculations and an economic analysis of four different plant concepts were performed. Those concepts were analyzed using innovative power block processes. In general,such systems offer reliable and dispatchable power with low specific CO2 emissions.A substantial decrease of CO2 emissions has been achieved all along the four variants compared to results of a previous project [1]. Compared to the defined reference molten salt solar tower the solar-hybrid gas turbine plants as of now yield higher plant efficiencies, but have a slightly lower potential for CO2 reduction. Among the SHGT plants the variants including a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (SHORCC and SHORCC-R) achieve the highest efficiencies but have significantly higher LCOE, caused by the high costs of the ORC components which are not yet commercially available in the requireddimensions. The solar-hybrid combined cycle plant (SHCC)and solar-hybrid gas turbine plant with quasi isothermal compression and recuperation (SHGT-ICR) perform best among the SHGT plants in terms of LCOE, and can be considered an interesting alternative to molten salt tower plants. Taking into account other factors, such as plant complexity and water consumption, an isothermal solar gas turbine plant shows the most potential advantages. However, theSHCC has the highest technological maturity and is a likely candidate for a future demonstration plant.}

abstract = {This study introduces a novel data-driven Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach for service risk management, leveraging textual analysis of customer complaints to identify and assess service failure risks. Unlike traditional FMEA methods that rely on expert opinions, our approach utilizes guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with prior knowledge to mine service failures, reflecting actual customer experiences. Additionally, a unique text analysis framework, utilizing sentiment polarity, mention frequency, and information entropy, objectively quantifies Severity (S), Occurrence (O), and Detection (D) values of service failure modes. Enhancing the model further, we introduce the Criteria Importance Through Inter Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) framework. This combination, replacing the traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) method, utilizes objective weights and evaluates risks against ideal and nadir scenarios, offering a more accurate and comprehensive risk assessment. Applied to the hotel service industry in New York City, our method demonstrates enhanced accuracy and reliability over other methods. This research contributes significantly to service quality improvement, providing a more objective, efficient, and customer-oriented risk assessment approach.}

abstract = {Nowadays, public transport is considered as an alternative to private vehicles to reduce environmental and social problems in developing countries. Hence, assuring a high passenger satisfaction level in the public transport system is an important task for municipalities and governments. However, passenger satisfaction evaluation of public transport is difficult as the opinions of passengers are vague and uncertain, and the number of involved passengers is large. In this article, we present a new method based on double hierarchy hesitant linguistic term sets (DHHLTSs) and alternative queuing method (AQM) for the passenger satisfaction evaluation of rail transit network under large group environment. First, the DHHLTSs are utilized to depict the uncertain satisfaction evaluation information given by passengers. Next, thek-means++ algorithm is modified to cluster the large group of passengers for satisfaction evaluation information aggregation. Then, the AQM is extended and used to acquire the passenger satisfaction ranking of rail transit lines. The practicability and rationality of the proposed passenger satisfaction evaluation method are illustrated via an application to the Shanghai rail transit network in China. The result shows that the new method provides more reliable and realistic results and introduces directions for further service quality improvement of public transport.}

abstract = {In the context of digital transformation, social digitalization platform (SDP) emerges and play an important and irreplaceable role in the whole industrial ecosystems. The main value creation purpose of SDP is to develop general technical service portfolios and customized solutions. For SDPs, platform service portfolio management (PSPM) is a really difficult problem. The decision must dynamically respond to the complex external environments of business requirement, technology evolution, and system innovation. The traditional experience-driven decision-making process confuses various factors together, and it is difficult to produce scientific decisions continuously and effectively. To help these platform-kind firms make wise decision, we put forward a novel and practical decision-making methodological framework for PSPM issues. Firstly, a general system architecture model, namely Business-Digitalization-System (BDS) model, is proposed based on system engineering, which helps platform service component identification more refined. Next, the PSPM problem is formalized and modelled as a causal relation graph-based intertwined system analysis procedure. A novel platform service portfolio evaluation method is developed to obtain the priority of the identified service alternatives. The approach can effectively handle the component system importance and its heterogeneous causal interdependencies simultaneously. Meanwhile, the combinatorial manipulation of subjective judgements and objective measure improves the reasonability and efficiency within a multi-stakeholder group. Finally, a case study in the constructive industry is presented and the results of method comparisons show the feasibility and advantages of the methodology.}

For better CDCE, this study further fuses with DVs and PVs in more complex situations, and puts forward an improved version of rough distance to redefined ideal solution (RD-RIS II) in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) scope to select the optimal concept. Different from old RD-RIS in previous study, RD-RIS II not only supports the ideal solution definition (ISD) processes for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria, and but more importantly, it utilizes more useful information (value, feature, number and impact) from DVs and PVs to redefine the new positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS). Through the rough distance calculation, the alternative which is close to PIS and far away from NIS is selected as the best one. Besides, the feasibility of RD-RIS II is validated via the application in real design evaluation example, and three empirical comparisons confirm that RD-RIS II makes more comprehensive decision than other MCDM-based evaluation methods, especially when the choices of customers and designers are conflicting, therefore it could provide more reasonable evaluation result which has better credibility and stability than others.}

With the purpose of exploring more efficient and effective approaches for the evaluation and analysis of the soundscape quality of urban parks, the quality assessment theories and methods that used in the areas of quality management and service industry are adopted in this study. A quality evaluation method for the soundscape is then proposed based on two well-known service quality measurement (SQM) models, Importance-Satisfaction (I-S) model and Improvement index (Ii) model. By simultaneously assessing both importance and satisfaction of soundscape elements in urban parks, this method can provide detailed and comprehensive information that can be used for guiding the soundscape design and improvement of urban parks. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a case study in Hong Kong. Based on the analysis of the data collected by questionnaire survey in this case study, the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated, and a practical decision-making strategy for soundscape quality improvement of urban parks is summarized. According to the authors’ best knowledge, this study is the first attempt to apply the SQM method of combining I-S model and Ii model to the soundscape study of urban park. The ideas and findings not only benefit the practical soundscape management, but also provide a valuable reference for the academic research of soundscape.}

abstract = {Purpose
The interrelationship between organizational learning (OL) and organizational culture (OC) is often assumed at an abstract theoretical level, but there is yet no systematization of scholarly knowledge allowing to conceptualize and understand its precise nature. In this article, we therefore ask “How can we, based on the insights from the dispersed research studying OC and OL, conceptualize the interrelationship between the two concepts?” Our purpose is to create an overview on the past development path and the current status of research interrelating OL and OC, to use it as basis for the conceptualization of this interrelationship and to identify avenues for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
This article utilized a systematic literature review methodology by combining bibliometric and content analysis using relevant articles identified from the Scopus database. A two-stage literature review research approach was employed: (1) Bibliometric analysis was used to identify 416 relevant contributions and to present a comprehensive contextual picture of the interrelations between OL and OC research by analyzing the 162 most relevant articles. (2) A subsequent qualitative content analysis of the 45 most relevant academic contributions detailed and solidified the insights.
Findings
We identify four weakly linked thematic clusters on the interrelationship of OC and OL. Based on that, our analysis confirms the theorized bidirectional relationship between OC and OL: OC acts as antecedent, driver and result of OL processes, and OL processes are constrained by and alter OC. We moreover develop three propositions that put knowledge at the center of scholarly attention for understanding this interrelationship in more depth and develop avenues for future research.
Practical implications
Our research has important implications for managers as it shows that mastering leadership challenges is central for the success of OL processes and OC change. We moreover specify the leadership challenges that relate to particular types of OL processes. Managers need to take this interrelationship into account when setting out for OL or OC change processes, and carefully reflect on whether or not the decided OL measures fit the given OC, and the other way round.
Originality/value
Our contribution to existing research is threefold: It first lies in analytically mapping out the research field, second in conceptualizing the interrelationship between OC and OL and third in identifying open research questions and topics.}

This study assessed public understanding of OA and how social and demographic factors influence the public’s concern for OA. The analysis was based on 311 questionnaires from full-time Alaska residents. The results showed that most Alaskans self-reported to have a basic awareness of OA, and subsequently were able to recognize that CO2 emissions related to human activity are the dominant driver of changing ocean conditions. However, there was a low recognition of how natural variability in the marine environment affects OA, and most respondents were not very confident in their understanding of OA-related science. Moreover, even though many communities in Alaska are reliant on commercial and subsistence fishing activities, the respondents had a low awareness of fisheries-related OA risk. Given the ongoing debate associated with climate change research, evaluating CO2 mitigation efforts through the perspective of OA could give individuals an unbiased way to assess the pros and cons of more intensive efforts to curb CO2 emissions. Furthermore, using OA communication to enhance the understanding of how natural variability influences OA around the state and the potential economic implications for Alaska fisheries would help residents and stakeholders make informed decisions when considering fisheries management plans, food security, and job diversity as OA intensifies. Solidifying the understanding that any reduction in pH and intensification of OA can have implications for marine species that are irreversible on human timescales will reinforce not only that OA is an immediate concern, but also the importance of taking action now.}

The increased use of this modality has prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop national guidelines that emphasize the need for patient monitoring to ensure patient safety. A policy was developed that incorporated continuous monitoring of patients and frequent documentation of physiological measures before, during, and after procedures. All procedures over a 2-month period in the outpatient (n = 19) and inpatient (n = 24) pediatric oncology units that required midazolam and fentanyl were retrospectively analyzed. A nonrandom sample of one third of the inpatient procedures (n = 8) was also observed to assess the dynamics of monitoring and recording. Procedures, including recovery time, lasted an average of 69 minutes, with longer recovery periods recorded for the outpatient unit. Nurses, particularly on the inpatient unit, were not always able to provide continuous monitoring through recovery because of the demands of other patient assignments. This study suggests that to realistically meet the needs of the patients and the institution's responsibility, the current guidelines may need to be reconsidered to allow more nursing discretion in patient monitoring and/or the nurse's patient care assignment must be more flexible to allow for changing demands.}

abstract = {Context
The current technology revolution has posed unexpected challenges for the software industry. In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP).
Method
First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers.
Results
The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC.
Conclusion
By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.}

abstract = {The paper refers to the domain of engineering design and introduces a method for obtaining an optimal instantiation process for the design parameters in a design problem by using extended, problem- and path-dependent search within the digraphs that these parameters form. Design parameters are considered as entities being interrelated via deterministic associative relationships and forming digraphs that accommodate declarative and procedural design knowledge. They participate in establishing formal metrics for the estimation of importance and design effort. Factors with values assigned by the designer(s) define the required effort for the instantiation of primary parameters. A method is presented and an algorithm is proposed for obtaining optimal instantiation lists. The algorithm uses extended problem- and path-dependent search within the parameter digraphs. Iteratively, in each step, the algorithm performs extended search in order to: (a) locate the optimal path, (b) instantiate its primary parameter and (c) propagate its value throughout design space. Thus information and knowledge of major importance is produced early in the design process with minimum instantiation effort. The design of a belt conveyor carrying unit loads is used as a case study for the suggested method. The proposed method can optimally guide the instantiation process. Violations of requirements, specifications and constraints for important parameters are promptly realized, modifiable primary parameters are easily located and, as a result, the necessity for changes to parameter interrelationships can be subsequently justified.}

Here, a great number of considerations have to be borne in mind, e.g., technical, functional, aesthetic or economic criteria. More recently, the increasing concerns on environmental aspects have added complexity to the process, known as ecodesign. In this respect, a framework to integrate the criteria provided by quantitative environmental indicators has been proposed on the basis of Fuzzy Preference Programming method features and fuzzy logic reasoning. As a result, an integrated Ecodesign Index (EcoInd) is obtained. This idea enables the decision making at process and product level taking into account different indicators at a time. The ecodesign of children's footwear was taken as case study and an ecodesign tool (decision support system) that included the estimation of environmental indicators and their integration was developed. Different models of shoes were analyzed to identify the most environmentally friendly design and to test the tool. In this case, the Ecological Footprint and two Environmental Risk Assessment indicators, namely Hazard Quotient and Cancer Risk, were selected as relevant environmental indicators and they were computed from data provided by a shoes manufacturer. Then, these indicators were integrated in the ecodesign tool and the EcoInd values were appraised for the children's footwear models analyzed. According to these figures, they were ranked as Red Leather>White Leather>White Synthetic>Pink Synthetic, from best to worst.}

A holistic view is needed in order to manage all criteria, considering as many perspectives and interests as possible. This paper presents a model that provides a common understanding for stakeholders involved, together with the requirements, functions and sub-systems of the product being developed. The model supports the decision making process, and supports the designer to balance the interests of different stakeholders and the related functions. This results in a product developed according to all known demands from various stakeholders. This, in turn, will enhance the possibility of success in the market.

We demonstrate the comparable performance of the PageRank algorithm to the ANP by comparing the results obtained from a previous conference paper that utilized the ANP for decision-making in sustainability-related problems involving water distribution systems feeding manufacturing industries. The ANP is commonly used for decision-making in complex systems, but has limitations such as subjective weighting and handling large datasets. In contrast, the PageRank algorithm, originally designed for web page ranking, offers a scalable and objective approach for analyzing complex systems. To showcase the effectiveness of the PageRank algorithm, we compare the results obtained from the ANP in our previous conference paper with the PageRank algorithm. Our findings reveal that the PageRank algorithm yields identical results to the ANP, while addressing its limitations. The results of this study demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the PageRank algorithm in achieving identical outcomes as the ANP, with potential advantages in scalability and objectivity. The proposed implementation of the PageRank algorithm as an alternative to the ANP offers a promising approach for prioritizing maintenance activities in water distribution systems, as similar considerations can be extended to any sector of activity.}

abstract = {Product developers understand the difficulties of trying to hit a moving target from atop a runaway train. Competitors come and go, technological change occurs at an ever-increasing rate, customer wants and needs are constantly shifting, and a product's life cycle may be shorter than its development time. We can't meet these challenges with a methodical, step-by-step approach to product development. In such a fast-paced environment, product development must be transformed into a continuous, iterative, learning process focused on customer value. G. David Hughes and Don C. Chafin describe one means for making this transformation: the value proposition process (VPP). The objectives of this development approach are continuous learning, identifying the certainty of knowledge used for decision-making, building consensus, and focusing on adding value. The VPP consists of a framework of continuous planning cycles, called the value proposition cycle (VPC), and an integrated screening methodology, called the value proposition readiness assessment (VPRA). The VPC comprises four iterative loops, addressing the following activities: Capturing the market value of the proposition (Does the customer care?); Developing the business value (Do we care?); Delivering a winning solution (Can we beat the competition?); and, Applying project and process planning (Can we do it?). Somewhat akin to stage-gate methods (but with the added dimension of continuous cycling), the VPRA involves screens along each loop in the VPC. This screening methodology summarizes the company's critical success factors, allowing the project team to assess the success potential of a new product idea. Each screen involves a structured set of questions. For each question, respondents provide three measures: their evaluation of that success factor's favorability to the company's position, the certainty of their evaluation, and their estimate of the relative importance of that success factor. Rather than building a model that computes a weighted-sum score for predicting the success of a new idea, the VPRA serves as a consensus facilitator, allowing team members to see how closely they agree. The certainty measures help the team identify knowledge gaps, and the importance measures help the team set priorities for successive iterations of the VPRA.}

To improve the design efficiency, reduce the design difficulty, and ensure the diversity of appearance design results, an interactive generative design technology based on mapping from features to parameters (IGDT-MFP) is proposed. The mouse was selected as the application object of this technology. Firstly, the local appearance features of the mouse were defined. Through Gray Relation Analysis (GRA), the correlation mechanism between local features and geometric parameters was established, which realized the design space's dimensionality reduction and the design's Simplification. Secondly, by improving the sampling method of the design space, the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method in the multi-parameter dimension, called LHSNM, was proposed, which can efficiently explore the design space and achieve the diversity of design solutions. Then the rule for interactive design was developed. By exploring the design space with a purposeful approach, the invalid sampling process was avoided, and the design efficiency was greatly improved. Lastly, an interactive design interface was built so that even non-professionals with no design experience can complete generative design of the diversity of mouse appearances and get a satisfactory solution. After testing and analysis, IGDT-MFP, as an interactive generative design method, shows high user-friendliness and design efficiency and can generate various satisfactory solutions for designers.}

What’s more, the criteria used by most of them are independent, which usually does not correspond with the real world. Although the analytic network process (ANP) has been proposed to deal with the problems above, several problems make the method impractical. This study first integrates the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and fuzzy soft set model for solving the supplier selection problem. This method not only considers the dependent and feedback effect among criteria, but also considers the uncertainties on decision making process. Finally, a case study of supplier selection considering risk factors is given to demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness.}

Petri Net (PN) tool is applied to represent the interactions among the working components of multi-robotic system. To enhance the relevance of the reliability study, triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are developed from the computed data, using possibility theory. The use of fuzzy arithmetic in the PN model increases the flexibility for application to various systems and conditions. Various reliability parameters, namely failure rate, repair time, MTBF, expected number of failures (ENOF), reliability and availability, are computed using FLTM. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed and the effects on system MTBF are addressed.

This paper addresses the issue of reliable and green routing in a road-rail multimodal transportation network. To enhance network reliability, types of disruptions occurring simultaneously in each node and arc are identified. Additionally, carbon emission is considered a risk caused by transportation process disruptions for achieving green routing. A combination of rating methods such as DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) and the Combined Compromise Solution (COCOSO), along with Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) Criticality reliability assignment method, is used to evaluate disruptions and select a safe route from origins to destinations. The DANP method produces a ranking of sub-criteria, and the COCOSO method produces a ranking of criteria in the network. The FMEA Criticality reliability assignment method is used to assign reliability to each option. Next, the route with the highest reliability from each origin to each destination is selected. The presented model investigates a cement road-rail transportation network in Iran. After analyzing the sensitivity of criteria and sub-criteria, the results provide best routes with increased reliability and reduced emissions risk.}

New levels of manufacturing precision are the key requirements to enable advanced machining processes that demands improved techniques of metrology with high flexibility, universality and high accuracy. New models for alternative configurations of future industrial organisations in general which are usually applied and especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) need to be investigated. Those new models can be developed on the basis of intelligent production technologies and integrated management systems as well as extensive use of the IT technologies, automation, robotics, parallel-processing computing and advanced engineering data exchange techniques.}

While there are some problems in the existing research, for example, the evaluation procedure is not standardized and is practically too complicated to operate. Therefore, there is a need to establish a new method to evaluate product maintainability. In the presented study, a concept and connotation of product maintainability combined with actual demand is proposed. Based on the theory of product life cycle, the evaluation index system of product maintainability and its calculation model are established considering its inherent attributes and external factors at the same time. The weight coefficient of each indicator can be calculated by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), then experts give scores for each indicator according to maintenance projects. Finally, the maintainability can be calculated. In the case study, the maintainability of the transmission is 0.778 through evaluation, and the maintainability can increase to 0.860 which belongs to the level of extremely high by improving some indicators. This is also in line with the evaluation results when it takes routine maintenance efforts and efficiency into consideration. The proposed method in this paper achieves good results and is beneficial to the standardization of the entire evaluation process.}

In this report, we describe the recruitment process and evaluated the effectiveness of various recruitment strategies utilized in our National Cancer Institute sponsored lung cancer chemoprevention study with celecoxib. Heavy ex-smokers were recruited into the study through various methods such as radio advertisements, print media, mass mailings, flyers, internet postings and others. The number of inquiries, on-site screenees and randomization generated by each method determined the efficacy of that recruitment strategy. We prescreened 4470 individuals, invited 323 people for on-site screening and randomized 137 subjects. Radio advertisements (ads) generated the most inquiries (71.1%), followed by internet posting (11.8%), print media (6.0%), posted and racked flyers (4.4%), mass mailings (2.7%) and other strategies such as referrals from friends or family members or health care providers (2.3%). Radio ads, although costly, yielded the most subjects for on-site screening and randomization. Moreover, among the various types of radio stations, news radio stations were by far the most successful. Our results suggest that advertising on news radio is a highly effective recruitment method for successful accrual of ex-smokers into lung cancer chemoprevention trials.}

The different properties of composite materials, namely compressive strength, flexural strength, density, abrasive wear, and water absorption were the criteria for ranking of the alternatives. The criteria have been weighted through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). To examine the consistency and robustness of the proposed integrated approach, various comparative and sensitivity analyses have been carried out. The correlation coefficients between the ranking results of the proposed and some other existing MCDM techniques have been computed to observe the statistical consistency. Empirical findings of the methods suggest 70 wt% of polypropylene, 15 wt% of rice husk ash and 15 wt. %of sand as the best composition for polymeric composite material as floor tile. The study validates that the MCDM techniques can be successfully applied for ranking of the alternatives and can enhance the materials selection process. The study will significantly help industrial managers involved in the selection process of polymeric composites.}

According to the model of Kano's, quality elements should be classified into three classes depending on their ability to create customer satisfaction or cause dissatisfaction: elements of expected quality, attractive quality, and one-dimensional quality. This study suggests that logistics customer service elements could be classified analogously with Kano's model to identify the most important customer service elements, and to effectively distinguish the differences between customer groups. Differences between traditional approaches and Kano's classification are discussed.}

As these networks are being transformed into next-generation networks, new and different services are being developed and mediated. However, little is known about the drivers of this development, and frameworks for strategic management of service innovation are scarce. This paper offers two contributions. First, it develops a conceptual framework for the identification and classification of drivers. This framework is derived from prevailing theories in organizational economics, strategic management, and marketing. Second, it presents, based on an analysis of contributions from 24 domain experts, which types of drivers for network service development receive the most attention by the experts. The analysis reveals that demand factors like customer values, service quality, and user readiness by far outnumber the supply factors as well as the general environmental factors, demonstrating the importance of the users for service development in this area. The results will assist service providers to identify drivers of a specific service offering and adjust the business model to these drivers.}

abstract = {The number of academic research considering improvements/applications in the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) field has been increasing in the literature day by day. Among these works, the most used MCDM method is undoubtedly the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Decomposed Fuzzy Sets (DFS) have been recently proposed to the literature in order to measure the inconsistency in expert judgments by providing optimistic and pessimistic point of view. The main objective of this paper is to extend AHP method by using DFS. DFS makes pairwise comparisons in AHP more reliable by considering the individual answers given by the decision makers to the reciprocal questions under vagueness and impreciseness. The proposed method, Decomposed Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (DF-AHP), is applied to determine the importance degrees of evaluation criteria in the pharmaceutical industry in order to illustrate the applicability of the approach. Based on the results, the “quality” is determined to be the most significant criterion in this industry. The results obtained from DF-AHP are compared with the results obtained from both traditional AHP and Pythagorean fuzzy AHP. The comparative analysis has also shown the most significant criterion is the same with the proposed method but slightly differences in the rank of the sub-criteria. The research can help businesses better understand the critical risks in the pharmaceutical industry.}

Remanufacturing is a process which allows decreasing and rationalising the quantities of materials used by recuperating parts of products at the end of the use phase, subjecting them to renewal treatments and then inserting them into new products, therefore prolonging their exploitation (over the long term). Remanufacturing is seen in literature as an end-of-life option for certain components/modules and this may give guidelines for some design improvements for a quick and easy disassembly. The approach developed in this work aims to integrate the potentials of remanufacturing as early as possible in the design process in order to reap the greatest benefits in both economic and environmental dimensions. This project includes a study of the designs of modular architecture, Reverse Supply Chain processes and also of the problem of dimensioning cycles for multiple use and upgrading possibilities (or functional enrichment). This article details the third study on upgrade cycles: it shows(1)the benefits of a method which simulates the upgrade cycles in terms of attractiveness and risk(2)the value of such a tool for guiding a more rigorous company strategy It illustrates also through an experiment conducted with an industrial leader in franking machines.

In this research, not only the commercial factors (price, quantity, and lead time), but also the environment factors (green factors and carbon dioxide emissions) of the suppliers are considered in order to reduce the harm to the environment (the carbon dioxide emissions and the use of the harmful materials). A product transportation distance is proposed for a product to record the transportation distance from the raw material to be a final product, and to be consumed by the consumers. It is used to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions during the whole processes of the product. An incentive mechanism is proposed to force the participants to make greener decisions to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions and use green materials. Numerical calculations are provided to verify the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed model.}

Building refurbishment is considered a practical pathway towards energy efficiency as the replacement of older buildings is at a slow pace. There are various ways of incorporating energy conservation measures in buildings through refurbishment projects. As such, we have to choose among various passive or active measures. In this study, we develop an integrated assessment model to direct energy management decisions in retrofit projects. Our focus will be on alternative passive measures that can be included in refurbishment projects to reduce overall energy consumption in buildings. We identify the relative priority of these alternatives with respect to their non-monetary (qualitative) benefits and issues using an analytic network process. Then, the above priorities will form a utility function that will be optimized along with the energy demand and retrofit costs using a multi-objective optimization model. We also explore various approaches to formulate the uncertainties that may arise in cost estimations and incorporate them into the optimization model. The applicability and authenticity of the proposed model is demonstrated through an illustrative case study application. The results reveal that the choice of the optimization approach for a retrofit project shall be done with respect to the extent of variations (uncertainties) in expected utilities (benefits) and costs for the alternative passive technologies.}

Using annual random sample household surveys conducted in fire-prone central Oregon from 2011 to 2013, this study examines the impact of wildfire events (i.e., wildfire exposure and evacuation), risk perception, wildfire plan informedness, proximity to wildlands, and various demographic factors on resident Firewise behavior participation. Findings indicate that residents who have experienced a wildfire event, who are familiar with their county’s Community Wildfire Protection Plan, who perceive wildfire risk to their community, and who live in proximity or within a wildland area, were significantly more likely to engage in Firewise behaviors than those residents without these experiences, orientations or household locations.}

These products continue their path with all kinds of sensors with different parts. Effective use of these technologies in the logistics industry can create a competitive advantage. Nowadays, there are many AVs, some of which are superior to others in terms of build quality, variety of features, and design. Choosing an efficient, optimal, and reliable vehicle is one of the most important challenges in logistics planning. Therefore, choosing an AV based on a series of criteria can be considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Due to the complication of decision-making issues, criteria are usually not independent of each other and there are relationships between them. Therefore, this study develop an extended MCDM framework based on Choquet integral (CI) under group decision-making with a Spherical fuzzy set (SFS) for assessing logistics AVs. The CI technique is expanded with SFS to increase the power of CI. Furthermore, the combination of CI with SFS leads to greater freedom for decision makers to express opinions and use three independent membership functions. Accordingly, the interactions between the criteria are considered and the skepticism and uncertainty present during the decision are controlled. The proposed approach is implemented in selecting the best AVs in the logistics industry, and the results are compared with Pythagorean fuzzy CI and Intuitionistic fuzzy CI. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is done by changing the weights and creating different scenarios to confirm and check the robustness of the proposed approach results. The results indicate the suggested approach's efficiency and the ranking's stability in different scenarios.}

By setting an organisation's competencies within the context of their customer or supplier interactions this paper supports the view posited by Ford et al. (1986) that interaction defines the value of assets and resources. In a study of collaboration in the UK auto industry, it was found that both operational and relational competences are critical factors in the performance of the new product development process. Thus, the ability of customers and suppliers to develop both structured and ad hoc processes of interaction is shown to be important to the development process from early supplier selection process.}

abstract = {At the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and many other engineering schools, the culminating experience prior to award of a degree is a capstone design experience. The desired outcomes for such a capstone design experience are very similar across engineering programs. Each program or discipline has freedom in how they achieve these outcomes, so long as it is a deliberate and traceable approach back to the desired outcomes. This freedom allows each discipline to tailor their capstone design experiences to those appropriate to their domains. When students are developed fully within a single discipline program that also offers their capstone, the structure promotes alignment of the student, instructor, and advisor expectations. However, as students are assigned outside of their core discipline to support other capstones, misunderstanding of how their unique skills support the capstone outcomes increases. The ability to then compare capstones beyond the top-level outcomes becomes difficult. This is the case for systems engineering (SE) majors at USAFA where they are allocated to other engineering capstones. In order to trace these distributed students’ capstones back to a common set of outcomes, a framework for understanding the full spectrum of their experiences is needed. This paper will review previous work in characterizing capstone experiences, present the method used to frame USAFA's capstones, and show a proposed a set of key characteristics and associated rubrics that will be used in future research.}

It has become more and more complicated due to increase in complexity, advanced features and facilities that are continuously being incorporated into the robots by different manufacturers. At present, different types of industrial robots with diverse capabilities, features, facilities and specifications are available in the market. Manufacturing environment, product design, production system and cost involved are some of the most influencing factors that directly affect the robot selection decision. The decision maker needs to identify and select the best suited robot in order to achieve the desired output with minimum cost and specific application ability. This paper attempts to solve the robot selection problem using two most appropriate multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and compares their relative performance for a given industrial application. The first MCDM approach is ‘VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje’ (VIKOR), a compromise ranking method and the other one is ‘ELimination and Et Choice Translating REality’ (ELECTRE), an outranking method. Two real time examples are cited in order to demonstrate and validate the applicability and potentiality of both these MCDM methods. It is observed that the relative rankings of the alternative robots as obtained using these two MCDM methods match quite well with those as derived by the past researchers.}

abstract = {The current COVID-19 virus pandemic has created massive disruptions in supply, demand, and production in global supply chains (SCs). The outbreak has revealed the deficiencies of non-resilient SCs. Business prosperity and continuity require internal resilience capabilities (IRCs) and resiliency to supply or demand fluctuations that create disruption risk situations. This paper develops a new methodology for diagnosing and improving the strength of a company’s internal resilience. The huge disruptions caused by COVID-19 are first presented and reviewed. Then, a thorough state-of-the-art analysis was conducted to define supply chain risk management and supply chain resilience, and then to align the substantial contributions of this research to the literature. These insights are followed by presenting and defining IRCs to highlight their role towards resilient business. This research hereby presents a new IRCs-PADRIC (Preparedness, Agility, Development, Recovery, Innovation and Collaboration) framework from which a company’s current resilience healthiness can be diagnosed as being either Healthy, Groaning or Dying. These diagnoses are associated with proposed actions to be taken accordingly. An integrated grey Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)/Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) approach is proposed to quantify the internal resiliency to enable a more accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, cause-effect analysis was performed to highlight the relationships among PADRIC. The developed IRCs-PADRIC methodology can be adopted by managers in any sector to diagnose their internal resiliency. This would help them to answer the following questions: What could have been internally developed to reduce and so react to the disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic? and how prepared would a company be for disruptions similar to COVID-19 in the future? The healthiness of IRCs of a pharmaceutical company was used to empirically validate the developed methodology. Theoretical and managerial implications were discussed, and future research avenues recommended based on research limitations.}

Shorter time to market requires the product development process (PDP) to change the way of working from the classical `wait and react’ to anticipating and preventing problems as early as possible in the development process. This requires a new, and different role for the quality and reliability tests used. While in a classical PDP products could be tested when available from (pilot) production, a modern, time-driven development process requires optimisation long before larger series of products are available. Accelerated stress testing (AST) is a classical solution for the implementation of tests where product failures need to be activated faster (and cheaper) in a well-controlled environment at the early stage of the PDP. This paper reviews the classical AST strategy and some most recent AST strategies. It demonstrates that these accelerated test strategies are mainly based on generic lists of failure mechanisms and have only very limited relation with the actual failure rate curve of products. The theoretical background of the four-phase roller coaster failure rate curve is addressed and from this an alternative AST strategy is developed based on the relevant phases of the roller coaster curve using a concept called stressor-susceptibility analysis. A discussion, on the application of the proposed AST strategies and their impacts on the four-phase roller-coaster curves, is given at the end.}

Thus, industrials are turning their attention to strategies for the management of products at the end-of-life. The remanufacturing is an end-of-life strategy that reduces the use of raw materials and saves energy while preserving the value added during the design and manufacturing processes. But, in most of the cases, remanufacturing processes must be adapted to existing products because products have not been designed to be remanufacturable. However, the process adaptations increase costs and this can lead the overall benefits obtained with the remanufacturing process to be reconsidered. The aim of our research was to propose an approach for the designers to integrate remanufacturing constraints throughout the design process; mainly in the earliest phases. The eco-methodology assists designers in two steps. They are first helped in improving the reliability of a remanufacturing end-of-life strategy for that product on the bases of the analysis of the project context. Then they are guided towards a product whose properties are adapted to remanufacturing. Our approach is built upon remanufacturable product profiles (RPP) encapsulating the knowledge on both remanufacturing contexts and remanufactured product properties. For the product profile definition, eight categories of design criteria were identified based on a survey of about 30 products successfully remanufactured. A statistical analysis was made to identify clusters of products. Then, product profiles were extracted while examining the links between internal and external criteria for each group. This methodology is supported by the tool REPRO2 (REmanufacturig with PROduct PROfiles) that we have developed, which should lead to a real integrated design of remanufacturable products. Indeed, designers assisted with this tool, made early design by product profiling. It gives specific information to improve the internal technical definition of the product under study from a remanufacturing point of view.}

This study sampled creeks representing forested, suburban, and urban watersheds along a longitudinal gradient for indicators of water quality, including traditional indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms and enterococci) and alternative viral indicators (male-specific and somatic coliphages). Tested microorganisms were generally distributed with highest concentrations in creek headwaters and in more developed watersheds. The headwaters also showed the strongest predictive relationship between indicator concentrations and urbanization as measured by impervious cover. A seasonal pattern was observed for indicator bacteria but not for indicator viruses. Coliphage typing indicated the likely source of contamination was nonhuman. Results suggest that headwater creeks can serve as sentinel habitat, signaling early warning of public health concerns from land-based anthropogenic activities. This study also implies the potential to eventually forecast indicator concentrations under land use change scenarios.}

Effective conservation and management of large species like marine mammals or sea turtles depend on knowledge of movement and habitat use.

In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the Eastern Banks of Moreton Bay in July–September 2012 and July 2013 and fitted with GPS and acoustic transmitters. Both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and movement data for individual dugongs. When the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was relatively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from GPS and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays. Acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs. However, the relative merits of the two technologies depend on the research question in the context of the species of interest, the location of the study and whether the study site has an established acoustic array.}

abstract = {Supplier selection is one of the biggest challenges facing manufacturing companies in an increasingly competitive environment. Selecting the right supplier can minimize the cost of raw materials, which constitute a large portion of the final production cost. During the past decade, attention has been drawn to the supplier selection problem, a complex process in which decision-makers assess multiple quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Approaches such as applied individual or hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods have also been developed to elucidate this problem. This research aims to offer a novel integrated MCDM method for the supplier selection problem based on the combination of Base Criterion (BC) and Utility Additive (UA) methods. In this approach, one of the criteria is selected as the base criterion. This criterion is compared with other criteria by considering the DM's preferences. The main contribution of this study is to present an integrated approach that simultaneously calculates the criteria weights and the rank of alternatives, leading to fewer pairwise comparisons and more consistency. Also, the robust mathematical foundation of the suggested model, which incorporates utility functions, assures that the results align with decision-maker preferences as much as possible. The Base Criterion Utility Additive (BCUA) model proposed in this paper, formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) model, is solved using the Lingo software package. A numerical example and a real case in the electronics industry have been presented to corroborate the applicability and effectiveness of the BCUA model. Sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis of the proposed method are discussed in comparison to already existing MCDM methods, including the Fully Consistency Method (FUCOM), Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA), Level Based Weight Assignment (LBWA), and Defining Interrelationships Between Ranked Criteria (DIBR). These analyses indicate that the criteria weights and alternative rankings are robust to changing the parameters δ and λ. In addition to selecting the most suitable supplier, the model presented here can also be used in any decision-making problem with multiple attributes and alternatives, particularly when decision-makers are faced with many alternatives.}

One of the direct activities, which has not been sufficiently investigated, relates to the locations for parking of freight vehicles with dangerous goods. In the territory of Serbia, where the research has been conducted, there are no prescribed locations of this type. Thus, in order to overcome that gap, a novel multi-criteria decision-making model based on Z numbers has been defined. The purpose of developing this model, which consists of fuzzy Pivot Pair-wise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment and fuzzy Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution methods and Z numbers, is to define a set of the required 28 locations that are most suitable for parking vehicles with dangerous goods out of a potential set of 92 locations. Fuzzy Pivot Pair-wise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment with Z numbers is defined for the first time in the literature and is used to determine weighting coefficients, while the Fuzzy Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution with Z numbers is applied for the ranking of locations. It is important to emphasize that a total of 12 evaluation models have been formed in order to segmentally determine suitable locations from the aspect of six highway sections. The results represent the selection of the most suitable locations in relation to the length of the observed sections and directions, so a final set of 28 locations was formed. Verification of the proposed model was carried out through sensitivity analysis, comparative analysis, and calculation of correlation coefficients. Further research involves the formation of different scenarios that will consist of several locations out of the 28 selected, taking into account the criterion of their least mutual distance. It is necessary to form scenarios for both directions of all highway sections, and make a decision recommending to competent institutions the exact number and locations for parking lots for vehicles with dangerous goods.}

The results shown that DDPD has vitality in the Intelligence Age by combining the cutting-edge digital technologies, such as AI, additive manufacturing, digital twin, and so on. Moreover, current DDPD studies could outperform the classical design methods on the well-defined tasks, but it still cannot master the creative/innovative design tasks which require the cognitive capability. This survey further highlights several future research potentials including cognitive intelligence-enabled design, end-to-end design integration, advanced design knowledge support, design for additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart product-service systems.

Very little research has addressed issues of recruitment and participation of lesbian and bisexual (LB) women, aged 40 and older, into research studies. This study is based on a larger cross-site intervention study that recruited women from five geographic regions in the United States for culturally specific LB healthy weight programs, lasting 12 or 16 weeks.
Methods
Principal investigators (PIs) of the five intervention programs completed a questionnaire on recruitment and participation strategies and barriers. Participant data on completion and sociodemographic variables were compiled and analyzed.
Results
The recruitment strategies the programs' PIs identified as most useful included word-of-mouth participant referrals, emails to LB participants' social networks, and use of electronic health records (at the two clinic-based programs) to identify eligible participants. Flyers and web postings were considered the least useful. Once in the program, participation and completion rates were fairly high (approximately 90%), although with varying levels of engagement in the different programs. Women who were younger or single were more likely to drop out. Women with disabilities had a lower participation/completion rate (82%) than women without any disability (93%). Dropouts were associated with challenges in scheduling (time of day, location) and changes in health status.
Conclusions
Implementation of key strategies can improve both recruitment and participation, but there is a great need for further study of best practices to recruit and promote participation of LB women for health intervention research.}

abstract = {E-commerce order fulfillment service (E-COFS) plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior in online marketplaces. The strategic outsourcing of the service allows e-commerce sellers to prioritize their core business areas, enhance customer satisfaction, and minimize fulfillment costs. However, a critical challenge lies in appraising the potential quality of E-COFS provided by third parties, especially when lacking historical information. To address this, this paper first designs a generalized framework for guiding the construction of the quantitative model for evaluating the potential quality of E-COFS. The proposed framework unfolds in three stages: (1) evaluating potential effectiveness of an E-COFS through quantifying stakeholders’ potential satisfaction from the E-COFS plan tailored by its provider, (2) evaluating its potential feasibility by quantifying the potential performance of the E-COFS quality management system (E-COFS-QMS) built by the provider on supporting the plan, and (3) integrating the above two parts to gauge the potential quality of the E-COFS. Building upon this framework, this paper then designs a novel quantitative model. Specifically, this model adopts the linguistic subjective judgment representation method and introduces basic uncertain linguistic information to achieve computing with words. Multiple stakeholders within e-commerce sellers are tasked with articulating their requirements, their preferences and expectations, and consensus reaching process is conducted to obtain the acceptable consensus among these stakeholders. Multiple experts from various domains are tasked with giving their subjective judgements on the performances of E-COFS and E-COFS-QMS, and a method of weighting individual judgments, which respects the reliabilities of individual judgements and the overall similarity in knowledge structures among the experts, is adopted to effectively tap into collective intelligence. Finally, a case study is conducted to validate the validity and feasibility of the proposed quantitative model.}

abstract = {A part is primarily characterized by its ‘function(s)’. The function of the part is achieved through its ‘interactions’ with other parts in an assembly under a set of operating conditions. These ‘interactions’ constitute the ‘behavior’ of the part. The ‘part behavior’ is achieved through a set of spatial and design functional relationships between the interacting surfaces of the parts. The set of spatial and design functional relationships for a part constitutes the Part Function Model (PFM) of that part. In this paper, the nature and role of part ‘functions’ and ‘behaviors’ have been studied in the context of a product design system. The paper addresses the following issues: (i) relationship between function, behavior, and geometry of a part; (ii) importance of ‘part behavior’ over ‘part function’, and development of a ‘part behavior’ model; (iii) methodology for transforming the part behaviors into the PFM model of the part; (iv) product model framework for storing the PFM model information with an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) based CAD system (Concentra's Concept Modeller); (v) importance of the PFM model within the product development process; and (vi) application of the PFM model for generating various product specifications of the part. The prototype implementation of a Functional Design System for transforming part behaviors into different types of part specifications has also been presented in this paper.}

abstract = {This research develops a humanitarian cold supply chain model with equity consideration for COVID-19 vaccine distribution during a pandemic, considering deprivation cost and an important social concept named equity. The proposed comprehensive plan minimizes all incurred costs, including transportation costs, shortage costs, deprivation costs, and holding costs, while aiming at eliminating infection and mortality rates. The proposed three-echelon supply chain model includes suppliers, distributors, and affected regions (ARs), as destinations. We apply the proposed model to the actual vaccine distribution data during the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed to minimize the costs and satisfy the demand goals in the vaccine distribution plan. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates how total and deprivation costs affect each other, helping the managers establish a trade-off between them. The results show that appropriate supply chain planning can minimize logistics and social costs. The proposed model can help policymakers, and decision-makers better understand the importance of equity and implement a fair distribution of vaccines, considering the deprivation cost as a social cost.}

In the era of non-human innovation intermediaries, we should begin to view NLP not only as a useful technology applied in different innovation practices but also as an intermediary orchestrating valuable information. Previous research has not taken this perspective, and knowledge about its intermediation activities and functions is limited. This study reviews 167 academic articles to better understand how NLP approaches can enrich intermediation in early-stage innovation search. It identifies 18 distinctive innovation practices taking over activities like forecasting trends, illustrating technology and idea landscapes, filtering out distinctive contributions, recombining domain-specific and analogous knowledge, or matching problems with solutions. While certain NLP capabilities complement each other, the analysis shows that the choice of the most appropriate approach depends on the characteristics of the innovation practice. Innovation researchers and practitioners should rethink current roles and responsibilities in AI-based innovation processes. As seen in the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), the rapidly evolving field offers many future research opportunities and practical benefits.}

Due to standards, legal regulation and customer growing awareness of environmental issues, engineers cannot avoid turning their everyday activities from design to eco-design. By the way, a significant drop of environmental impact of products cannot be achieved by simply adding a „green‟ constraint to the already overpopulated list of design constraints. To answer to this issue a plurality of methods are available helping the designer (or pretending to) to assess product lifecycle or to provide suggestions on how to innovate the product or process according to sustainable goals. Within this context, the present work describes a way of using TRIZ concepts and tools in order to both assess and innovate a technical system so that some practical activities to ensure sustainable results can be easily embodied into everyday design practice. The main novelty on the operative level consists of an original method based on a set of Guidelines derived from Laws of Technical System Evolution (LTSE) in order to assess the value of existing solution (e.g. using Resources and Functionality as a metric of evaluation), to understand the most promising directions of improvement and to improve said solution also according to sustainability requirements. The paper will show the way Guidelines are applied with practical examples and an industrial case study will be presented and discussed.}

Axiomatic design can effectively reduce product complexity, but there are deficiencies in the usage process and the innovation stimulation. This paper proposes a holistic method for the development of complex products by using a neural network-aided technological evolution process to control negative effects of complexity. For the first time, engineering parameters are used as the intermediary between the complexity and technological evolution. Problematic engineering parameters are extracted from a current reality tree model through a natural language process. An artificial neural network is trained to predict the technological evolution law based on existing successful samples. Appropriate analogical objects are formed in an invention principle case library through the similarity analysis of engineering parameters. The optimal scheme is developed objectively by using the coefficient variation method and Dempster combination rule. The proposed method is applied to develop a pipe cutting machine with a granted patent for its feasibility and effectiveness.}

While these lean tools are said to minimize delays and improve project delivery processes, most have been conceptualized to assess aspects of the lean tools. However, to ensure suitability and applicability, and thus, the success of lean tools implementation, there is the need for identification and appropriate prioritization of the lean tools. This paper proposes a novel delay control framework based on AHP method for the evaluation of lean tools application in the external environment (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental aspects) of construction projects. To extend the qualitative data, six main delay sources and forty lean tools were extracted from the existing literature for further empirical inquiry. The results of the framework indicated that the most effective lean tools were concurrent engineering, last planner system and daily huddle meetings with priorities 0.425235, 0.379652 and 0.371172 respectively. Meanwhile, the least influenced lean tool was found to be SMART Goals with priority 0.026566. This framework, would provide a decision tool for practitioners to determine appropriate lean tools to control specific delay sources.}

abstract = {The underlying assumption of a good supply chain is that buyers and suppliers are willing to accommodate the uncertainties and variations in each other's businesses. We define supply chain flexibility as the robustness of the buyer–supplier relationship under changing supply conditions. This flexibility provides an effective parameter for characterizing the behavior of asynchronous supply chains. A highly flexible relationship is one in which there is little deterioration in the procurement price under different supply conditions. In this paper we introduce a measure for estimating supply chain flexibility as a function of varying order quantities and varying supply lead-times. Our survey indicates that order quantities and supply lead-times are the two most common changes which occur in supply chains, and are most often the cause of buyer–supplier grievance. Since buyers are not always able to predict downstream conditions, they will often issue procurement orders that are for a smaller quantity than normal, and/or shorter supply lead-time than normal. In an inflexible relationship a supplier will only accept these orders at a much higher unit price. Using the proposed model a buyer is able to estimate the flexibility of potential supply chain partners, and hence make a quantifiable choice. The measure itself can be specified in the supply chain contract. Further, in conjunction with a parametric representation of the buyer's procurement behavior, the model is able to estimate the annual procurement cost of a given relationship.}

Many studies have thusly been conducted to design and develop the smart PSS, while i) how to identify multi-source requirements through reviewing the entire service interaction cycle, ii) how to define and deduce the innovative smart connected products (SCPs) features under contradictory interests, and iii) how to specify the functional and data service configuration solutions are still unclear. To tackle these problems, a knowledge-driven approach was introduced to better organize the multi-source design knowledge and deduce service recommendations for personalized user demands. Specifically, a user journey map-based method was proposed for knowledge elicitation of the specific user demands. To organize the user knowledge for better understanding, hierarchical personalized user requirements (PURs) analytics were proposed to quantitively transfer PURs into proper design engineering parameters. To inspire the problem-solving logic for design solution generation, TRIZ inventive principles were retrieved and referred to. With the generated design concept, the service logic diagrams were structured to define the personalized service content of SCPs. Having the service logic and SCPs, the overall service network of the user-centric smart PSS can be outlined. The proposed approach was demonstrated and validated in the digital health area via a case study on smart test tube rack (STTR) design, and it was validated from an economic feasibility perspective. It showed that the STTR was promising to reduce manual work, improve the nurses' performance, and enhance patients’ medical experience. Furthermore, it was suggested that the proposed approach can effectively guide the innovative SCPs creation in a straightforward and instructive manner, and is promising to process the service solution deduction and improve the efficiency of service creation in real practice.}

abstract = {In general, product development companies aim to deliver products of optimal quality while incurring minimal cost in the shortest time possible. In this work, a quality–time–cost-oriented strategy (QTCOS) is proposed to facilitate product concept generation and selection. Firstly, general sorting is employed to elicit an initial product platform. The platform, constructed with a design space framework (DSF), serves as a base for generating a preliminary range of design options. Using the repertory grids elicitation method, designers contribute importance ratings with respect to a set of time and cost criteria for the range of design options. To account for trade-offs between cost and time related concerns, these ratings are employed to reduce the number of the derived design options, and thereby used as input features to a restricted coulomb energy (RCE) neural network. The RCE network function is applied to classify the set of design options into different patterns, i.e. cost–time-pairs. The classification results can subsequently serve as bases for the selection of preferred design options. A case study on wood golf club design is conducted to illustrate the proposed QTCOS.}
