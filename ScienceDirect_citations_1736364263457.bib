abstract = {The nature of natural fibre such as it is lightweight, recyclable, biodegradable and gives a high performance in relation to its mechanical properties makes this material an excellent alternative to currently used materials in the manufacture of automotive components. The significant mechanical properties are identified using the best statistical model suggested by stepwise regression in this study. The estimation and error analysis of the response variables are discussed to select the best natural fibre for automotive component applications. The results using statistical measurement indicate that tensile strength is the most significant mechanical property for all the selected natural fibres. The final ranking that considered high performance score and minimum error analysis for a hand-brake lever application found that coir, kenaf and cotton are the top three candidates with average scores of 4, 4.5 and 5, respectively. The statistical model presented in this study can be used in multiple applications. In fact, this approach is helpful to the design engineer when huge amounts data are involved.}

For this purpose, the present paper investigates the problems of existing approaches in this area, and proposes a comprehensive DEA model which enables us to estimate the relative efficiency scores of real-life systems. The proposed model contains different types of imprecise data and general form of weight restrictions. A new simulation-based genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to estimate the expected values of relative efficiencies with the comprehensive DEA model. It is shown that the proposed model and the solution approach solves the drawbacks of existing models, and gives more informative and reliable results. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical content of the paper and to show the effectiveness of the new approach.}

abstract = {A usability evaluation was performed on four drywall sanding tools and redesign specifications were developed for one, to improve the human-tool interface of the sander that provides the greatest control of drywall dust, a known respiratory health hazard. Sixteen novice participants performed simulated drywall-finishing tasks with each of the four tools: block, ventilated, pole, and wet sponge sanders. Outcome measures of interest were four usability metrics: “ease of use”, “ease of learning”, “perceived productivity”, and “comfort”. Scaled questionnaire items were analyzed by MANOVA and responses to open-ended questions were analyzed via content analysis procedures. The block sander, the current industry standard tool, performed best in usability evaluations of “ease of learning” and “ease of use”. The ventilated sander, found to be most effective in dust control, performed poorly in terms of “ease of use” and “perceived comfort”, but well on “perceived productivity”. Findings from content analysis were employed in development of redesign recommendations. Redesign recommendations to improve comfort and ease are presented: reduce tool weight, reduce moment-arm, and improve grip design.
Relevance to industry
Ventilated sanding technology can substantially reduce worker exposure to drywall dust; however, usability problems might be preventing widespread adoption of this technology.}

This paper reviews and categorises 10 of the most common methods in this area, in terms of what their key features are, and what strengths, weaknesses and appropriateness are. We develop a classification scheme based on three performance dimensions with specific criteria: (1) stimuli used as cue for need elicitation, (2) task format, and (3) need actionability. We provide guidelines for the appropriateness of these methods in the new product development process based on the newness strategy of the development process (radical versus incremental innovation) and identify which functional department (marketing versus R&D) the method should primarily support.}

Although this can nowadays be handled in an appropriate manner for an individual component design, in terms of a holistically efficient lightweight design a further consideration of a combined and correctly chosen (constructive and technological) joint section design of two or more adjacent parts, and thus a more systemic view is indispensable, but until now mostly neglected. Therefore, and to overcome these hitherto untapped potentials in lightweight engineering, this contribution presents a detailed view on the multi-cross-dimensional, three-step embodiment design cycle of structurally loaded components and subassemblies inside an integrated lightweight and material-oriented development (LMOD) methodology framework.}

Firstly, we established an index system, involving the process of knowledge management, the organizational knowledge structure, economic benefits and efficiency. And based on this index system, a synthetic evaluation method is presented, using triangular fuzzy number to measure indexes and facilitating the KMPE with a group support system (GSS). To know better of the proposed method, we have an example to illustrate. Finally, the empirical study conducted in this paper indicates that the evaluation method has strong practicability and operability. Besides, the evaluation is enabled by using a group support system: the more objective scoring can be achieved due to synchronic/asynchronous and anonymous participation; Decision-makers improve their efficiency by the clear demonstration analysis results. The systematic method of KMPE based on the index system is able to improve organizations’ efficiency in performance evaluation process.}

abstract = {Quality products and competitively priced services are crucial in today’s global markets. To provide quality at an acceptable price, companies seek out not only raw material and product suppliers but also calibration services suppliers. The calibration of measurement devices is one of the ISO9001 standard requirements for quality. Although companies select and manage their calibration processes as economically as possible, cost is not their only selection criterion. Technical capability, documentation competence, performance history, warranties, and communications are also considered when selecting calibration suppliers. There are numerous criteria and methods in the current literature on supplier selection, but few studies have specifically examined the selection of calibration suppliers. This paper is the first study that specifically examines the selection process for calibration suppliers by utilizing selection criteria that were researched and presented prior to this study. Due to the varied linguistic expressions of criteria and the uncertain model parameters, this paper presents a fuzzy approach for selecting a calibration supplier. The model contains relevant calibration service quality parameters such as the weight of criteria, cost, calibration time, demand, technical capability, and number of experts. This study proposes a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming model that assigns the calibration supplier to the measurement device using two objectives: maximizing the fuzzy weight of the criteria and minimizing the fuzzy calibration cost through fuzzy calibration time, the number of certified experts, the technical capability of the company, and the measurement device demand. A two-phase approach is used to solve the fuzzy multi-objective decision model. Weight, cost, and calibration time are handled as fuzzy numbers for modelling the imprecise data. In an actual application, calibration suppliers are selected for 20 measurement device types and 161 measurement devices with the fuzzy multi-objective linear programming model.}

First, based on functional performance analysis, the relationship among main coupling operational factors including manufacturing machine, production task, and produced workpiece is expounded, and the connotation of the functional health state is defined. Second, three quantitative models of the coupling effect between operational factors are constructed. Third, an integrated functional health prognosis model for the manufacturing system is established.

Quality is, however, a complex concept, and experts recommend identifying relevant product quality characteristics to satisfy users/customers’ needs. There is thus a need to understand how SPI initiatives contribute to the improvement of software product quality characteristics. This paper aims to provide an overview of an up-to-date state-of-the-art regarding initiatives that focus on promoting product quality improvement by applying SPI approaches. This goal was achieved by conducting a systematic mapping study, as a result of which we identified 74 primary papers including both theoretical (75.7%) and empirical (24.3%) papers. The main product quality characteristics addressed are security, usability and reliability. Security-related process models, on the other hand, are those most cited (53%). The empirical papers suggest that traditional process reference models, such as CMM, CMMI or ISO 9001, moderately increase product quality characteristics, these principally being maintainability and reliability. However, there is a need for more empirical research to evaluate the impact of SPI initiatives on software product quality by considering contextual factors. SPI initiatives should be more driven by performance goals related to product quality characteristics.}

The difficulty arises from the complex, iterative, and uncertain nature of building design and the challenges of integration with well-posed energy assessment tools. The purpose of this article is to first review characteristics of performance-based design and establish requirements for a methodology that includes generating promising design alternatives, assessing the energy performance in tandem with the generation of alternatives, and choosing an alternative design solution with confidence. The study then proposes a novel systematic data-driven method, based on linear inverse modeling that generates plausible ranges for design parameters given a preferred energy target. The energy performance in this method is described as a linear function of the design parameters for a particular scenario of design. The application of the proposed method in a case study shows that it is capable of helping designers make informed decisions regarding energy performance iteratively and confidently at the early stages of building design.}

In his analysis of fourteen development projects, Philipp Murmann reports that managers expect a reduction of development time as well as of development resources by 30% if appropriate activities would be employed. Parallel tasking and efficiency improvements account for the potential savings. Paralleling effects are project related, while improvements external to the projects cause efficiency-effects. Ten identified internal and external activities were expected to be of major importance in the reduction of development times. Major improvements are found among activities concentrated at the front end of development process. Further analyses show that primary and secondary activities can be separated; however, all of these activities need to be activated in order to achieve the anticipated results.}

Today, the economical context leads manufacturing firms to consider priorities managed by service providers and external elements coming from the customers. Moreover, manufacturers are obliged to consider products and services deliveries as a mixed activity. To respond to these problematics, we propose to use enterprise modeling methods to define the bases of a reference model of a mixed enterprise able to propose products and product services paying attention to specific management functions to ensure customer satisfaction.}

Such a project deals with the distribution of mortar to perform activities that use it. Since IPD is a strategy that encompasses several factors and agents, whose primary aim is to maximize the total quality of a product, all lifecycle of a product development aims to minimize risks of security, of use, economics, and markets. Implementing the IPD in buildings is complex, and many times during the development process, there is necessary to develop tools and artifacts to improve the process itself. The IPD diagnosed the distribution of the mortar as a critical task in the building process. Here is presented one solution adopted by the IPD design team to improve the transportation logistics of mortar, according to the product of lifecycle management (PLM) in the production of buildings. The device created following the same criteria of the global project in its development since it should meet the product IPD and meet the specific criteria of its future production. Then, by applying finite element analysis, throughout its development, it was possible to reduce the amount of welding, cut plates, and estimated time for its production. Forward, the design PLM was satisfactorily fulfilled for the device, and the global project, once it completes the design of the device, the integrated development of the production and distribution of the mortar was realized.}

This paper proposes the use of Kano’s model in this process to analyse the impact of different subjective attributes on consumers’ purchase decisions. A practical example of real estate promotions design is presented. In the first stage, semantic differential is used to measure the subjective component of the emotional state. In the second stage, regression analysis and Kano’s model are used to define the relative weight of each emotional attribute in the purchase decision. Besides linear attributes, Kano’s model identified two other kinds of attributes that present a non-linear performance: basic attributes and exciting attributes. Therefore linear models could underestimate the effect of such kind of attributes.
Relevance to industry
This information is very relevant for architects and designers as it enables them to determine the extent to which they must direct their efforts at improving certain attributes with the object of improving the global evaluation.}

abstract = {Summary
Driven by the global environmental movement and consumer p15, preferences to ‘green labeled products’, a new paradigm has emerged: {‘GREEN’ ROBUST PRODUCTS) plus {CLEAN PRODUCTION} equals {SUSTAINABLE GROWTH). This paradigm evolved from the growing environmental regulations and occupational health and safety laws that restrict gaseous, liquid, and solid emissions and waste disposals from manufacturing processes and products in-use and -disposal. Also, disposal of product packaging and recycling of used products is forcing the rethinking of the entire product life cycle from product strategy to recycling/disposal. There is a growing recognition of the fact that the competitive position and, indeed, the very survival of companies depend on their response to this paradigm. This new paradigm is named the paradigm ‘E’ because to adopt it, a corporation must emphasize Ecology, Environment, Energy, Economy, Empowering, Education, and Excellence in all product life cycle decision. Responding to this paradigm poses several new challenges beyond the traditional role and expertise of most product designers and production engineers. In this paper, the evolving issues of the paradigm and their impact on product design and production are examined. The steps necessary for the adoption of the Paradigm ‘E’ are presented. A review is presented of the available methodologies and analysis tools for making evaluation of environmental impact, product life cycle economics, and corporate competitive positioning. Activity modeling which provides a comprehensive methodology for these investigations is illustrated through sample outputs from an on-going industrial implementation of the Paradigm ‘E’.}

This problem can be solved by transition from sequential engineering to concurrent engineering, (Concurrent Engineering Fundamentals, Integrated Product and Process Organization, Vol. I, Prentice Hall PTR, New Jersey, 1996; Concurr. Eng. Res. Appl. 9 (2001) 191). The article presents the principle of concurrent product development process. The market forces small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to a transition from sequential to concurrent engineering and as team work is the basic element of the concurrent engineering, special attention is being paid to team and workgroup forming in the loops of concurrent product development process in an SME. The article does not deal with communication issues within a team and among teams. A survey of published works in the field of designing teams in big companies has revealed that in big companies a three-level team structure is recommended, as well as a workgroup, consisting of four basic teams. Analysis of the three-level team structure has led us to the conclusion that in SMEs a two-level team structure and a workgroup consisting of two basic teams should be preferred. The results of designing a two-level team structure and the project of transition to concurrent development of mini-loader are presented. Time and cost analysis results prove the justification of transition from sequential to concurrent product development.}

The survey included approximately 20 questions relating to the length of time individuals had lived in the high demand areas in each county, and also relating to weekly and annual mobility patterns. Lifetime inhalation exposures to 1,3-D are determined, in part, by the number of years individuals spend in an area where the fumigant is used. The purpose of the survey was to provide location-specific data for probabilistic modeling of long-term inhalation exposures to 1,3-D. The survey found that the majority of residents do not live in a high demand area or in the same house (99.99%) for 70years (a default assumption used by some regulatory agencies). It was also observed that residents move frequently and are mobile day-to-day and week-to-week, within the use area. Finally, estimates of total residency duration, derived from the survey results indicate that median times spent within a high demand area (which could include more than one residential location) were 18 and 26years for Ventura and Merced high demand areas, respectively. The average time spent in the high demand areas was 22 and 27years for the Ventura and Merced community, respectively. Less than 0.01% of the populations in either of the high demand areas spend 70years in the same house.}

abstract = {Recently, fisheries managers have been faced with high uncertainty about Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) stock status, especially due to the lack of fishery-dependent data since the harvest moratorium in 1990. Regardless of this uncertainty, the angling community has been pressuring fishery managers to open the goliath grouper to recreational take, while the diving community has been pressuring managers to keep the fishery closed due to the touted ecotourism value of the spawning aggregations. A previous study estimated that resident anglers in Florida who wanted the fishery open were willing to pay between US$34 and US$79 to harvest a goliath grouper. Using a survey instrument with choice experiments, the present study estimated that divers (n = 1537) off eastern Florida would be willing to pay approximately US$103 for a dive trip with one goliath grouper encounter during the months of their spawning aggregation (August–October), and US$202 if there are 40 goliath grouper (such as is common on a many spawning aggregation sites). Results suggested that divers coming from outside of Florida were willing to pay higher rates for dive trips with goliath grouper encounters; and at spawning aggregations sites, willingness to pay was estimated around US$336 for these non-Florida divers. Based on life-history traits of goliath grouper and the high value of their spawning aggregation sites, we suggest any changes in goliath grouper policy that would negatively impact spawning aggregation numbers be made with caution.}

The approach integrates the product modularization-driven postponement and flexible supply chain structuring downstream the order penetration point. The findings suggest that the integrated modularization and customer-oriented dynamical supply chain structuring are significant drivers of the supply chain agility. The elaborated conceptual framework provides deeper insights into supply chain modularization and agility from coordination and customer-oriented collaboration prospects. The concept is supported by mathematical models and information systems. It is the first in the literature that reports an approach of integrated product-process driven modularizing and structuring supply chains considering their inbound and outbound integrity in the immediate value adding processes.}

Competitiveness and the cost of products determine the lifeline of an organisation. The traditional machine tools such as the dedicated and flexible machines are designed on the principle of machine design. The development of reconfigurable machines seeks a new approach to design that not only encompasses the existing approaches but should include new design approaches as well. The success of a designed product maybe measured by the capability of the system that produces it. It is critical when designing a product that the organisation’s technological and manufacturing system capabilities be considered as failure to do so may lead to production designs that are not manufacturable. A good design system ensures quick delivery of a quality, reliable and safe product. This research therefore seeks to develop an integrated approach to design that incorporates design for manufacturing, design for assembly, concurrent engineering, eco-design and reconfigurable design as critical components for reconfigurable machine tool. Literature on these systems was reviewed to integrate the different design paradigms. The results of the study give a new approach to a reconfigurable machine design based on the integration of the five design approaches and their impact in the life cycle of a product.}

This research stratifies the plithogenic multi criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy for defining the significant weights of assessing standards, and the VIKOR technique is applied for enhancing the serving efficiency classifications of the possible substitutes. An experimental issue, including 11 assessing standards, 3 private and 2 general hospitals in Zagazig, has been evaluated by 3 assessors from several areas of medical activities, asked to validate the suggested strategy. In this research, we give some definitions of the plithogenic environment, which is more general and comprehensive than fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic ones. The plithogeny is interested in the contradiction degrees between attribute values that help in better calculating the aggregations. We conducted the data analysis and the results showed us that the serving efficiency of private medical centers is superior than that of general medical centers due to the fact that public medical centers are scarcely supported by governmental institutions. The private medical centers have to ward themselves to keep possession of bringing patients or attract patients. We conducted the sensitivity analysis of the achieved results, to verify their validity, and to find out to what extent the different values affect the ranking of available alternatives.}

The choice of supplier is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) to obtain the optimal decision based on a group of criteria. The health care sector faces several types of problems, and one of the most important is selecting an appropriate supplier that fits the desired performance level. The development of service/product quality in health care facilities in a country will improve the quality of the life of its population. This paper proposes an integrated multi-attribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) based on the best-worst method (BWM), plithogenic set, and rough numbers. BWM is applied to regulate the weight vector of the measures in group decision-making problems with a high level of consistency. For the treatment of uncertainty, a plithogenic set and rough number (RN) are used to improve the accuracy of results. Plithogenic set operations are used to deal with information in the desired manner that handles uncertainty and vagueness. Then, based on the plithogenic aggregation and the results of BWM evaluation, we use MABAC to find the optimal alternative according to defined criteria. To examine the proposed integrated algorithm, an empirical example is produced to select an optimal supplier within five options in the healthcare industry.}

Based on our own works in the last decade, we will discuss in this article how strong static as well as oscillating, strong magnetic fields on atoms and molecules affect electron density and chemical bonds. The dynamic fields generate completely new, hitherto unknown exciting phenomena. Our discussions will be based on three inter-linked, fundamental aspects of matter-external-magnetic-field interactions, viz., (1) action of static, strong magnetic fields as well as associated changes in electronic structure and the chemical bond, (2) Dynamics of electron density, and (3) Non-linear effects inherent in these interactions. Each aspect, although discussed separately for clarity, is a part of a larger intertwining picture.}

At the same time, there exists a large amount of customer comments in online reviews that is easily accessible, whilst the advances of data science, for example as part of Lean Automation, provide new means to extract information from this data. In this context, a new approach to fine-grained sentiment analysis of Chinese consumer data is developed. The new approach integrates pre-training language model, conditional random field model and linguistic knowledge model. The new approach is shown to outperform traditional approaches in a comparison experiment, while an ablation experiment shows that our new approach is parsimonious, i.e., all three constituting components are needed. Finally, a use case is presented that exemplifies how our new approach can support managers in identifying customer value (through positive evaluations), and most importantly guide Lean improvement, through detailed information on characteristics that are evaluated negatively, ranked according to customer importance.

abstract = {We calculated an Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA) at a regional scale. EFA captures the human impact on the environmental system by identifying the amount of biologically productive land necessary to support a person’s level of consumption and waste generation. EFA is a commonly used metric of sustainability because it is easy to conceptualize and the calculation is relatively straightforward. Utilizing free, readily available data, we calculated an EFA for a region in southern Colorado. Gathering existing data at a regional scale is difficult because data are often collected at national or state levels. The lack of data is further confounded by the fact that data are often collected at intervals greater than one year. Variables that were missing data for certain years were estimated using linear interpolation. Data not available by county were scaled to the region from state or national level data. Thirty-five variables from 1980 to 2005 (26 years) were collected and used to calculate a time-dependent EFA and the resulting trend was visually examined. The available biocapacity in the region did not decrease during the period, but per capita biocapacity decreased due to population growth. Per capita biocapacity was at a period high of nearly 41 ha per person (ha/ca) in 1980 and steadily decreased to a low around 31 ha/ca in 2005. Ecological footprint remained constant over the 26-year period, varying from a low of 5.1 ha/ca in 1997 to a high of 5.5 ha/ca in 1985. A steady ecological footprint combined with a decreasing per capita biocapacity, implies the ecological reserve is decreasing and, thus, the region is moving away from sustainability. Although per capita consumption did not increase substantially during the 26 years, more people are drawing on a fixed quantity of resources. Our methodology is a simplified approach to EFA and does not follow standards that are currently being established. Adhering to the suggested standards would require obtaining data sets that consist entirely of national data. The national level data are replaced with data specific to the geographic area under examination when they are available. Although national data may represent the sub-national region under study, that substitution requires further investigation, especially in large, geographically and culturally varied nations such as the US. Nevertheless, this simplified methodology provides enough detail that stakeholders can identify areas of the system on which to focus attention to improve sustainability of the system.}

abstract = {Product development and manufacturing continues to be a profound contributor to the socio-ecological problems and challenges we are facing in our world today. For products to contribute to sustainability requires not only that socio-ecological lifecycle impacts are considered in the initial stages of the product innovation process, but that they are maintained as integral product requirements. Although research offers a plethora of approaches, methods, and tools for sustainable product development, the implementation in industry remains low. The focus of this research is a less explored area of sustainable product development implementation, the management of needs identification and propagation of design requirements. The purpose is to: i) add to state of knowledge about current practices of sustainability integration into requirements, and ii) the academic discussion on implementation of sustainable design and product development. A self-assessment approach for sustainability integration into requirements is tested. The purpose of the approach is to support improvement of the requirements management process design, including activities and competencies, for engineering design. Four Swedish product development and manufacturing companies tested the approach, from which the results are used to evaluate usefulness, usability, and effect potential. The findings are discussed together with key characteristics for requirements and sustainability criteria, providing insights to ensure that socio-ecological considerations are both influencing the initial requirement specification, and maintained as decision parameters throughout the product development process.}

While ChatGPT is typically employed for tasks involving general knowledge, researchers increasingly explore the potential of this LLM-based tool in specific domains to enhance productivity. This study aims to compare the performance of a finetuned BERT model with that of ChatGPT on a domain-specific dataset in the context of developing an intelligent design support system. Through experiments conducted on classification and generation tasks, the knowledge transfer and elicitation abilities of ChatGPT are examined and contrasted with those of the finetuned BERT model. The findings indicate that ChatGPT exhibits comparable performance to the finetuned BERT model in sentence-level classification tasks but struggles with short sequences. However, ChatGPT's classification performance significantly improves when a few-shot setting is applied. Moreover, it can filter out unrelated data and enhance dataset quality by assimilating the underlying domain knowledge. Regarding content generation, ChatGPT with a zero-shot setting produces informative and readable output for domain-specific questions, albeit with an excessive amount of unrelated information, which can burden readers. In conclusion, ChatGPT demonstrates a promising potential for application in facilitating data labeling, knowledge transfer, and knowledge elicitation tasks. With minimal guidance, ChatGPT can substantially enhance the efficiency of domain experts in accomplishing their objectives. The findings suggest a nuanced integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with human expertise, bridging the gap from mere classification models to sophisticated human-analogous text generation systems. This signals a future in AI-augmented engineering design where the robust capabilities of AI technologies integrate with human creativity and innovation, creating a dynamic interactions to redefine how we tackle design challenges.}

It is also crucial to achieve the decarbonisation goals set by the EU's Energy Roadmap 2050. The EASEE research project, funded by the European Commission, addressed this issue by developing a holistic approach to envelope retrofitting. This paper presents an innovative technical solution developed within this research project: a lightweight, aerogel-based wallpaper that can be easily installed on the inner side of perimeter walls. The system is composed of an aerogel-impregnated textile layer, forming the insulating core, and a fabric finishing that can be easily installed and replaced thanks to a bespoke tensioning device. The development of the system is explained starting from the identification of the challenges related to the application of an insulating layer to the internal face of an existing wall. These include building physics, as well as operational aspects to reduce disturbances of users. The insulating layer, based on a textile mat impregnated with aerogel, was tested and characterised at laboratory scale to ensure its high thermal performances and its permeability to water vapour. The fabric finishing system was also designed to provide the possibility of easy tensioning and disassembly for cleaning or replacement. An innovative device, based on plastic zips, was developed and patented within the project. As part of the process, specific studies were developed about cold bridges, thermal capacity and environmental impact of the system. The wallpaper was finally tested and monitored to assess its in-situ thermal performance and the assembly procedure on a building at Politecnico di Milano.}

However, safety concerns in urban underground commercial buildings have become a major issue due to frequent accidents. Ensuring safe evacuation in densely populated underground commercial buildings is crucial. This study focuses on the safe evacuation of an urban underground commercial street A in Fuzhou City. A simulation framework based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) is proposed, integrating the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and BIM. The framework overcomes limitations in fire dynamic simulators. Using a BIM model, the study analyzes the risk of each fire protection area and selects the most unfavorable area for simulation. PyroSim technology is employed to study the entire fire development process in the underground commercial street under three different fire scenarios. The analysis includes evacuation stair travel time and personnel available safe evacuation time (TASET). By comparing the results, the study optimizes building layout design and identifies factors affecting personnel evacuation efficiency. The simulation outcomes aim to minimize casualties and property losses, contributing to fire safety management in urban underground commercial streets.}

Knowledge graphs (KGs), as the latest achievement in symbolic studies, are widely used in various fields due to their rich semantic expressive abilities. However, existing methods that mine resource description framework (RDF) triples in classical KGs cannot effectively capture the fuzzy semantic information in the product development system. To address this, we propose a multicriteria requirement ranking method based on uncertain knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR). First, we defined a model for representing uncertain knowledge to organize diverse data from multiple sources. This process was accomplished by constructing the requirement ontology, which is based on the function-behaviour-structure (FBS) model and requirements modelling-related documents. Next, a knowledge representation approach named the fuzzy requirement knowledge graph (FRKG) was devised by combining attribute confidence and predicate fuzziness. Then, knowledge reasoning rules were designed to enhance the edges in the FRKG, unveiling potential relationships between nodes. Utilizing the enriched FRKG (EFRKG), we proposed a multicriteria requirement ranking method based on grey relational analysis (GRA). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conducted a case study involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, the semantic extension capability of FRKG was evaluated, and a comparison with traditional multicriteria requirement ranking methods was performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach from both perspectives.}

abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on user requirement modeling based on online review texts. However, traditional methods often overlook the integration of user requirement models with product design frameworks, failing to effectively transform dynamically changing user requirements into a basis for product attribute upgrades. This paper proposes a user requirement modeling and evolutionary analysis method based on review data, supporting the design upgrade of product attributes. This approach differs from traditional user requirement modeling and analysis methods in two main aspects: (1) integrating the designer’s product design framework into the classification and modeling of user requirements; (2) analyzing the dynamic changes in user requirements during product upgrades and formulating new product attribute upgrade strategies. Initially, the study extracts three categories of product attributes that designers are concerned about from the review data: function (F), structure (S), and parameters (P), and establishes a correlation model between these product attributes. Subsequently, using natural language processing technology to calculate sentiment scores for product attributes and employing the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to analyze the impact of product attribute sentiment on user satisfaction, the study constructs the FSP-Kano model, achieving classification and modeling of user requirements for these three categories of product attributes. Finally, based on the dynamic changes in user requirements within the FSP-Kano model, strategies for upgrading next-generation products are formulated. Additionally, the study illustrates the proposed method with the example of BYD’s “Qin” series of new energy vehicles. Our research demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately and comprehensively extract user requirements and develop successful product attribute improvement strategies for the next generation of products.}

The weathering of sulfide bearing waste materials commonly generates acidity and dissolved metals in the environment creating acid mine drainage (AMD). Typically, the chosen reclamation solutions emphasize low construction costs over environmental and technical sustainability challenging decision making. The aim of this work was to develop a framework for analysis of alternative cover scenarios with multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) applied for the purpose. The case study comprised totally 10 criteria and five different cover structure options: moraine-based cover, biofuel fly ash/steel slag cover, stabilization with ordinary Portland cement or with composite binder, and use of an advanced hardpan cover liner (AHCL) system. The proposed methodological approach provides the structural steps of MCDA process to compare and contextually evaluate the economic, technical and social-ecological implications of cover alternatives. Modified Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied as a MCDA approach for structuring complex problems and assisting decision makers to choose the best alternative among a discrete set of scenarios. Differing preferences of the stakeholders were resolved by synthetizing the conflicting weightings in the beginning of the analysis. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the social-ecological impacts of emissions, energy demand and impact to human health. Overall, the results from this study show that when considering total sustainability, the AHCL was preferred over the other alternatives when the weighting of the main technical, social-ecological and economic criteria was equal (33%). The weighting of main criteria and consequently sub-criteria impacts the ranking order of compared solutions. Decision making comprising viewpoints of different stakeholders is important when evaluating sustainability criteria. Higher weighting of social-ecological and technical criteria (50%) favored stabilization with composite binder while higher weighting (50%) of costs favored moraine cover. The proposed framework can process competing and conflicting objectives in addition to quantitative and qualitative criteria, hence providing a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to complex problems. The results from this project can help to develop sustainable remediation strategies to reduce the environmental risks associated with mine wastes.}

NPD is acknowledged as the central function of businesses in an increasingly competitive marketplace. In the current era, the highly uncertain and rapidly changing market environment makes the NPD extremely vague and complex. To be able to find a suitable solution to this complexity, the proposed research aims to categorize the decision points in the process of NPD regarding software development and identify the fuzziness elements affecting the process. The goal of a decision-making process is to prioritize several alternatives with respect to some required objectives and to select the best among them. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) may support reaching a consensus judgment with the collective assessment of Decision Makers (DMs). We introduce a novel evaluation approach for this problem. The proposed approach employs a MULTIMOORA (Multi-objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis plus the Full Multiplicative Form) MCDM technique under Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) objective world environment to cope with an ambiguous environment using Group Decision Making (GDM) setting to shape the decisions. The PFSs have demonstrated their advantages in dealing with vagueness and uncertainty over crisp, fuzzy, or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Therefore, PFSs can represent the DMs’ judgments and preferences in a better structure, ensuring enhanced decision-making in a group consensus. A case study on gaming software and app development is presented to validate the functionality of the proposed method. The results are compared and assessed with the help of a sensitivity analysis. This research makes a real contribution to the literature by proposing a novel evaluation method to rate and select NPD (gaming software and apps) to deal with the inexactness and vagueness associated with the criteria and alternatives.}

This paper investigates whether a greater uptake in modern methods of construction (MMC) could help us achieve these targets. Key insights and findings from the existing literature on MMCs cost, time, greenhouse gas emissions and trade factors were analysed with strong indications of MMCs benefit to the targets. By using snowball sampling a quantitative survey was conducted on 134 professional working in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction sectors of UK with 23 questions on the four key targets. Cronbach’s Alpha and Pearson correlation analysis techniques were employed in conjunction with factor ranking to determine the internal validity, factor links and most important factors. The results showed that the majority of respondents believed that MMC could help us achieve the construction 2025 targets, with a similarity index ranking revealing that MMC would be of the most benefit to the greenhouse gas emissions and trade targets, however, all factors ranked tightly together. This body of research will benefit the UK Government, construction associations and industrial key stakeholders in their pursuit of reaching the reduction targets, and with only three years until the deadline, there is a strong chance they will promote MMC in the industry.}

abstract = {Engineering Changes (EC) are often the answers the designers think of while dealing with new performance targets or customers needs and expectations, regarding functionality, aesthetics, security, etc. Engineering change management (ECM) techniques look to predict or control these consequences within an existing system or product, to limit the generated cost and required efforts to integrate such changes. Engineering change management (ECM) techniques look to predict or control these consequences within an existing system or product, to limit the generated cost and required efforts to integrate such changes. This paper addresses the issue of enhancing the ability of the ”change evaluation” through the suggested technique. We propose a methodology that covers change analysis and evaluation from change’s objective initialization to formulation of recommendation based on system engineering framework (ANSI/EIA-649 1998). We use a modeling technique based on influence diagrams able to integrate different uncertainty levels (on dependencies) in a unique model. It will be shown that the models offer the ability to analyze change impacts but also allow to synthesize the system. Finally, these results can be obtained in a very efficient way which gives the possibility of their use during a design meeting in a practical way at the very beginning of a change project and mainly to support go/no-go decision.}

abstract = {Increasing global competition requires technological innovation with new political, commercial and technical advances empowered by market dynamics. These challenges must be met with appropriate decision-making by manufacturing companies to secure competitive advantage without compromising sustainability. This requires decision-makers to seize opportunities for improving sustainable solutions in strategic and operational activities. Various scientific and case-based methods are applied to measure the performance and sustainability level of manufacturing systems. However, embedding sustainability in decision-making has not been fully realized by academics and practitioners. This paper introduces a model- based approach for assessing value creation to enhance manufacturing sustainability. The major objective of the approach is to evaluate the strategic alignment and sustainability of the solutions to overcome a challenge related with a product, process or equipment in manufacturing. The approach proposes a framework that transforms customer requirements first into descriptive attributes to assign the value for strategic alignment and later into comprehensive metrics to measure the sustainability value. The approach provides decision-makers with a method of comparing sustainable value addition and strategic alignment when evaluating alternatives. In a case-based application, the production equipment of a service provider is evaluated to select the option that adds the most value, both strategically and sustainably, to meet customer requirements.}

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial companies are facing ever-increasing challenges to generate new value-in-use and maintain their high competitiveness in the market. With the rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), IT is embedded in the products themselves, i.e. smart, connected products (SCPs) to generate values. Hence, an emerging value proposition paradigm, smart product-service system (Smart PSS) was introduced, by leveraging both SCPs and its generated services as a solution bundle to meet individual customer needs. Unlike other types of PSS, in Smart PSS, massive user-generated data and product-sensed data are collected during the usage phase, where potential requirements can be elicited readily in a value co-creation manner with context-awareness. Nevertheless, only few scholars discuss any systematic manner to support requirement elicitation in such context. To fill the gaps, this research proposes a novel data-driven graph-based requirement elicitation framework in the Smart PSS, so as to assist engineering/designers make better design improvement or new design concept generation in a closed-loop manner. It underlines the informatics-based approach by integrating heterogeneous data sources into a holistic consideration. Moreover, by leveraging graph-based approach, context-product-service information can be linked by the edges and nodes in-between them to derive reliable requirements. To validate its feasibility and advantages, an illustrative example of smart bicycle design improvement is further adopted. As an explorative study, it is hoped that this work provides useful insights for the requirement elicitation process in today’s smart connected environment.}

We tracked 21 dugongs (Dugong dugon Müller 1776) using acoustic and satellite/GPS transmitters in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in Moreton Bay, Queensland at the high latitude limit of the species' winter range in eastern Australia to examine if there was a relationship between movements and environmental temperature that might suggest behavioural thermoregulation. Oceanic waters immediately outside the bay where the dugong's seagrass food is unavailable exhibited temperatures from 5.5 °C warmer to 3 °C cooler than the Eastern Banks, the major dugong habitat in the bay. All tracked dugongs made at least one (and up to 66) return trip(s) from the Eastern Banks to the adjacent oceanic waters. The probability of making an outgoing trip was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2013 when the water temperature inside the bay was higher than the other two years. The odds of making an outgoing trip were lower when temperature differences (outside minus inside) were small or negative but increased by a factor of up to 2.12 for each 1 °C positive difference. Individual dugongs were most likely to travel out of the bay between midnight and noon on an outgoing tide or at slack high water and return to the bay on an incoming tide or slack low water between noon and midnight. The amount of time a dugong spent outside the bay on each trip was relatively short with an overall median of 5.9 h. The dugongs' individual activity spaces generally declined as winter progressed suggesting a change in the cost-effectiveness of moving outside the bay. Our analysis adds to the evidence that dugongs undertake behavioural thermoregulation at least at the high latitude limits of their range.}

However, restoration processes are ad-hoc and complex because the "raw" materials for remanufacturing are returned used parts, which exhibit significant uncertainties in failure features involving failure location, failure mode, failure volume, and failure degree. Thus, customized remanufacturing process planning (RPP) and restoration tool paths should be generated to restore the defects for each part. An integrated restoration methodology based on adaptive failure feature identification for remanufacturing is proposed to enable efficient and cost-effective remanufacturing. In this study, an adaptive failure feature identification algorithm is developed to identify the failure features on defective parts quickly. In this stage, the point clouds of the nominal model and defective model are used to extract defective regions through Boolean operations and then calculate the failure volume and degree. Based on the identified failure features, a knowledge reuse algorithm is proposed to retrieve the optimal RPP rapidly through mixed case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR). Finally, a tool path generation algorithm of hybrid Subtractive Manufacturing (SM) and Additive Manufacturing (AM) for the restoration of identified defects. The proposed methodology is verified by remanufacturing a defective blade with multi-defects and is approved to be flexible and effective.}

To improve the quality and efficiency of shafting design, the Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) strategy was adopted to achieve the optimal design in this paper. Further, the multi-objective optimization framework was established by analyzing the characteristics of the shafting design. The optimization strategy was employed to write the optimization algorithm and multidisciplinary design optimization scheme was obtained. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed method, a shafting testing platform (STP) was taken as an example, the vertical displacements of its two bearings were determined as design variables, and its key preference indexes (KPIs) comprehensive optimization objective function was acquired due to its practice states. Then, the MDO framework of the STP was constructed. The design variables were optimized by application of multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), and the feasibility of this design idea was verified by several designed experiments.}

This study sought identifying what the green product and process expected attributes are in automobile and furniture purchases, as well as what the expanded and reduced risks are in offers with these characteristics. To reach these objectives, a qualitative research was initially performed, and, subsequently, a quantitative research was carried out with the aim to confirm the mapped data. In summary, the results obtained indicate as important green attributes for automobiles items such as “economy”, “engine” and “new technologies”. Regarding furniture important green attributes, “design”, “origin label” and “origin of the raw material” were indicated as important. Furthermore, it could be verified that the purchase of green products may increase performance and time risks and mitigate financial and social risks. In short, this study allowed for advances in the theoretical comprehension regarding green products and decision-making processes with medium- and high-involvement levels. However, once external factors such as culture and ethnicity tend to influence buyers' decision-making processes, and considering the fact that this study was executed in Brazil, distinct results may be found in other countries.}

Software tools for accompanying this evolution are needed. This article proposes the use of ontologies as a base to the development of those software tools. Formalization of the main concepts concerning inventive design is provided by the use of formal ontologies.

The proposed approach covers the full lifecycle of the data warehouse, allows capturing the interrelationships between different quality factors and helps the interested user to organize them in order to fulfill specific quality goals.

In this study, a new model based on group decision-making approach is introduced under novel compromise ranking method and interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) for the green supplier selection problems. In the proposed approach, the assessment criteria are provided by DMs based on linguistic terms which are converted to interval type-2 fuzzy elements. In this respect, decision makers' weights are computed based on an extended interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method considering the priority experts' opinions about the relative significance of criteria, and also a new ranking index is presented respecting to interval type-2 fuzzy Hamming distance measure to ranking potential alternatives. Hence, a real case study is considered to indicate the applicability of the proposed approach. In addition, results from the proposed approach are compared with the existing method in literature in order to illustrate the validation of proposed model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is prepared to identify and determine the effects of different DMs' weights on ranking results. Results show that the proposed approach is an effective and practical decision tool for green supplier selection problems in fuzzy environment.}

abstract = {The continuous improvement in TQM is considered as the core value by which organisation could maintain a competitive edge. Several techniques and tools are known to support this core value but most of the time these techniques are informal and without modelling the interdependence between the core value and tools. Thus, technique formalisation is one of TQM challenges for increasing efficiency of quality process implementation. In that way, the paper proposes and experiments an advanced quality modelling approach based on meta-modelling the “process approach” as advocated by the standard ISO9000:2000. This meta-model allows formalising the interdependence between technique, tools and core value.}

But these depots, that store the returned empty maritime containers until they are needed, have also an environmental impact in the areas where they are located. In this paper a biobjective model is considered for designing a depots network in a hinterland. The two objectives used are the total cost of the network and the environmental impact generated by the commissioning and maintenance of the container depots and by the transport operations in and out of the depots. As the capacity of a depot is not an exact value, they have been modeled as a fuzzy restriction. An additive fuzzy multiobjective optimization approach has been used to solve the problem. Results were applied to the case of the Port of Valencia, Spain.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new quality-oriented control approach for Value Engineering is proposed. It is reasonably applied within a Target Costing and Target Pricing concept in order to generate, maintain and process reliable data. On the basis of Target costs and prices, the approach determines the quality program of the relevant product core components as well as of the quality-related production stages. In order to provide decision support for various applications in business, this new approach is based on a discrete quality measure that allows for the mapping of multidimensional dependencies. After mathematically defining the underlying quality planning model, we propose an exact Dynamic Programming approach for determining optimal programs. It is shown that this procedure is strongly polynomial if the number of resulting intermediate product quality levels does not increase exponentially. Subsequently, in order to provide decision support for the level of real-time Value Engineering, a variance analysis scheme for examining the consequences of actual decisions is proposed. In addition to controlling and understanding the process of decision-making in sales and production departments, its iterative application makes it possible to systematically attain insights into the controlled processes and, in doing so, supports decision-oriented management accounting.}

In such a context, simulation – in its wider meaning – could play a relevant role for engineering the life cycle of a product and analyzing the related service networks. Within this context, the paper conducts a state of the art review of existing solutions implementing LCS, in order to identify common characteristics and prioritize next steps to be done for a comprehensive implementation. To this end a reference architecture is proposed.}

The results of the new tunneling models are compared to those of the conventional models adopting the parabolic dispersion laws. It turns out that the physically well justified Franz relation yields typically a better agreement with experiments compared to the parabolic relation despite offering less freedom in term of adjustable parameters.}

A review of published literature reveals that the tools available for such assessments can be applied primarily when at least an embodiment of the product design is achieved. However, the environmental impacts of the product may be determined in earlier design stages. The objective of this research is to study if the environmental performance of a product can be predicted from the requirements list elicited early on in the design process. For this purpose, an environmental assessment tool (SLCA) is used to estimate the environmental performance of final products, while a rubric is developed to evaluate the requirements list of those same products in terms of environmental impacts. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures (18,900) are used to relate the information gained from the rubric to predict the SLCA scores calculated for corresponding products. The products used for training and testing are drawn from student design projects. The results show that the predictions are stable, with residual errors of less than half the range of target values. The maximum prediction error was found to be 27% while the average prediction error was 10%. However, the accuracy of the predictions depends on the selection of the training and test sets. Moreover, the scalability of this approach to industrial applications should be explored. Opportunities for future work are identified to improve the method for early assessment of environmental impacts of products.}

Only then will there be the driving forces necessary for adopting sustainable product development practices. A risk management approach can be used to enable strategic proactivity by exposing the potential consequences of sustainability-related decisions, for example in relation to reputation, legislative change, the ability to attract top talent, or meeting customer needs. Through an action research approach and by building on previous findings and existing tools and methods, this study presents the Sustainability Impact and Effects Analysis. This novel method and risk management tool combines the familiar format of the well-established Failure Mode and Effects Analysis with a strategic sustainability perspective. Designed to be applicable in early stages of the product innovation process, this tool aims to increase decision-makers’ awareness of sustainability risks and provide them with a practical way for how to identify, assess, and treat such risks. The tool was developed in close collaboration with industry and tested in two different companies. The results indicate the effectiveness of the tool for identifying and analyzing sustainability risks, as well as deriving and monitoring strategies for how to manage them strategically, also leading to an increased awareness of the interconnections between socio-ecological sustainability aspects and business implications. Thereby, it can provide support for companies in how to work with product development in a way that contributes to society's transition towards sustainability, while benefiting the own organization.}

In this study, which is about the circular economy in sustainable supply chain management, the contribution of blockchain technology to agri-food supply chain management is discussed. The aim of the study is to research, analyze and prioritize the critical success factors of the use of blockchain technology for the agri-food sector on the way to the circular economy. As a first step, with the help of PESTEL analysis approach, 12 critical success factors for agri-food supply chain management under the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal dimensions of blockchain technology within the scope of circular economy are determined. Analytic Network Process (ANP) and MultiAtributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA) methods are used in an integrated way to consider the degree of influence between the factors and to determine the ideal optimal factor. In the results, it is determined that the political and technological sub-criteria of blockchain technology is determined, and it is observed that the criteria handled in line with the sustainability system are compatible with the perspective of reducing the waste of resources of the circular economy. If blockchain technology is used in the agri-food sector, it has been determined that it will contribute to the circular economy with the success factors in this study. “Ability to prevent food waste”; “Increased food security”; “Product lifecycle tracking” factors take priority in their ranking.}

Concomitantly, due to the recent advocacy of green shipping, how to deploy effectively a shipping fleet so as to reduce the environmental cost has become an increasingly crucial issue in the shipping industries. However, it has not been investigated how the optimal shipping allocation between the conventional Asia-Europe route and NEP, based on both economic and environmental considerations, will be influenced by different aspects of shipping costs respectively, which will further affect the ocean carriers’ decision and adoption attitude toward the NEP. In this paper, a quantitative assessment model considering the shipment operating cost as well as the external cost of various pollutant emissions is presented to analyze the multi-port multi-trip liner service in an Asia-Europe container shipping network. Based on the shipping network with cargo demand of an Asian shipping company and empirical data from the existing literature, our study demonstrates how the optimal shipping allocation varies between scenarios by performing sensitivity analyses. Our findings indicate that the icebreaker fee, as well as Suez Canal toll, plays a more decisive role than the fuel price in affecting the adoption of the NEP. The relevant policy and managerial implications are discussed.}

To construct a C-scan image from the wavelet transform of the A-scan signals, we propose a selection process of the wavelet coefficients, followed by an interpretation procedure based on a windowing process in the time–frequency domain.

We use the EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) method and interval type-2 fuzzy sets for evaluation of suppliers with respect to environmental criteria. According to this evaluation two parameters are defined for each supplier: positive score and negative score. These parameters, together with cost parameters, are utilized to propose a multi-objective mathematical model for determination of order quantity from each supplier. A numerical example is used in this paper to show the applicability of the proposed integrated model. Also, a sensitivity analysis is made to examine the effect of weighting environmental criteria on total purchasing cost and quantity of order from each supplier. The results show that the proposed model is efficient and applicable for real-world problems.}

Higher education is increasingly recognized as a service industry, and this puts a greater emphasis on meeting the expectations and needs of its participating customers who are the students. Due to intense competition, many universities and colleges face declining student enrolment and there is a need to address the problem of the quality of programmes and services offered. This study evaluates the service quality of a Malaysian private higher education institution with the objective of determining what constitutes the service variables in the education industry. Using gap analysis, it examines whether there are any service gaps in the individual service quality attributes. Five specified dimensions, namely tangibles, empathy, assurance, reliability and responsiveness at the educational institution, were examined. Data was collected from respondents using a well-structured questionnaire designed and adapted for the provision of educational services in line with SERVQUAL dimension scale. To achieve this, students as respondents were surveyed on their expected and perceived service quality rendered to them and their opinions garnered on whether service quality has had any effect on their satisfaction. A total of 150 questionnaires were distributed to students who had enrolled at the educational institution. Using service gap analysis, the findings indicated negative gaps for empathy and assurance dimensions. With the aid of service improvement matrix (SIM), satisfaction based on service perception and importance based on service expectation were plotted on a two-dimensional grid. This allowed for service improvement decisions to be made such as service improvements that are both necessary (low satisfaction ratings) and important for students (high importance ratings). Service strategies are recommended to managers to improve service quality and promote student satisfaction.}

abstract = {Background
Despite implications for theory and treatment, commonality in responding to non-bereavement and bereavement losses are not well explicated.
Method
This study identified the factor structure of the three most common responses to bereavement, prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and major depression in a bereaved community sample (n=151, 59% female, 68% white) from the U.S. recruited from Amazon’s MTurk using a cross-sectional survey design, then cross-validated the structure in samples where people had lost other potentially self-defining roles; one’s employment (n=157, 47% female, 69% white) and one’s marriage (n=116, 62% female, 80% white).
Results
Results indicated that symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and major depression were distinct factors in the bereaved sample, the three-factor solution was a good fit for the job-loss and divorce samples, and levels of grief in each sample appeared to be best predicted by time since loss and centrality of the loss to one’s identity.
Limitations
Limitations include potential sample bias due to convenience sampling, and the cross-sectional design did not allow examination of the stability of factors over time.
Conclusions
These results suggest that grief is not a unique response to loss of loved one but instead may be a common phenomenology across types of loss. This implies that facilitating meaningful engagement in self-defining activities that compensate for the disrupting loss might be efficacious in promoting grief resolution without the need for working through individuals’ emotional attachment to a specific individual or processing one’s emotional responses to the loss.}

This problem has been discussed widely and effectively using multi-attribute methods in a manufacturing context, but it has been little studied in agribusiness. The goal of this work is a methodological approach oriented to evaluate optimal locations of new agri-food warehouses. Furthermore, a literature review is developed, analyzing the location problem and the attributes and techniques most widely used applied to agribusiness, and a case-study is presented in order to exemplify the methodological proposal. The multi-attribute technique called Analytic Hierarchy Process has been selected as the basis for the research, and it is applied to the real case study analyzed: the selection of a site for a new banana distribution warehouse. Six generic criteria have been analyzed: accessibility to the area, distance, cost, security of the region, local acceptance of the company, and its needs. The process includes the assignment of attributes to each one of the generic criteria, as well as the assessment of their importance levels. Three different areas of Guadalajara, Jalisco, and Mexico DF have been evaluated for the case-study, and the methodological proposal has been utilized to determine the best option.}

Green Lean Six Sigma (GLS) is one of the inclusive approaches that reduces the variations and wastes in the system and at the same time decreases the negative environmental impact. But, in order to implement a comprehensive GLS approach, it is indispensable to look at the enablers or foundations that consequently lead to the success of this program. The present work deals with GLS enablers identification and modeling using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to meticulously adjudicate interactions among the enablers. Besides, Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) analysis has been used here to classify these enablers for better understanding. This work will facilitate the organizations to have a readiness for a strategic GLS implementation by detailed understanding of mutual relations among the enablers of GLS.}

Through PSS, companies create new business opportunities, extend the market share, differentiate the product portfolio, and improve sustainability. The PSS approach shifts the company attention from producing physical products to offering integrated systems. However, ideating and designing a PSS is a complex and multifaceted process, which requires multiple competences and cross-functions cooperation within the manufacturing company. In fact, the design phase requires to simultaneous dal with the characteristics of the physical product and of the intangible services, the last ones being by their nature fuzzy and difficult to define. Furthermore, the two entities have to be synergistically delivered and strategically managed thanks to the adoption of a PSS lifecycle management methodology and tools, in particular for the creation of a proper PSS infrastructure to delivery and maintain all the components from the design to the end of life phases. Several methodologies to design PSS can be found in literature. Most of them focus on technical development stages, while some of them face also the innovation aspects and sustainability. However, traditional product-centered approaches are not able to fully support the processes that manufacturing companies have to put in place for creating PSSs. This paper presents a new approach, based on the combination of the Open innovation method with IT solutions supporting information sharing and intra-team cooperation, in that any manufacturing company could adopt to manage the design process of a PSS. In particular, the methodology and the tools are focused on the early stages of the PSS design process, as Ideation and Concept definition that have been developed within the European FP7 project FLEXINET.}

This paper explores the innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the ambiance of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to address the challenge. We investigate AI's potential to enhance road safety globally, utilizing data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent traffic management systems. Our goal is to revolutionize accident prevention by optimizing decision-making processes and promoting safer and more efficient road environments. In the realm of information aggregation and fusion, growing interest among researchers has centered on probabilistic linguistic expression sets, which adeptly aggregate uncertain data. This article's primary aim is to explore methodologies for aggregating information within a probabilistic linguistic environment. To achieve this goal, we have introduced procedural laws based on the Sugeno-Weber (SW) framework for handling probabilistic linguistic term elements (PLTEs), rooted in both the product and sum of SW operations. Consequently, we have crafted a range of probabilistic linguistic aggregation techniques, encompassing the probabilistic linguistic SW Average (PLSWA) and Geometric (PLSWG), followed by weighted as well as ordered aggregation operators like PLSWWA and PLSWWG, PLSWOWA and PLSWOWG. By harnessing SW τ-norm and τ-conorm, we have developed versatile aggregation tools that facilitate information reinforcement. Through the utilization of proposed operators, we have presented strategies for effectively integrating probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTs) in the context of MCDM. We have compared our suggested procedures with the TOPSIS approach and elucidated the diverse features inherent to these operators.}

abstract = {Evaluating the performance of supply chains (SC) is a critical activity to enhance the outcomes of operations along the SC tiers. In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.}

An evaluation methodology to estimate social housing envelope degradation level was developed which has been applied to a set of social housing. Following this study, the methodology revealed adequate for any sort of buildings, taking into account their specific features that necessitate some methodology modifications. To support the visual survey of the external building envelope, tables applying the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) were used to analyse the principal causes and effects of the anomalies identified. To evaluate the main visible anomalies on their external envelope, two evaluation scales have been created: one for the degradation degree applicable to each typified anomaly and the other for the performance level of each building respect to a set of functional requirements. The degradation level of each of the principal anomalies was determined as well as the evaluation index of the building envelope. Degradation evaluation results were obtained through visual survey and were aggregated by two methods developed for the research: one based on the Hermione aggregation method and the other on the results of the inquiry to tenants based on a multi-attribute analysis attending to the relatively importance (weight) of the evaluated requirements. Each attributed weight was obtained throughout the expressed opinion of technicians and specialists from the construction sector. The aim of this paper is to present the visual survey methodology of the envelope degradation level and the results obtained for the degradation degree of each typified anomaly, and the performance level of each building in respect of a set of functional requirements.}

Application of traditional tools of process improvement cannot lead to significant evolution of process maturity and capability. Even the use of TRIZ-related tools has limitations in defining an ideal solution because in complex adaptive nonlinear systems optimality cannot be achieved. Therefore, an enhanced way of applying TRIZ for process improvement projects is considered in this paper. The proposed algorithm identifies the pool of obstacles and applies TRIZ in relation with each obstacle. Afterwards, a strategy is considered to handle a long list of inventive principles for generating and ordering appropriate improvement projects. The proposed algorithm is successfully tested in the case of a company dealing with software development services. Results demonstrates the concept effectiveness and reveals that active improvement of complex processes requires a well-scheduled implementation of a well-directed package of interrelated and convergent improvement projects.}
