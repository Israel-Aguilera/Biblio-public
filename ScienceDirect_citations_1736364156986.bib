abstract = {Open-architecture products (OAPs) allow users to add personalized functional modules in an original product to meet changeable requirements for the product. The development of personalized products requires users’ involvement to meet the users’ needs effectively. The existing methods of Internet-based interactive platforms and direct market user surveys cannot provide users full experience of product features. This research proposes a virtual reality (VR)-based interactive system to improve users’ involvement in OAPs development. The system consists of a user interactive interface, a product model-processing module, a function execution module, a data recording and process analyzing module. Users operate the product model in the VR environment to experience the product. A soft-bag folding machine designed using the OAP concept is used in a case study to verify the proposed method.}

This study proposes an integrated method that combines the Best-Worst Method and fuzzy TODIM (Interactive and Multi-criteria Decision-Making, the acronym in Portuguese) approach to prioritize strategies for maritime supply chain resilience. Unlike prior research, our study suggests that resilience strategy selection varies across different risk scenarios. The present study undertakes a thorough examination of strategies for enhancing maritime supply chain resilience in response to three typical scenarios: port congestion, labor shortage, and abnormal freight rate fluctuation. The findings demonstrate that accelerated container turnover, human resource backup, and long-term shipping contracts emerge as paramount strategies for effectively improving resilience. This study establishes a cornerstone for the development of maritime emergency management protocols, grounded in the systematic analysis of risk scenarios.}

Traditional strategies were based on the principle of economies of scale, which resulted in excess of waste and difficulty of reconfiguration. Global competition necessitates formulating efficient and effective paradigms in response to the global economies to improve the overall performance. Lean and agile manufacturing have been widely adopted in recent years’ enterprises. Leanness mainly leads to eliminating the non-value added activities while agility focuses on leads to market responsiveness. This paper discusses the leanness and agility definitions, factors, paradigms, differences, and combination. A hierarchic framework is presented which can be used to measure the leanness, agility, leagility, and overall performance of an enterprise, further, to compare different enterprises. This enables using the multi-criteria decision making methods especially AHP and ANP. Levels of leanness and agility can be fed as input to define a variety of enterprises. Moreover, a different view is introduced for general features of an efficient/effective manufacturing organization irrespective to the definitions of leanness and agility.}

However, the overall volume of literature dedicated to DfRem is low and there is still much to learn about the subject. The purpose of this literature review is to collate the current body of literature and establish a contemporary understanding of DfRem through analysing the trends, agreements and conflicts of opinion in the field. Much of the DfRem literature to date is focused upon the investigation of remanufacturing problems associated with product design, and the subsequent development of design methods and tools, either specifically developed to aid DfRem or as adaptations of existing design methods. These methods and tools vary in purpose and intended use but all largely remain within the academic realm to date. Within the literature there is widespread agreement that any approach to DfRem must consider both product and process, yet the ‘design for X’ definition of the task continues to spark debate. The key problems and issues that future DfRem research should address have been identified in this paper, from both within the literature and from the current gaps in the literature. Some key recommendations for future research include the need for ‘lifecycle thinking’ within design method development and the need for greater exploration into the organisational factors affecting DfRem integration into the design process, from the perspectives of the OEM and designer.}

abstract = {Those professionals who are charged with improving the new product development (NPD) process may well feel as though they have been asked to bring order out of chaos. For every level in the organization, and for every step in the NPD process, they must contend with myriad, often interdependent choices—of products and processes; of tools and technologies; of proven best practices and hypothesized solutions. In turn, each choice may cascade into several additional decisions. With so many issues to address and so many variables to consider, practioners and researchers alike need a clear, but complete, framework for exploring, understanding, and improving the NPD process. To help bring some order to the study and the practice of NPD management, W. Austin Spivey, J. Michael Munson, and John H. Wolcott introduce a new metaphor, or paradigm, for product development: a fractal paradigm. Like some fractal images, their framework for understanding the essence of NPD rests on the concept of self-similarity. In other words, the picture their framework provides for understanding and managing the NPD process consists of the same set of concerns, regardless of the level at which the process is viewed. They developed this fractal paradigm during an empirical study of technology transition in a highly successful federal laboratory organization. Whether the focus is on the organization, the division, the team, or the individual, the essence of the NPD process as viewed through their framework comes down to two sets of factors: management factors and resource factors. In turn, each of these factors cascades into several interrelated sets of concerns. For example, the management factors comprise concerns about leadership and the management system. The resource factors include concerns about information, infrastructure, time, and money. Regardless of the level of detail at which the framework is viewed, improving the NPD process requires attention to all of these factors, by all levels within the organization. For example, visionary leadership on the part of senior management will have little effect if middle management and line supervisors fail to provide the necessary leadership for their respective groups of subordinates. Notwithstanding the complexity of the NPD process, the fractal paradigm focuses attention on those few key factors that must be managed continually, throughout all levels of the organization, to ensure successful commercialization of new products.}

abstract = {PSS is a growing field of research in industry practice in today's global economy. It is a new trend that has an impact on both the production and consumption of resources. PSS aims at a more profitable and conservational usage of products. While in the past providing services was one of the strategies attained to differentiate in competition, however today providing a product together with many services has become a standard practice in the product industry. To remain competitive, manufacturers are forced not only to produce a competitive product however rather a superior PSS.PSS are outlined as life cycle bound combinations of a product and completely different services, having sophisticated networks, that comprise a manufacturer as a provider and also as a repair partner. To enable the applicability of a PSS in an industry, it is essential to evaluate the system using metrics – the SERVQUAL MODEL, which defines “The quality as the difference between the customers' expectations & perceptions concerning the services delivered to them” [1]. It is catered to measure quality by capturing the expectancy – confirmation paradigm which suggests the consumer's perceived quality of how well a given service delivery meets their expectations of that delivery. So this SERVQUAL metric is used to determine the level of quality in the industry and the five dimensions are such as tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance & empathy are measured using a five-point Likert scale. Since, organizations are more and more moving towards knowledge-based strategies, developing and managing knowledge is essential for improving the organizational performance as well as for enhancing decision-making process. This paper presents a review on the use of a knowledge management practice in PSS for industries to store, share and utilize knowledge for enhancing creativity & innovation in their service systems. An efficient review of the literature has been conducted in the academic and scientific databases taking into account the date of publication of the articles titled PSS, SERVQUAL and KMS from 2009 to 2020. To achieve the review process, all selected articles have been categorized by publication year, the objectives of the research, the methodology used, the results, conclusion and future scope of their research are presented on a broader scale [16]. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of the literature on PSS and the evaluation methods using SERVQUAL MODEL and the role of knowledge management in PSS and the appropriate ideas for conducting research in the future.}

Aiming to bridge this gap, an integrated way is proposed for smart PSS design. This study refines a generic approach for structural service innovation approach which integrates the advantage of PSS engineering and service engineering for designing smart product service systems. The structural design approach is based on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) incorporating with service blueprint named PRR method. Three design phases are demonstrated as verification of the PRR method by an elaborated case study of the smart beauty service. Based on PRR, three key design phases are integrated, i.e., (1) problem definition, (2) resolution generation, and (3) resolution design. Empirical results and implications are collected and discussed to obtain valuable insights for value creation.}

Recent events, including the devastating floods or wildfires and the impacts of the volatility of international relations, have underscored the vulnerability of SCs. The study explores the critical need for combining supply chain management, risk management, and sustainability for the systematic analysis of disruption risks from the unpredictability of natural disasters, man-made events, and rapid technological advancements. We develop a decision support system integrating the fuzzy C-means clustering and integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach for risk categorization and prioritization, respectively. The developed framework considers the significance of multiple risk factors (e.g., urgency and vulnerability) in the risk disruption analysis process through the hybrid Bayesian best-worst method-combined compromise solution approach. This enables managers to identify critical disruption risks (e.g., communication network disruptions, production facility-related risk, and increased demand for certain goods) while observing their adverse effects on the resiliency of sustainable SCs. Compared to the traditional risk priority number, the proposed system includes the importance of risk factors and provides a more stable and separable ranking, empowering managers to deal with potential resource limitations. This study also suggests risk mitigation strategies to alleviate the negative consequences of disruptions within organizational constraints and improve sustainable SC responsiveness to future disasters.}

The main challenge for affective design originates from difficulties in mapping customers' subjective impressions, namely Kansei, to perceptual design elements. This paper intends to develop an explicit decision support to improve the Kansei mapping process by reusing knowledge from past sales records and product specifications. As one of the important applications of data mining, association rule mining lends itself to the discovery of useful patterns associated with the mapping of affective needs. A Kansei mining system is developed to utilize valuable affect information latent in customers' impressions of existing affective designs. The goodness of association rules is evaluated according to their achievements of customers' expectations. Conjoint analysis is applied to measure the expected and achieved utilities of a Kansei mapping relationship. Based on goodness evaluation, mapping rules are further refined to empower the system with useful inference patterns. The system architecture and implementation issues are discussed in detail. An application of Kansei mining to mobile phone affective design is presented.}

These practices are widely adopted by industries through reverse logistics partners. However, the evaluation and selection of the reverse logistics partner is a matter of concern which needs a very grave decision, involving complexity due to presence of numerous associated factors. In addition, it is hypothesized that the decision makers might be inconsistent to some extent in their views and preferences that affect other dominant constituents. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate sort of information may occur among various selection criteria, which is termed ‘multi-criteria decision making’ (MCDM) problem. The goal of the present study is to discuss an integrated model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for evaluation and prioritization of selection criteria and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) for the selection and development of reverse logistics partner. This study is an attempt to present a genuine concern of Indian electronics industry using an integrated approach to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework as well. In this study two stage sensitivity analyses are performed to get further insight of evaluation and selection of RL partner and verification of robustness of the model. This study aims to provide a significant contribution to electronics organizations in evaluation and selection of third party RL partner while achieving efficiency and effectiveness in RL practices.}

Experiments carried out during 2014-2015 had a polyfactorial character; variants were set after the randomised block method with three replicates specific to experiments in forced protected areas of vegetable culture. Factor A (cultivar) with 5 graduations: a1 – Délibáb F1; a2 – Sláger F1; a3 – Bolero F1; a4 – SJD 5; a5 – SJN 5. Factor B (planting scheme) with 4 graduations: b1 – 40+80x20cm → 8,3 plants/m2; b2 – 40+80x30cm → 5,5 plants/m2; b3 – 40+80x40cm → 4,2 plants/m2; b4 – 40+80x50cm → 3,3 plants/m2. Unilateral statistic evaluation of the influence of genotype and of plant density on fruit length is distinctly significant on the background of significant influence of environmental conditions during the experimental years. Changing the planting distance per row from 20 to 30 and to 50cm resulted in significant increase of fruit length of 8-18%. The combined effect of genotype and plant density had considerable influences (18.81%) on fruit diameter, a value that is distinctly significant. The bell pepper hybrid Bolero and the bell pepper line SJD 5 cultivated at a plant density of 8.3 plants/m2 (80/40x20cm) produce pulp thickness superior to that of the experimental mean.}

abstract = {Sustainable development has occupied a vital position in the field of service design. Since it requires the linkage between economic value and environmental benefits, how to organize service models with social networks becomes a key issue. Related studies generally focus on reducing cost and waste through product-based services; organizational activities and policy-oriented services are relatively ignored. In addition, few methods are adopted to generate service concepts with operational techniques or principles. Hence, “feedback map” and “service flow modeling” are proposed in this paper to help decision makers build appropriate service models. These tools are integrated with existing methods and knowledge, making a systematic framework to handle the information flows in service design. A workshop with the experiment is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results indicate that this framework provides comprehensive information and guidance to fit service activities to sustainable development. It also improves the cooperation across profit and non-profit sectors and different knowledge domains, assisting planners in exploring more possibilities of service types. Moreover, it considers not only product development but also relative strategies or actions for sustainability. It appears that this approach is applicable to deal with complicated situations involving multiple service participants.}

abstract = {We consider QCD instanton-induced contributions to lepton pair production in hadron–hadron collisions. We relate these contributions to those known from deep inelastic scattering and demonstrate that they can be calculated reliably for sufficiently large momentum transfer. We observe that the instanton contribution to the angular distribution of the lepton pairs at finite momentum transfer strongly violates the Lam–Tung relation—a relation between coefficient functions of the angular distribution which is valid within the framework of ordinary perturbation theory. The drastic violation of this relation, as seen in experimental data, might be related to such instanton-induced effects.}

A quality system consists of the organizational structure, responsibilities, processes and resources needed to achieve quality objectives for products, services, and customer satisfaction. The system is capable of sustaining the environment and means by which superior products and services are profitably designed, developed, and delivered to customers on time and defect free. A quality system also catalyzes an organization to become a learning organization. At the initial stage, the quality system drives systematic problem solving, experimentation with new approaches, and learning from experience and history. Furthermore, the quality system drives an organization to benchmark world-class operations as well as capture and apply the learned knowledge. This paper provides a thorough view of the quality system architecture, its required elements, and implementation approach.}

In the US–Mexico borderland, urbanization and construction of the border fence have the potential to increase genetic subdivision and vulnerability to isolation in large mammal populations by bisecting movement corridors that have enabled dispersal between adjacent Sky Island mountain ranges. We examined genetic variation in black bears (Ursus americanus) from three regions in central and southern Arizona, US, to assess genetic and landscape connectivity in the US–Mexico border Sky Islands. We found that the three regions grouped into two subpopulations: the east-central subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the central highland and high desert regions, and the border subpopulation comprised of individuals sampled in the southern Sky Islands. Occupancy for the border subpopulation of black bears was influenced by cover type and distance to water, and occupancy-based corridor models identified 14 potential corridors connecting border Sky Island habitat cores with the east-central subpopulation. Biological quality of corridors, defined as length:width ratio and proportions of suitable habitat within corridors, declined with Sky Island dispersion. Our results show that black bears in the border subpopulation are moderately isolated from the east-central subpopulation, the main population segment of black bears in Arizona, and that connectivity for border bears may be vulnerable to anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with urbanization and trans-border security.}

Every process and operation must be designed in the best possible way to ensure that the overall process chain leads to the right product quality. During the last two decades a shift from inspection of manufactured products to a more holistic approach with quality assurance as an integrated activity throughout the product realization process has emerged in manufacturing industry. The importance of the principles addressed in the methods and tools used in automotive industry for quality management is indisputable. However, the tasks of creating and managing documents for Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), Control plans, Initial process studies and Measurement System Analysis (MSA) results in high workload. Also, lack of interoperability between different computer applications used in process planning and quality assurance results in information fragmentation, data duplication and potential data inconsistency. This paper proposes a novel, model driven approach for process planning integrating quality assurance which emphasizes the application of digital models to create, represent and use information of products, processes and resources. By reducing the amount of data and document duplication, the presented model driven approach has potential to radically increase the direct value adding part of manufacturing engineer's daily work also contributing to achieve a more holistic view in interdisciplinary work between different experts in product realization.}

The chronic responses of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to climatic factors on the Three-river Headwaters (TRH) region were assessed for major vegetation types at the herbage developmental stages using the geographical detectors model, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from remote sensing images, and precipitation and air temperature datasets from 2000 to 2019. The results indicated that precipitation was the dominant driver for alpine meadows and steppes, while the impact of temperature on alpine steppes was more evident than that in alpine meadows, and alpine shrubs were more responsive to warming changes. This was possibly because shallower root systems and larger plant leaf area promote the responses of ANPP to precipitation for alpine meadows and steppes, and dormant buds higher from the ground facilitate the impacts of temperature for alpine shrubs. Grasslands also demonstrated differentiated responses to climatic factors at different developmental stages. Precipitation during the previous withering (September–October), pre-growing season (March–April), and vegetative growth (May–June) stages were more influential for ANPP variations. In contrast, ANPP during the reproductive period from July to August exhibited a weaker response to climatic controls. This was possibly attributed to the bud bank replenishment in fall and spring, the largest biomass growth rates in vegetative growth stage, and the non-structural carbohydrates transferred from roots in reproductive stage for perennial herbaceous plants. An elevated temperature, combined with no significant change in precipitation on the TRH may lead to a decrease in ANPP in alpine meadows but alpine shrub expansion, resulting in a reduced supply of palatable forage sources and bringing challenges to grassland management.}

Results of this investigation demonstrate that when the fracture conductivity is stress dependent, the use of conventional techniques to evaluate fractured wells may lead to incorrect estimates of the fracture-formation properties. For finite conductivity fractures, the stress effects in the formation have a negligible influence on the absolute value of the slope that defines the pseudo-bilinear flow regime. During this flow regime only the pressure sensitivity in the fracture and the fracture conductivity govern this flow period. For cases that involve highly conductive fractures, it was found that the slope of 0.5 which defines the linear flow regime is not influenced by the stress effect of the fracture and formation. However, stress in highly conductive fractures has a measureable influence in the change of conductivity. The occurrence of the stress damage in finite and infinite conductivity fractures is due to the partial closure fracture or partial choke fracture effect and can be anticipated in terms of pressure or time level by using the equations provided in this work. The results derived from this research have a major impact in improving the analysis of fractured wells pressure responses, as well as in forecasting of fracture closure occurrence and in programming stimualtion operations in fractured wells. An example with synthetic data is presented to illustrate these new findings.}

In this context, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) offers several advantages: it is a knowledge-based approach for problem-solving that links the problem requirements with some engineering models to guide the solving process. However, the learning process of TRIZ and its use with a practical purpose reveal many drawbacks. A significant problem, while using TRIZ, emerges when the user needs to analyze and formulate an inventive problem. To deal with this issue, a combination of TRIZ with other tools seems the best strategy. The use of the Functional Analysis (FA) is one of the best examples. Despite the usefulness of the FA technique, a difficulty remains: it is a complex task to model the causal relationship between several parameters or conditions within a system. However, a tool used in the System Dynamics Modeling deals well with this situation. The System Dynamics (SD) analyzes the nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time. Congruent with recent TRIZ advances, the SD is a computer aided-approach with an extended application domain, practically in any complex system-social, managerial, economic or natural system defined by some relationships, a flow of information, and some effects of causality. Hence, SD can produce useful information when there are several conflicts in a system, also called a problem network. SD uses a graphical tool to model the variables and states of a system: The Causal-Loop Diagram. This tool is helpful to explain a conflict, the change of a system, or merely the interactions that take place to obtain an effect. This article presents a comparison between the Functional Analysis and the Causal-Loop Diagram to model inventive problems.}

The CREDIT analysis highlights among the two most critical barriers, the costs of the activities that occur at the EoL stage and the urgency to train designers to approach design thinking to the whole Product Lifecycle; here an innovative focus of research can be more incisive to overcome the actual barriers. Future research needs to focus the attention on the potentialities hidden behind a strong cooperation between academies and enterprises in order to find a balance among the several existing DfX or unveil and tackle their single limitations.

As the results of these decisions, environmental, economic, and social problems arise such as shortages, food waste and production costs. The food production systems are affected by uncertainties caused by demand, delays, and inefficiencies. Thus, some efficient decision-making tools are required to deal with uncertain parameters in food inventory and production problems. In this study, storage and production activities of a catering company that produces daily meals are examined, and it is aimed to minimize the food waste and costs arising from these activities. We propose a linear programming (LP) model considering fuzzy parameters. In this way, the effects of the change in parameters on the total cost, workforce size, inventory and production decisions and food waste minimization are investigated. The presented model makes the decision to keep the raw material in inventory or to use it in production, considering the shelf life and age. Through the fuzzy parameter model, a scenario analysis including 112 different solutions were carried out. In this way, the total cost has been reduced 1.7% and a plan was proposed where production could be carried out with less labor. Similarly, 3% change in demand has been reflected in the fuzzy model, thereby 39% improvement was achieved in the amount of wasted food. The results show that fuzzy parameters have a critical impact on production, stock decisions and total cost at different levels. According to results, considering the uncertainty is an important factor to achieve the economic and environmental sustainability of the food sector.}

abstract = {The decision to include remanufacturing as part of product life cycle should be made as early as possible, as many barriers that occur during the remanufacturing process can be mitigated through proper product design at an early stage. The main objective of this research is to develop a Design for Remanufacturing and Remanufacturability Assessment (DRRA) tool to be used at early product definition stage. The design support tool will adopt the Fuzzy TOPSIS method to facilitate product design for remanufacturing from four major design perspectives, namely material selection, material joining methods, structure design and surface coating methods. Simplified Life Cycle Analysis methods have also been incorporated into the decision support tool to justify and improve the robustness of the design decision making. The utility of this tool is demonstrated using automotive parts design.}

Costs incurred on mineral identification are high and at times lead to failure in identification. Hence, a deeper and accurate study is required to identify the elements available. Many tools and techniques have been used like XRD, XRF, and Raman Spectroscopy etc. A new and versatile technique for qualitative and quantitative material analysis is laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) used in developed countries. This study aims at developing a new product, a low-cost portable, gross weight 3 kg, hand held LIBS tool for instant element identification with provision for mobile access of emission spectra and online system monitoring using cloud. The device is to be eco-friendly and a solar power backup will be provided. The challenges of miniaturization, portability, indigenization, cost and accuracy of data obtained will be addressed in this project.}

This study presents a systematic review of the literature focused on the interface between these two areas. The review has identified six core themes based on 49 retrieved papers: (A) Integral Productivity, (B) Order Entry Points and Modularity, (C) Product Life Cycle Management, (D) Sourcing Decisions and Supplier Involvement, (E) Integrated Processes and Coordination, and (F) Enabling through Information and Communication Technology. Five of these themes, A-E, are discussed in the paper, using the retrieved works complemented by additional literature, case evidence from the literature as well as additional cases. A generic reference model is used to support the in-depth review of literature and cases. The study shows that tremendous progress during the past 20 years has been made in approaches for managing the interface by both researchers providing generic concepts and practitioners to overcome obstacles for implementation; at the same the paper also identifies gaps in the literature from both theoretical and practical perspectives. An extensive research agenda is proposed to address the gaps identified. It is argued that across all themes further research on this critical interface needs to consider the degree of novelty in new product development, engineering and manufacturing as mediating factor. However, it is also noted that companies seem to manage this interface effectively despite it being challenging, albeit sometimes very practically and intuitively.}

However, the abundance of features and options has made it challenging to select the right alternative. In this regard, we propose a text analytics-based product recommender system that leverages online reviews as peers' recommendations and creates a shortlist of available alternatives based on existing users’ perceptions. It uses a pre-trained transformer-based aspect-level sentiment analysis algorithm, InstructABSA, to quantify consumer sentiments expressed in textual reviews, which are analysed using the integrated House of Quality (HoQ) and Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation-II (PROMETHEE-II) to construct a relative performance index for the selected manufacturers. The proposed framework may assist potential customers in making well-informed purchase decisions and help manufacturers understand their relative position in the market. It also helps customers compare the alternatives concerning selected features and associated consumer perceptions. In addition, manufacturers may use it to discover their perceived strengths and weaknesses. The proposed framework is tested on a review dataset pertaining to 12 smartwatch manufacturers, and their relative ranks are proposed.}

Hence, a tool is required to help purchasing managers to consider resilience and sustainability approaches in the supplier selection decision under disruption situation. This paper fulfills this necessity with proposing a resilient-sustainable framework based on the supplier selection indicators. Moreover, a fuzzy set theory is applied to cope with the uncertainty in the supplier selection decision. Furthermore, a modular Fuzzy Inference System is designed to calculate the affinity indices of suppliers to resiliency and sustainability issues. The modular FIS system supports to have a comprehensive supplier selection model with any number of indicators and suppliers. Then, the results of the proposed modular FIS are passed to an Assurance Region DEA method (AR-DEA) to determine the weights of indicators to rank the suppliers. The applicability of the proposed integrated intelligent model investigated by a real case. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model, sensitivity analysis has been adopted.}

However, in the design process of intelligent elderly products, there is a lack of a set of perfect method model and evaluation criteria for the application of humanistic care factors in intelligent elderly products. To standardize the use of humanistic care factors in the design of intelligent elderly products. Firstly, this study uses grounded theory to code and analyze the humanistic care factors. Secondly, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP) are used for comparative study to obtain the sensitivity priority of the application of humanistic care factors, and a new design method model is proposed. Finally, the fuzzy evaluation method is used to verify the rationality of the design method model. The study shows that the use of humanistic care factors has the greatest impact on emotion, especially in the consideration of Interactivity, followed by Color mildness and Companionship. The results are divided in the form of a hierarchical demand tower, to establish a new Humanistic-care Factors Application Hierarchical Design-model (HFAHD) for intelligent elderly products. The HFAHD can not only help designers to improve the design efficiency in the design of intelligent elderly products, but also further standardize the use of humanistic care factors in the design of intelligent elderly products. Through the combination of quantitative research and qualitative research, it is proposed to divide the use of humanistic care factors into hierarchical models to help designers better use the HFAHD. This study not only improves the design standards of intelligent elderly products, but also extends to other design fields in further research, and promotes the more rational use of humanistic care factors in design.}

We review five methods for data gathering, analysis, modeling, and decision-making and compare them with information processing methods for IS planning. Then we develop an IS planning method, an extended version of ‘critical success chains’ (CSC), that supports five of six of the identified information processing needs. We use this method in a project to develop ideas for mobile financial services applications at Digia, a Finland-based R&D firm. We select a group of experts and potential early adopting users. In structured individual interviews, we ask why participants prefer particular specific features the participant would expect to be part of an application. We record this data as linked chains connecting features with consequential performance and with the perceived value of such performance. The data is analyzed across participants to create network models of features, performance, and values. We conduct an ideation workshop with Digia engineers and executives to generate ideas for new systems based on the CSC models. Workshop participants created back-of-the-envelope level ideas for three new applications and business models to show graphically the flow of information, value, and revenue among parties involved in producing and using the applications. We conclude by comparing the extended CSC and other IS planning methods in terms of information theory and the information processing needs for IS planning.}

However, previous research on the scenario-based roadmap has commonly employed a single methodology to develop technology roadmaps, even if the characteristics of layers in technology roadmaps are different. The market planning deals with ‘external scenarios’ which are uncontrollable, whereas the product and technology planning is associated with ‘internal scenarios’ which are controllable. The former is related to the analysis and evaluation, whereas the latter is associated with strategic decision-making. This leads to the important implication that we have to consider two different perspectives of planning and have to utilize two different methodologies. In response, this paper employs an approach using cross impact analysis (CIA) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as a tool for scenario-based roadmapping. CIA is employed for roadmapping the market layer due to its ability to measure the impact of the external environment, whereas AHP is employed to roadmap the technology and product layers, due to its characteristics of decision-making process. To illustrate the working of proposed approach, a case study was conducted for the u-healthcare services.}

This article aims to propose a framework with hybrid approach to capture and evaluate conceptual factors of smart PSS in fuzzy front end. According to service logic that is one of value co-creation paradigms, conceptual factors can be divided into customer needs (CNs) as customer problems to be solved, co-creative value propositions (CVPs) as mutual benefits and system requirements (SRs) as abstract solutions, which just match with three spheres of customer, joint and provider in service logic, respectively. Particularly, CVPs on smart PSS are captured from various interactions in its sequence diagram. As means-end chain theory, three types of conceptual factors for smart PSS are formed into multi-hierarchy network structure, and they are evaluated through a hybrid approach integrating fuzzy DEMATEL, modified-ANP and fuzzy TOPSIS. As a result, SRs prioritization is derived to give support to conceptual design of smart PSS. Sensitivity analysis also is conducted to test reliability of SRs prioritization. Finally, an illustrative case study of smart fridge-service system (SFSS) is demonstrated along this proposed methodological framework.}

The microstructure, physico-mechanical properties and anti-corrosion properties of the GO/MWCNTs/UFP composite coating were studied. By optimizing the GO/MWCNTs content (0.5 wt.% GO/1.0 wt.% MWCNTs), a significant improvement of the alkali resistance and physico-mechanical properties was realized. The morphology of the as-prepared UFP composite films was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM demonstrated that the MWCNTs were well dissolved and covered by the GO. The hardness, adhesion, surface drying time and corrosion resistance of the GO/MWCNTs/UFP composite coating were obviously improved compared to the pure UFP, with a relatively fast surface drying time of 30 min. The hardness and the adhesion grade of the GO/MWCNTs/UFP composite coating (0.5 wt.% GO/1.0 wt.% MWCNTs) reached the highest level of 6H and 1, respectively. When a tinplate was coated with the GO/MWCNTs/UFP composite, the corrosion rate decreased to 1.62 × 10−5 mm/a, and the protection efficiency increased to 99.70%. The resulting GO/MWCNTs/UFP films exhibit outstanding properties in terms of electrochemical corrosion, alkali-resistance, hardness and adhesion, which indicates their high potential for use in applications on offshore steel structures.}

They also explore the organizational factors that facilitate successful processing of market information, and thus offer ideas for better managing the development of new products. The respondents—marketing, R&D, and manufacturing managers from Utah-based computer and medical device manufacturers—provided information about 58 new products, including equal numbers of succeses and failures. The survey responses reveal strong relationships between product success and market information processing, with success most closely linked to information use. In other words, the gathering and sharing of information are important, but only if the information is used effectively. In 80 percent of the product successes studied, the respondents ultimately possessed and used a greater than average amount of market information. And in 75 percent of the failures, the respondents knew less than average about the market at project inception, and gathered or used less than the average amount of market information during the project. For the projects in this study, the integration of marketing, R&D, and manufacturing contributed not only to the sharing and use of information, but also to overall project success. However, the results of the study suggest that the way in which a project is organized plays only an indirect role in determining new product success—most likely by improving the processing of market information. From a managerial perspective, the most important variables identified in the study are market information shared, market information used, and financial success.}

However, in either case market success depends on the degree to which the new product reflects unmet consumer needs. The present study provides a framework, which allows to obtain relevant consumer and expert input in the early stages of functional food development. By systematically generating and rigorously screening a large set of functional food concepts both inside (functional food experts) and outside (consumers) the company, the framework prevents that high potential opportunities are overlooked. This in turn provides a platform for product developers to discuss and decide upon which opportunities to pursue. The illustration of the framework shows the extent to which expert judgements are an accurate reflection of consumer demand.}

Here, a series of novel recyclable tung oil–based polymer coatings based on dual cross-linked dynamic covalent networks were reported. Tung oil polymerized maleic anhydride (TOA) was firstly prepared and further reacted with furfuryl alcohol. Then tung oil-polymerized maleic furanol ester (TOAFA) containing reactive conjugated double bond and carboxyl groups was prepared. FTIR and 1H NMR demonstrated the reactive monomer TOAFA was successfully synthesized. Then TOAFA was cross-linked with bismaleimide and different epoxy resins to fabricate target polymer networks based on dynamic Diels-Alder(D-A) bonds and dynamic transesterification. The shape memory, reprocessing, and mechanical and thermal stability of the copolymerized systems with different crosslinking states were investigated. The coating performances were characterized with solvent resistance, adhesion strength, hardness and glossiness tests. It was found that the dynamic D-A covalent bonds were perfectly combined with transesterification in the polymerization systems. The copolymerized systems possessed excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties. The rigid and flexible properties of the polymer networks can be controlled by adjusting the component weight ratios and the type of epoxy resin in the polymerization system. The rigid polymerization system had the highest tensile strength of 28 MPa, and its elongation at break was up to 57 % of the flexible polymerization system. Coating adhesion test showed the adhesion property reached level 1. The polymer coatings displayed excellent solvent corrosion resistance, and relative high gloss. The polymer networks also showed certain reprocessing performance and excellent shape memory effect.}

However, plastic product markets are undergoing substantial changes due to new factors, such as sustainability and waste reduction, rising petrol and energy prices, and the arrival of new production technologies such as 3D printing. These changes make it necessary to update plastic product design to ensure competitiveness and market success. Several pure optimization strategies have been fully developed for manufacturing process optimization (such as LEAN or KAIZEN methodologies) that are recognized and useful (if not mandatory) in any competitive industry. However, there is a lack of equivalent methodologies being applied to product design optimization, even if a product design review is much more powerful to maximize returns. There are several advantages to an optimization methodology over other strategies, because of its easier implementation and compatibility with any existing organization or design strategy, because it is based on discrete optimization events, with application to the entire product lifecycle (from the early design phase to mature products), maximizing real profitability. The work here is focused on developing a plastic product design optimization methodology with several tools integrated with “variational” information flow to help users detect and evaluate improvements and to make information-based decisions, with the ability to be updated with experience and market changes. The application scope is initially limited to plastic products due to current improvement need, and ensuring deep approach, but also with development opportunities to other markets.}

Searches were refined using Nvivo-10 software, and 101 documents were obtained about theoretical aspects while 17 focused on the application of methods, and these formed the analysis universe. The results show how little concern there is for working comprehensively on human and environmental aspects, and a trend toward segmentation of human and environmental aspects in the field of product/service design and development can be seen, at both concept and application/methodology levels. It was concluded from the above that comprehensive, simultaneous work is needed on human and environmental aspects, clarity and conceptual unity, in order to achieve sustainability in practical matters and ensure that ergoecology-compatible design methods are applied.}

Moreover, when selection criteria are subjective and require decision makers' judgment, and each candidate supplier dominates a separate selection criterion, the decision-making process becomes more complex and traditional DEA models cannot differentiate between potential candidates. In this paper, we propose a multi-method approach based on quantitative empirical investigations, and analytical modeling. We utilize interval type-2 fuzzy sets to quantify decision makers' inputs and propose an extended super-efficiency DEA model, which includes both desirable and undesirable inputs and outputs to evaluate suppliers. This approach simultaneously incorporates sustainability and suppliers' risk factors into the supplier selection problem. The model is developed for both risk-neutral and risk-averse decision-makers. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a real case. Results show that considering sustainability criteria or risk factors separately results in inappropriate decisions.}

The survey was mailed to 1200 managers responsible for manufacturing organisations in Australia. A response rate of 32 per cent was obtained. The quantitative data was analysed using a Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The data analysis revealed that the motivation to adopt CI was related to improved quality conformance, increased productivity, reduced costs, and improvement in delivery reliability. Past experiences of CI were positively correlated with the length of time the process had been in use; the breadth of its application; the percentage of employees actively involved in the program (for operators and non-operators) and training in problem solving. Therefore, the critical implication for managers is that future management development initiatives need to include strategies to assist managers with their understanding of the potential benefits of the CI process, based on “soft” management practices.}

The application of these techniques, including an initial proposal for objective specifications, is addressed within the broader new product introduction context, and benefits described. One-hundred and one customers of SUVs assessed the feel of automotive push switches, completing the tasks both in, and out of vehicles to investigate the effect of context. Using the semantic differential technique, hedonic testing, and content analysis of customers’ verbatim comments, a holistic picture has been built up of what influences the haptic experience. It was found that customers were able to partially discriminate differences in switch-feel, alongside considerations of visual appearance, image, and usability. Three factors named ‘Affective’, ‘Robustness and Precision’, and ‘Silkiness’ explained 61% of the variance in a principle components analysis. Correlations of the factors with acceptance scores were 0.505, 0.371, and 0.168, respectively.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) arena has gained a significant attention in recent years. IoT presents an image of a future internet and recognized as an ecosystem of connected devices, computing mechanisms and other items to exchange data/information cooperate with higher ease and financial benefits. However, IoT adoption and diffusion still remains a challenge due to existence of many challenges. Therefore, this work put forward an objective to recognize and analyze the challenges in implementation of IoT systems in Indian context. Nine challenges to IoT adoption and diffusion were identified by literature survey and experts’ opinions. Further, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approaches were used to analyze the challenges to IoT adoption and diffusion in Indian context. This study may help practitioners and policy makers in removing the hurdles to successful IoT adoption and diffusion. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are presented.}

abstract = {Telescopic forklifts stand apart from other forklift types, boasting numerous benefits. They offer notable advantages, such as enhanced manoeuvrability, accessibility to elevated areas, versatility, and the capacity to operate at high speeds. Choosing appropriate telescopic forklifts can substantially enhance operational efficiency and efficacy within the industry. Concurrently, it can bolster business competitiveness by expediting logistical processes, yielding notable cost reductions. Nonetheless, the intricacy and specificity inherent in these machines complicate the decision-making process for stakeholders. Furthermore, conflicting criteria, the continuous evolution of manufacturers’ models, and the industry’s intricate nature compound the selection challenges. Hence, there is a pressing need for a resilient, dependable, and practical decision-making framework capable of adeptly navigating uncertainties to yield reliable and coherent outcomes. This study aimed to develop an integrated decision-making model based on interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy (IVFF) sets to respond to these requirements and address this critical decision-making problem in the relevant industry, which is also significantly affected by complex uncertainties. This work, therefore, introduces an integrated methodology for decision-making, IVFF–PIPRECIA and IVFF–WISP techniques. IVFF–PIPRECIA determines criteria importance weights, whereas IVFF–WISP identifies optimal alternatives. A case study in the textile industry validates the framework’s practicality. Purchase price emerges as the primary criterion, exceeding 500 thousand euros for telescopic forklifts, followed closely by load-carrying capacity. The second alternative proves to be the best option. Comparative and sensitivity analyses confirm the model’s credibility. The approach effectively handles decision-making uncertainties, yielding competitive outcomes. It can be applied to diverse engineering problems. Insights from this study assist users in selecting optimal equipment and may inform forklift manufacturers in improving machinery. Future research could focus on establishing real-time operational data collection frameworks for these vehicles.}

The initial phase of the study consisted of developing mission and operational requirements for the vehicle. This phase resulted in the assessment that the aircraft should be considered primarily an attack vehicle but with the capability, through reconfiguration, for performing several alternate missions. Evaluation of several high-speed rotorcraft concepts led to the selection of two platform configurations for further study. These included the variable-diameter compound helicopter (VDCH) and the joined-wing tilt rotor (JWTR). Detailed sizing efforts focused on the VDCH as the more feasible of the two concepts. Innovative aspects of the air vehicle include variable-diameter main rotor, turboshaft/turbofan convertible engine, virtual-canopy cockpit, and reconfigurable payload bay. The mission-equipment package is highlighted by an autonomous remote sensor platform. The study identifies areas which best lend themselves to a modular or reconfigurable design approach and describes in detail a candidate vehicle meeting the MRMAAV objectives.}

In order to capture a realistic scenario of considering the geographical characteristics of the suppliers, we assume that the suppliers belong to two regions: the buyer’s region (domestic suppliers) and outside of the buyer’s region (foreign suppliers). Considering this realistic feature, the supply chain might face two types of disruption risk: first, local disruption risks which might uniquely occur inside each supplier such as equipment breakdowns, and second, regional disruption risks that might occur in the region of the suppliers located in the same geographical region such as natural hazards. We formulate the problem considering a risk-neutral decision-maker as a benchmark, and then a risk-averse model is presented. In the latter case, we apply two types of risk assessment tools introduced in the finance literature to analyze the decision maker’s behavior: value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). We show that developed models are non-convex programming, and therefore, we apply the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as the solution approach. We also compare the developed PSO algorithm with the Genetic algorithm (GA) and the commercial GAMS solver to verify the efficiency of the solution method. The computational experiments indicate the impact of the decision maker’s attitude on the supplier selection and the order quantity.}

Owing to the advanced information and communication technologies, Smart PSS development differs from the existing product and/or service design mainly in three aspects: (1) closed-loop design/redesign iteration; (2) value co-creation in the context; and (3) design with context-awareness. These unique characteristics bring up new design challenges, and to the authors' best knowledge, none of the existing design theories can address them well. Aiming to fill this gap, a novel design methodology for the Smart PSS development is proposed based on the information theory, where both the system and stakeholders can be regarded as the information containers. Hence, the closed-loop design/redesign iteration can be treated as the dynamic change of information and entropy in a balanced ecosystem. Meanwhile, the value co-creation process is considered as the exchange of accumulated information via the container. Lastly, the design context-awareness represents the process of reducing entropy. As a novel prescriptive design theory, it follows Shannon’s information theory to determine the best design/redesign solutions by considering the three characteristics integrally. It is hoped that the proposed design entropy theory can largely facilitate today's Smart PSS development with better performance and user satisfaction.}

Thirteen (13) candidate natural based fiber materials for the hybridization process were selected and analyzed to determine their overall scores in three (3) main performance indices according to the component product design specifications. Using the AHP method, the kenaf bast fiber yields the highest scores and was selected as the best candidate material to formulate the hybrid polymer composites for the automotive component construction. Sensitivity analysis was also performed and results show that kenaf bast fiber emerged as the best candidate material in two out of three simulated scenarios, which further validates the results gained through the AHP method.}

This paper suggests that this is the result of market failure stemming from two factors: the first is that information asymmetry prevents the establishment of software quality prior to purchase; whilst the second is that the legal provisions available under private law are unable in their current form to adequately address software liability issues. On that basis this paper proposes the use of standardisation as a tool to address both of these shortcomings by providing an industry benchmark against which software quality can be ascertained, as well as forming a legal tool for determining causation for the purposes of establishing legal liability.}

abstract = {Energy surplus has always been problematic in isolated and countryside areas of the globe, both monetarily and technically. Prioritizing energy sources to electrify a rural hamlet is the most challenging stage. Because no one option is perfect, pooling resources is always a good idea. The combination of monetary, technological, and eco-friendly factors in planned decision-making complicates building an independent off-grid source of electricity. Due to their cheap cost and low noise, standalone solar systems have been seen as viable and rapidly developing green energy sources, particularly for rural electrification. However, these systems' lowest energy conversion and highest capital expenses are their principal drawbacks. As a result, numerous factors should be considered before installing the system, including PV panel types and configurations, PV module mathematical models, storage batteries, environmental requirements, sizing strategy based on techno-economic objectives, and final design choices. This research aims to present a method for choosing the optimum solar panel for rural electrification based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) strategy. The SPs are associated with various characteristics, like Cost Per Watt, INR (SPC-1), and Nameplate Max. Power rating; Watt (SPC-2), Vmax; Volts (SPC-3), Imax; Amperes (SPC-4), Voc; Volts (SPC-5), Isc; Amperes (SPC-6), Panel; efficiency(%) (SPC-7), Number of cells: quantity (SPC-8) and Weight;kg (SPC-9). The SPC-1 and SPC-9 are nonbeneficial criteria, and the SPC-2 to SPC-8 are beneficial criteria. As a result, the TOPSIS procedure is applied to choose the optimum option out of the 16 options. For equal weight, the MCS value is 0.626, whereas the entropy weight approach has an MCS value of 0.817. Following that, using the TOPSIS technique, SP-12 ranks second in alternatives. If the first option isn't available on the market, the second can be chosen.}

In this regard, sustainable development plays a crucial role in striking a balance between the demands of social productivity and the reserves of natural resources. In the realm of sustainable development, life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important tool to assist in ensuring proper sustainability through assessing the environmental impacts of product designs. Unlike previous reviews, which mainly focus on LCA methodology, this paper presents LCA related studies from the perspective of product development applications. In this article, the approach on how LCA can be used in product development is introduced step by step, from concept design, part design, and process design to decision making. The applications of LCA come in different forms such as impact assessment, selection, classification and decision support. The issues or challenges with respect to the four steps of LCA (i.e. goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact analysis, and interpretation) have been examined and investigated. Corresponding models and theories for coping with these challenges are reviewed. In particular, widespread and popular analytical tools are identified and highlighted. Considering the vague measurement of environmental impact in an agile manufacturing system, it is suggested that the development of LCA should keep pace with the advancing complex product development system. Overall, this article sheds light on the trend of LCA applications in sustainable product development and provides the prospect of promising research directions for LCA researchers and practitioners.}

Selecting the right suppliers for different product items requires an appropriate problem framing and a suitable approach. Despite the vast literature on this topic, there is not a comprehensive framework underlying the supplier selection process that addresses those concerns. This paper formalizes a framework that provides guidance on how supplier selection should be formulated and approached for different types of items segmented in Kraljic’s portfolio matrix and production policies. The framework derives from a thorough literature review, which explores the main dimensions in supplier selection, including sourcing strategy, decision scope and environment, selection criteria, and solution approaches. 326 papers, published from 2000 to 2021, were reviewed for said purpose. The results indicate that supplier selection regarding items with a high purchasing importance should lead to holistic selection criteria. In addition, items comprising a high complexity of supply and production activities should require integrated selection and different sources of uncertainty associated with decision scope and environment, respectively, to solve it, as well as hybrid approaches. There are still many research opportunities in the supplier selection area, particularly in the integrated selection problems and hybrid solution methods, as well as in the risk mitigation, sustainability goals, and new technology adoption.}

Initially developed GBRS were often criticized for not being holistic and region-specific. Hence, many researchers are involved in developing a holistic system incorporating environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability respecting the requirements of specific countries. However, limited studies exist, considering the region-specific needs, especially in a country like India with a diversified climatic setting within. Therefore, the current study attempts to establish a hierarchy tree for assessing sustainability, focusing on residential buildings of the tropical climatic region of India. An in-depth review of GBRS and published literature succeeded by expert interviews established the hierarchy tree with eleven categories classified under three basic sustainability dimensions. Further, the perception of stakeholders was recorded and the collected data was analyzed using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to determine the priority weight of sustainability dimensions and categories. The stakeholders perceived approximately equal weight for all the three dimensions with slightly higher weight for the environmental dimension. The results also highlight the relevance of the social and economic dimensions in a developing country like India. The categories ‘Energy efficiency’ and ‘Environmental quality and well-being’ received the highest weight under environmental and social dimensions, respectively. The hierarchy tree proposed would remain as a reference for assessing building sustainability in the tropical climate. Moreover, the methodology proposed would serve as a base for developing other region-specific systems.}

PD integrates “hard” properties (engineering), with “soft” properties (industrial design). Fundamental PD characteristics are: Iteration, Integration (technical and organizational), and Innovation. Globally distributed industrial partners co-operate using Internet. Iteration: process loops are speeded up by modeling/simulation, virtual prototyping and additive manufacturing. Structured PD: Initial specification of “what” – functional requirements, then “how” - generation of design solutions. Interdependencies analysis is important to simplify the product's structure. The V-model for specification and verification is commonly used. A 3-stage industrial process separates strategy, core technology development, and product design for market introduction.}

Certain strategies and some specific technologies are required to create such an environment. For instance, effective reuse of enterprise knowledge is a key strategic component of IP3D. To reuse the knowledge, however, we must first capture and maintain it in a persistent manner and then disseminate and share it in a practical manner throughout the development cycle. To do this task efficiently, we need technologies and protocols to define a communication dictionary and implement a user-friendly access interface. In part one [Rezayat M., Computer Aided Design 2000;32:85–96], we showed that such technologies and protocols must be Web-based because of its open standards, ease of use, and ubiquity. In this paper, we review one IP3D strategy referred to as Knowledge-Based Product Development (KBPD) and then take a close look at one Web-based technology, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), for defining the required interfaces. We also propose use of Key Characteristics (KCs) as a main enabler for defining the ontology. Some examples and scenarios demonstrate the use of KCs and XML as key components for implementation of a KBPD system.}

abstract = {Design guidelines as a knowledge documentation form is no longer a new topic in industry and science. The first one was already developed in 1954, and since then their number has been growing steadily. Today, design guidelines are published in numerous books, publications and specialist articles on various topics. Through the successful dissemination of design guidelines for traditional materials in industry, this concept of knowledge documentation was also adopted identically for fibre-reinforced plastics. However, there is a significant difference between designing with isotropic classical metals and anisotropic fibre-reinforced plastics. With the latter, the freedom of design is significant greater what allows individual design solutions and thus increases the complexity of design process. This, in turn, places different demands and expectations on design guidelines for this group of materials. The comprehensive analysis as well as interviews with industrial representatives showed, that current design guidelines for fiber-reinforced plastics do not meet the requirements of the industry. Some important aspects, which have a significant influence on product properties and therefore have to be considered in design, are missing holistically. Design guidelines are formulated in a general way similar to those for classic metals, which at most leads to the acquisition of general knowledge but allows not sufficiently its application in specific situations. Furthermore, there is no uniform specification as to how the knowledge should be documented in design guidelines in order to ensure their benefits through the application. This leads to different documentation forms, structure and depth of detail. This paper presents requirements on design guidelines for fibre-reinforced plastics in order to facilitate a good knowledge transfer in industrial fields of application and proposes a solution for a knowledge management system, which supports design engineers in different product development processes by providing relevant situation-specific information.}

abstract = {To effectively address the requirements of deeply coexisting-cooperative-cognitive (Tri-Co) interactions among humans, robots, and the environment within the context of Industry 4.0, it becomes crucial to conduct evaluation research on Tri-Co capabilities (TCCs) of collaborative robots (cobots), which is a knowledge-intensive task. However, existing research on performance evaluation of cobots has not yet established a common method for constructing a complete performance evaluation index system. The testing methods lack a design basis and fail to evaluate the performance of cobots through operational tasks in industrial production or daily life from the perspective of test tasks. Furthermore, these methods do not facilitate the fusion of multi-source subjective and objective decision-making information, which includes both the knowledge of experts and fundamental parameters of cobots. To this end, this study proposes a multi-source decision-making information fusion framework for evaluating the TCCs of cobots. This framework includes a construction method for an evaluation index system that fuses subjective and objective elements based on statistics, text clustering, and closed-loop feedback mechanism. It also incorporates TCCs test tasks, and an improved fuzzy analytic network process (IFANP). Additionally, it incorporates a combination weighting method that aims to minimise both subjective and objective weights deviations. This framework effectively integrates the subjective knowledge of experts with the objective fundamental parameters of cobots. It accomplishes local TCCs evaluation from the perspective of test tasks. Additionally, it achieves global TCCs evaluation by combining basic performance evaluation indices and the performance of completing the test tasks. A case by Rethink Sawyer (Sawyer) is presented to demonstrate the application process and viability of the developed framework. The experimental results and calculation examples indicate that the research has the potential to provide a certain theoretical basis and reference to solve the performance testing and evaluation issues for other types of robots in engineering applications.}

Sixty participants were recruited, and 24 experimental squatting toilets were simulated by comparing the inner shape, frame, antiskid design, and size of the most comfortable squatting posture for each toilet, plus the subjective comfort evaluation. The results showed a significant sex difference in squatting toilets. The comfortable outward angle between the feet was 40.56° and 28.99° in men and women, respectively. The inner shape only impacted the SBF, while irregular frames resulted in a higher OSI than square frames. In terms of subjective perception, O-shaped internal structures and square frames were the most popular. The SBF of the natural squatting positions of men and women can provide a reference for the design of an optimal squatting toilet.}

abstract = {In this study, a two-phase algorithm has been developed to address the single-product supplier selection and order allocation problem (SP-SSOAP). In the first phase, a novel demand allocation algorithm is developed using a recursive demand equation. Subsequently, an adaptive genetic algorithm is employed in the second phase, with additional constraints for capacity and minimum order quantity, to determine the best lot-sizing plan for each supplier. Experimental results demonstrate that, on average, the proposed heuristic achieves an objective value within 1% of the optimal solution for small-sized instances and outperforms the previous heristic solution by an average of 12% in terms of objective value for larger problems. Additionally, the numerical results emphasize that the proposed method performs better when input parameters such as price, ordering cost, and holding cost exhibit lower fluctuations. This suggests that managers should focus on improving supplier relationships and coordination strategies to reduce variability in price, order cost, and holding cost.}

Researchers and practitioners have proposed many frameworks to deal with variety of challenges along PSS lifecycle. However, despite the common sense of four fundamental constituent components of PSS-products, services, supported network and supported infrastructures, majority of them only focus on collaborative design of products and services, and few of them attach importance to supported network. The framework we proposed in this paper introduces the Three-Dimensional Concurrent Engineering (3DCE), which is widely recognized in product design field, into PSS design, in order to achieve the integrated product service offerings, processes and supported network design, hoping to bridge the gap of supported network design in a PSS. Meanwhile, this framework adopts Virtual Enterprise (VE) as a manifestation of supported network in order to provide the system with variety of skills, resources and supported infrastructures in an effective and dynamic way. What’s more, due to the increasing significances of customers, this framework takes both customers’ requirements and providers’ requirements into consideration, and is dedicated to address a win-win solution for both with the help of PSS design and assessment techniques.}

abstract = {Best-worst method (BWM) is an efficient multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method. This paper puts forward two decision-making methods with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) BWM (IF-BWM). Firstly, a new consistency definition of IF-BWM is presented. To comprehensive reflect the consistency level of original IF preference comparisons, an acceptable input-and-output-based consistency ratio (CR) of IF-BWM preference comparisons is defined to measure the consistency level of IF-BWM preference comparisons. A goal linear programming model is built to improve the consistency level of input-based CR from the original IF-BWM preference comparisons. To induce an optimal multiplicative normalized IF weight vector (IFWV), a programming model is set up. Accordingly, a novel individual IF-BWM is proposed. Using the deviation between IF values, an analytic expression of determining experts' weights is formulated. By minimizing the weighted deviation between individual multiplicative normalized IFWVs and group multiplicative normalized IFWV, a programming model is built to determine the optimal group multiplicative normalized IFWV. Subsequently, a novel group IF-BWM is put forward. Two real-life examples are furnished to reveal the validity of proposed individual IF-BWM and group IF-BWM in practice. In view of theoretical aspect, this paper fosters the theory of IF-BWM by firstly proposing an input-based CR, output-based CR, an acceptable input-and-output-based CR and group IF-BWM. The model of improving CR of IF-BWM preference comparisons is initially discussed. This paper has a certain guiding significance for the following research on IF-BWM and provides a novel perspective for an MADM problem with positive and negative preference information.}

This paper introduces an approach to product definition by evolving from similar existing products. Our methodology is derived from recognizing functional requirement (FR) patterns from past design efforts including FR topology, FR classification, and FR templates. A two-phase methodology of FR pattern recognition and pattern adoption is presented in the paper. The proposed approach not only eases the tedious elaboration process of requirement definition among customers, marketers, and designers, but also reduces the complexities and risks inherent in requirement specification. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for incorporating expert heuristics into FR patterns based on competitive products and technological trends. A case study conducted in power supply design helps to illustrate the feasibility and potential of the proposed approach.}
