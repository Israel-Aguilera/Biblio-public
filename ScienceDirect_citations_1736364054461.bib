abstract = {The goal of the City of Quality system is to provide a group support system (GSS) for strategic planning of large-scale system development projects—a GSS which can significantly enhance these projects by providing tools for detailed requirements management, modeling, and analysis. It is an adaptation and implementation, using hypertext, of an ensemble of Japanese management techniques. The name of these techniques translates, roughly, as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), which is part of Total Quality Management (TQM). These manual techniques have been developed over a number of years as a response to the problems of developing large, complex systems that must satisfy conflicting requirements. They can be an important strategic planning tool. When successfully applied, QFD can save 50 percent of the system development costs; however, many organizations find it difficult to apply QFD successfully. Decision support system (DSS) and GSS technology can help address this problem. Hypertext tools allow the development of a low-cost DSS implementation to support QFD. This DSS can be extended to a GSS with network management software.}

The design methodology is called ICDM – Integrated, Customer Driven, Conceptual Design Method. Three out of the new ICDM tools are shortly described in this paper. These tools are the Enriched QFD for task definition, the CFMA – Conceptual Failure Mode Analysis and the DQM – Design Quality Measurement to evaluate the satisfaction from the generated concepts. The other new tools like the CDTC – the Conceptual Design To Cost, the Roobustool – to evaluate and improve the robustness of the solution combination, the RTA – the Risk and Time to Market Analysis and the DSO - the Direct Synthesis Optimization, are only shortly mentioned. ICDM has been used extensively in many Israeli start-up companies and also in classical industrial companies that adapted the method to their special needs.}

abstract = {This study focused on groundwater quality around a gold mine at the border between the Phichit and Phetchabun provinces by investigating hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics and performing a multivariate analysis to determine the impact of natural and anthropogenic processes on groundwater quality. Groundwater samples were collected from 47 wells in the summer and rainy seasons, and hydrochemical parameters were measured on-site and analyzed in a laboratory. The hydrogeologic characteristics of the study area can be categorized into Quaternary floodplain deposits (Qfd), terrace deposits (Qt), weathered fractures volcanic rocks (Vw), volcanic rocks (Vf), and massive volcanic rocks (Vm). According to the Piper Diagram, water types in the summer season are Ca-Na-HCO3 (34.29%), Ca-HCO3 (22.86%), and Na-HCO3 (22.86%), whereas the rainy season primarily features Na-HCO3 (44.74%), and Ca-Na-HCO3 (39.47%). The principal component analysis (PCA) produced seven significant components that explained 71.50% of the cumulative variance. We divide primary contributors to groundwater into two groups. PC1–PC5 (from natural processes) include Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Al (mineral components of potassium feldspar and plagioclase feldspar), Fe, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ (associated minerals, such as sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), and pyrite (FeS2)), and inclusions in gold ore (low sulfidation epithermal gold deposits). The second source, PC6 and PC7 (mainly from human activities), includes NO3−, and, PO43− from fertilizers in agricultural areas and wastewater discharge from residential areas. This study revealed that natural and anthropogenic processes affected the hydrochemistry of groundwater, but natural processes played a greater role.}

In order to implement an ERP project successfully, it is necessary to select an ERP system which can be aligned with the needs of the company. Thus, a robust decision making approach for ERP software selection requires both company needs and characteristics of the ERP system and their interactions to be taken into account. This paper develops a novel decision framework for ERP software selection based on quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy linear regression and zero–one goal programming. The proposed framework enables both company demands and ERP system characteristics to be considered, and provides the means for incorporating not only the relationships between company demands and ERP system characteristics but also the interactions between ERP system characteristics through adopting the QFD principles. The presented methodology appears as a sound investment decision making tool for ERP systems as well as other information systems. The potential use of the proposed decision framework is illustrated through an application.}

In the current business situation, enterprises are converging to a point where they need to be smarter, faster, flexible, and more reactive to changes in order to sustain in the demanding market. Competitiveness urges the companies towards agile practices in a determined manner. Agility can be achieved by improving the relationship between buyer and suppliers in a supply chain. Identifying appropriate approaches to create an agile supply chain is one of the best ideas that can help companies making a successful changeover to an agile enterprise so that they can sustain and prosper in the market for the long run. Accommodating market changes and triggering response strategies is quite challenging and to meet this challenge we use a structured model known as Agile Supply Chain Transformation Matrix (ASCTM). ASCTM can relate the business changes with suitable approaches for supply chain configuration and supplier-buyer relationship establishment and decides the business processes and infrastructures needed to support agility. The main purpose of this paper is to propose the ASCTM which aims for the creation of an agile enterprise. ASCTM tool is constructed with the help of modern Quality function deployment (QFD) tool for identifying and iterating business practices and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which has proved a successful Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)tool in modern day manufacturing.}

Failing development projects, however, are caused by insufficient and incorrect acquisition and handling of requirements due to frequent changes and complexity in product systems. Shortening development time and time-to-market must therefore be reached by homogenization of the development process. To address this situation adequately, this contribution presents a holistic agile matrix-based approach. Using specific elements from Weber et al.’s CPM/PDD and Akao’s QFD, the gap between customer domain and developers state of view is overcome by defining correlation and weighting matrices, which are mutually defined by both parties during the development process and supported by IT-based environments. The foundation is given by a mathematical-physical database containing scientific and logical coherences providing universal correlations between customer requirements and system-characteristics. This contribution presents the sector-independent approach concerning acquisition and transformation of requirements, including an automotive example for validation.}

In addition, we have used AHP to determine the weighted importance of various stakeholders and the intensity of the relationship between the variables involved in the model. The recommendations of the model are more or less validated by the actual force composition currently deployed in Bosnia. The advantage of the model is to add “fine tuning” and precision to an otherwise ad hoc decision making process concerning the deployment of armed forces. The model can be used in other force composition planning scenarios.}

The approach supports the integration of the human behaviour of the workers aiming to assess the risks arising from human misbehaviour in the man-machine interaction. Modifying the well-known “house of quality”, the basic design tool of the management approach known as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), the risk priority number (RPN) of the risks due to the human misbehaviour and their inter-correlated domino effects are evaluated considering the severity, detectability and occurrence criteria that are weighted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Thereafter, the safety protective devices, that are most effective to manage the risks due to the human behaviour in the man-machine interaction, are selected on the basis of the RPN and their correlated effectiveness. The proposed approach is applied to an ordinary maintenance activity on a fruit and vegetable hot refiner. The effectiveness and usefulness of the original methodology for the selection of the most effective technical solutions to mitigate the risks due to the human misbehaviour are presented in the provided case study.}

Enterprise architecture (EA) by breaking down the organization’s systems to its components and determining the relationship between them in different layers offers an appropriate solution for understanding and investigating relationships and processes of organizations which develop strategies and information technology plans. This paper proposes a conceptual model for enterprise IT architecture. For this purpose, conceptual and reference models of enterprise architecture are investigated and key concepts of them are described. By identifying dimensions of reviewed models, key dimensions of the proposed model are extracted and by using Shannon’s entropy, weight and priority of each dimension is determined. In order to determine building blocks of each dimension, a mapping has been established between customer and functional requirements by using axiomatic method and relations between customer and functional requirements has been validated by experts’ opinions using Quality Function Development (QFD) method. Proposed model has been described by determining goals, components and relations. Then the model is validated by surveying experts. Finally an Iranian telecommunication enterprise is selected for a case study and the model is tested there and promoting solutions are proposed to improve the status of the organization for implementing the model.}

As an element of a graduate course in spacecraft system engineering, its purpose was primarily educational — to allow the students to apply their knowledge in a real mission study. The second purpose was to investigate the feasibility of applying advanced technology (the power antenna and solar electric propulsion concepts) to a challenging mission. Finally, the study allowed evaluation of the benefits of using quality-oriented techniques (Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Taguchi Methods) for a mission study. To encourage innovation, several constraints were placed on the study from the onset. While the primary goal was to place at least one lander on Europa, the additional constraint of no nuclear power sources posed an additional challenge, particularly when coupled with the mass constraints imposed by using a Delta II class launch vehicle. In spite of these limitations, the team was able to develop a mission and spacecraft design capable of carrying three simple, lightweight, yet capable landers. The science return will more than adequately meet the science goals established QFD was used to determine the optimal choice of instrumentation. The lander design was selected from several competing lander concepts, including rovers. The carrier design was largely dictated by the needs of the propulsion system required to support the mission, although the development of a Project Trades Model (PTM) in software allowed for rapid recalculation of key system parameters as changes were made. Finally, Taguchi Methods (Design of Experiments) were used in conjunction with the PTM allowing for some limited optimization of design features.}

Despite huge development in prediction of solar radiation data, there is a gap in extraction of pertinent information from such data. Hence the available data cannot be effectively utilized for engineering application. This is acting as a barrier for the emerging technology. For making accurate engineering and financial calculations regarding any solar energy project, it is crucial to identify and optimize the most significant statistic(s) representing insolation availability by the Photovoltaic setup at the installation site. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique has been applied for identifying the statistic(s), which are of high significance from a project designer's point of view. A MATLAB™ program has been used to build the annual frequency distribution of hourly insolation over any module plane at a given location. Descriptive statistical analysis of such distributions is done through MINITABTM. For Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) installation, similar statistical analysis has been carried out for the composite frequency distribution, which is formed by weighted summation of insolation distributions for different module planes used in the installation. Vital most influential statistic(s) of the composite distribution have been optimized through Artificial Neural Network computation. This approach is expected to open up a new horizon in BIPV system design.}

After collecting the starting information based on references, the consultation to 21 experts, and the characteristics of these enclosures included in regulations, standards and recommendations in Spain, and also after applying the methodology mentioned above, the results showed that air conditioning (13.6/100), the thermal insulation of the room (11.9/100), windows (10.5/100), dimensions of spaces (10.2/100), and humidity (10.1/100) are the most influential factors. Within the scope of medical emergency services, those triage, consultation, examination, treatment, and observation rooms fulfilling what is specified by Spanish regulations, standards and recommendations obtained positive assessments (≥3/5) in most cases. It was therefore concluded that this methodology is of great interest to assess generally the suitability of indoor enclosures to use infrared thermography cameras, and regarding the specific case of the main enclosures of medical emergency services fulfilling with Spanish standards and recommendations, their characteristics make them suitable for using infrared thermography cameras, at least in relation to the fulfilment of basic conditions.}

The results showed that among the main factors “government green decision making” is the most influential and “quality” is the most susceptible factor. The highest weight allocates to “customer satisfaction”. The results of house of quality showed that the “convenient and appropriate logistics services” ranked as first, the “implementation of transportation infrastructure for green policies” ranked as second, “having the necessary expertise and experience in similar industries” ranked third which reflects the importance of these requirements comparing to other requirements.

In order to maximize the success of a product, the customers’ wishes need to be integrated into the entire product design process. The design of a mechatronic system can be divided in a 3 different phases, requirements engineering, architectural design and detailed design. During the requirement phase, customers needs are translated into engineering characteristics. In the architectural phase, the topology, consisting of the number and type of components, as well as some key properties (size, material) of the different components, is chosen. This phase has a major impact on the final product performance. Since (mechatronic) products need to meet an ever increasing number of performance specifications and constraints, recently computational design synthesis approaches have been developed to support design engineers. These types of methods use computational power and computer models to search the design space in an automatic way. However, as these methods focus entirely on maximizing the functional performance, the customers’ actual wishes and needs may slip to the background. This article presents a novel computational design synthesis approach which integrates design space exploration and Quality Function Deployment during the architectural design phase. The proposed method allows to generate architectures that maximize customer satisfaction. The effectiveness is illustrated by an industrial case study: the design of the mechanical architecture for a washing machine.}

abstract = {Transportation plays a major role in the economic growth and development of a country. In the Philippines, where roads are smaller, narrower and often congested, tricycle population has increased considerably. People ride tricycles primarily due to lack of alternative mode of transportation and convenience, giving the advantage of speed and cost. However, riding a tricycle has several disadvantages and discomfort. The body of the tricycle is deemed too small, but passengers are cramped inside to maximize the number of passengers per trip. The challenge in the past and now is how to minimize the negative impact caused by these vehicles, while continuing to meet the daily transport demands of a growing population. As support to environmental initiatives, several electric tricycle (e-trike) projects have been undertaken in different parts of the Philippines, one of which is the e-trike project initiated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This paper presents: (1) an improved e-trike design that provides a comfortable and safe riding experience for all its passengers and (2) a sustainable system for its operation, maintainability and adoption, using ergonomic principles to improve on the current design of the e-trike in the Philippines. Study areas include National Capital Region (NCR) and Southern Luzon, within low and middle-class population. The design improvements for the e-trike are classified into three major factors: (1) functionality, (2) safety and (3) comfort. These proposed changes are developed by using customer requirements gathered from the survey, identifying optimal conditions using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and TRIZ methodologies, and using Value Engineering (VE) approach in analyzing design functions and generating better and more innovative designs. Ergonomics is also utilized as a vital tool to align pre-determined human factors with existing and proposed specifications.}

A structured and objective method for collecting the user's quality requirements was developed and a subjective evaluation test session was performed for collecting the cyclists’ evaluation of different wheels models. The correlation coefficients were calculated adopting the Pearson's coefficients computation method. The results didn’t show any inconsistency and the high and the low correlation coefficients agreed with the expected analysis of the bicycle riding dynamics.

However, there is a misalignment between sustainable practices and organisations' strategies and capabilities, especially when sustainability requirements of the stakeholders changes over time. Grounded in dynamic capability view (DCV), this paper addresses the changes in supply chain sustainability requirements of stakeholders in the context of sourcing products from apparel manufacturers in a low cost country Bangladesh. To this end, this study develops a decision support (DS) framework for supply chain sustainability (SCS) that identifies and prioritises optimal strategies for SCS in a dynamic environment. This study adopts a mixed method approach, with the qualitative approach being a field study, and the quantitative approach using fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (QFD) integrated optimisation technique. Our DS framework addresses the stakeholders' sustainability requirements over time in the context of a case company. The findings show that concomitant with the changes in the stakeholders' priorities of the sustainability requirements, the organisational sustainability practices, strategies and capabilities also change over time. The SCS DS framework brings a richer conceptual understanding of the dynamic changes in stakeholder requirements and allow managers to choose and select optimal strategies and make astute decisions whilst balancing the economic, social and environmental viability simultaneously.}

QFD is a management technique aimed at facilitating companywide quality control which has proven valuable in the fields of manufacturing and service production. Because we recognize several issues in common with these fields and information systems (IS) development, it is thought to be a worthwhile effort to apply QFD to IS development as well. We try to make our approach somewhat more realistic by applying it in a hypothetical manner to an actual case; and the benefits and drawbacks of the technique learned during the process are reported. Our impression is that QFD has features which help the participants to understand each other's requirements; a prerequisite of producing ISs which takes into consideration the different quality requirements of the parties involved.}

This article details an approach to determine which molecular methods instrument most closely meets the Microbial Monitoring System (MMS) requirements for use on the ISS.

A robust evaluation method should consider the interrelationships among customer needs and PTRs while determining the importance levels of PTRs in the HOQ. This paper employs the analytic network process (ANP) to fulfill this requirement. Furthermore, the proposed analytic procedure should take into account the multi-objective nature of the problem, and thus, incorporate other goals such as cost, extendibility and manufacturability of PTRs. This paper presents a zero–one goal programming methodology that includes importance levels of PTRs derived using the ANP, cost budget, extendibility level and manufacturability level goals to determine the PTRs to be considered in designing the product.

Technology substitution and process innovation require the evaluation of the trade-offs among environmental impact, cost, and engineering performance attributes. General impact assessment methodologies, decision analysis and management tools, and optimization methods commonly used in engineering cannot efficiently address the issues needed for such evaluation. The conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) process often generates results that can be subject to multiple interpretations, although the advantages of the LCA concept and framework obtain wide recognition. In the present work, the LCA concept is integrated with Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a popular industrial quality management tool, which is used as the framework for the development of our integrated model. The problem of weighting is addressed by using pairwise comparison of stakeholder preferences. Thus, this paper presents a new integrated analytical approach, Integrated Industrial Ecology Function Deployment (I2-EFD), to assess the environmental behavior of alternative technologies in correlation with their performance and economic characteristics. Computer display technology is used as the case study to further develop our methodology through the modification and integration of various quality management tools (e.g., process mapping, prioritization matrix) and statistical methods (e.g., multi-attribute analysis, cluster analysis). Life cycle thinking provides the foundation for our methodology, as we utilize a published LCA report, which stopped at the characterization step, as our starting point. Further, we evaluate the validity and feasibility of our methodology by considering uncertainty and conducting sensitivity analysis.}

A lot of investigations have been published in the supplier selection area and it has been notified that in the majority of these publications supplier selection and evaluation and development have the same meaning. However, one needs integrated models to cover all of these stages. In addition, most of the proposed models focused on manufacturing environments and a few papers have been allocated for service industries. To our knowledge, no Internet service provider (ISP) selection and evaluation has been published up to now. In this paper, we propose a new framework on the basis of company’s strategy for supplier management including supplier selection, evaluation, and development. In the first phase, quality function deployment (QFD) is utilized to rank the best ISPs based on qualitative criteria. Then, a quantitative model is adopted to consider quantitative metrics. Finally, we compose two models and select the best ISPs. In the next phase, we propose a novel algorithm to evaluate selected ISPs from three perspectives: customer, performance, and competition. Meanwhile, the fuzzy logic and triangular fuzzy numbers are utilized to deal with vagueness of human thought. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to illustrate the stages of ISP selection and evaluation. The implementation of the proposed model is easy and do not need optimization background.}

However, lack of quantitative data and undefined relationships between the attributes makes it difficult to develop a quantitative model for analyzing subjective customer satisfaction (CS) attributes. While researchers and practitioners have accomplished a significant success in terms of developing tool such as quality function deployment (QFD) to capture the voice of customers, and mathematical models for selecting engineering design alternatives, there is limited precedence in terms of prior works on customer satisfaction driven quality improvement target planning and prioritization of customer satisfaction attributes for target planning. This paper presents a fuzzy set theory based analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) framework for prioritizing CS attributes in target planning. Furthermore, unlike prior QFD papers, we consider a broad range of strategic and tactical factors for determining the weights. These weights are then incorporated into target planning by identifying the gap in the current CS level. A case example from automotive industry is presented to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed methodology. The framework has been implemented on MS Excel® so that the industry can easily adopt it with limited amount of training and at no additional software cost.}

abstract = {Current service robots have relatively primitive behaviours and limited interaction with the environment. Technological foresights have indicated that the next generation of service robots will demonstrate a high degree of autonomy and reliability, have minimal impact on the environment, and will interact in a flexible way with the user. It is necessary therefore, to determine the functional requirements for a future energy-efficient robotic bioproduction system from the perspective of various stakeholders, together with the development of a high-level framework for designing and prototyping the common functionalities of mobile robots. This study presents technical guidelines for the design of a plant nursing robot. The methodology uses Quality Function Deployment (QFD) functionalities involving the identification of relationships between identified user requirements and the derived design parameters. Extracted important user requirements included: 1) adjustable to row distance and parcel size, 2) profitable, 3) minimize damage to crops, and 4) reliable. Lower ratings were attributed to requirements such as: 1) affection value, prestige, 2) look attractive, 3) out of season operations, and 4) use of renewable energy. Subsequent important derived design parameters included: 1) PreparedForModularTools, 2) ControlableByExternalModules, 3) SemiAutonomous, and 4) Local- and GlobalPositioningSystem. The least important design parameters included: 1) OpenStandardSoftware, 2) Well-builtAppearance, 3) WheelsWithInfiniteSteeringRotation, and 4) InternalSafetySystem.

abstract = {Enhancing the sustainability of food packaging (FP) is challenging due to the conflicting environmental and functional requirements, even though it leads to many negative environmental impacts over different life cycle phases. Sustainable FP aims to strike a balance in fulfilling protection, facilitation of handling, and communication functions while minimizing the environmental impacts and economic costs. Yet, there is a lack of holistic frameworks that support sustainable FP design decision-making processes based on life cycle thinking. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop a generalizable framework combining life cycle thinking with functional analysis for systematically and holistically comparing sustainable packaging design options, considering environmental, economic, and consumer preference dimensions. The proposed approach was applied to a rigid plastic packaging case study involving ketchup bottles. Kano's theory and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) were used to identify the user requirements, applicable design features, and prioritisation. Then, conjoint analysis, life cycle analysis (LCA), and analytical cost estimation were used to estimate the functional satisfaction, environmental impact, and costs incurred respectively. Finally, the values obtained for three criteria were aggregated using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the overall sustainability of the design options was compared. The results show that both material quantity, type, and shape majorly influence the functional, environmental, and economic impacts. There is a disparity between the options with the highest functional satisfaction and the lowest environmental impacts respectively. The aggregated score indicates that an option currently available in the market has the highest performance, and yet there are other options with better environmental performance. However, even after the scores are aggregated, the inputs of packaging experts maybe necessary to successfully balance the sustainability requirements with the user expectations. The findings of this research, which proposes a systematic and holistic design process, can support packaging designers, industry decision-makers, and policy planners in enhancing the sustainability of FP.}

As a point of departure, platform-based design is defined as shared logic in a company's activities, and a “function-based” leveraging strategy is employed to identify non-assembled products with similar characteristics and commonalities among product families, related production processes and raw materials. It is proposed that a production platform philosophy and platform-based design of non-assembled products should rely on Product platforms, Process platforms and Raw-material platforms that are well-integrated into common Production platforms, in an end-to-end perspective. However, platform-based design of non-assembled products may differ depending on whether company production relies solely on a captive raw material base or on purchased raw materials on the open market, or on both. The congruence of the development of Production platforms with the QFD methodology and House of Quality was noted in this study, as well as the simplicity of using the methodology on homogeneous products compared to multi-level hierarchical assembled products. It is argued that the proposed conceptual framework can be used in internal company discussions and reviews whether and how such an approach in product innovation can be a fruitful avenue to explore and adapt.}

abstract = {The development process of composite structures has suffered from a lack of balance between analysis, design and the use of design methods. This study finds a solution to this matter with an alternative proposal that aims at substituting with a stiffer and lighter material the aluminum alloy originally employed in the construction of the primary structure of a micro satellite (50 kg). The structural components to be substituted are the four vertical lateral walls (VLWs) fabricated as honeycomb sandwich structures (SS). The alternative structure consists of a carbon fiber-epoxy (C-Ep) laminate whose stacking sequence is chosen so it is configured as quasi-isotropic, balanced, regular, homogeneous and symmetrical. The alternative proposal is justified from the standpoint of the feasibility of C-Ep in space applications; the reduction of the launch cost; and the enhancement of the structural performance. The first aspect is verified with a state-of-the-art review. Launch cost reduction is estimated conjecturally based on launch prices of the Ariane family of rockets. The development process of the C-Ep laminate is carried out from start to finish with an integral design process based on well-known systems-engineering (SE) methods and a structural analysis based on classic analytic and numerical approaches of thin-wall aeronautical structures. The methodological approach draws upon the Quality Functions Deployment (QFD) and the Functional Analysis (FA). Both methods allow to understand better the redesign problem and to propose a solution that ensures the satisfaction of the customer needs (i.e., launcher, structural designers, mission). The fabrication of the C-Ep laminate is accomplished with the wet lay-up process plus hot bonding with flexible heater blankets and a vacuum bag. The choice of C-Ep as the main construction material implied a reduction of 40% of mass, and a simultaneous increase of almost 12 times the bending stiffness, 4 times the buckling strength and 10 times the buckling load with respect to the all-metal VLW. Launch cost reduction could be substantial depending on the initial cost. To conclude, the hypothesis that conjectures a reduction of costs and the enhancement of the performance of the structure is proved positive on account of the simultaneous increase of the specific stiffness of the material and of the load bearing capacity of the C-Ep VLW. QFD and FA prove to be effective methods to understand and solve the redesign problem beyond the standard methods focused exclusively on analysis}

abstract = {Injection mold development lead time has been reduced presently by over 50% by employing rapid prototyping based tooling methods. Rapid tooling methods however, have certain limitations in terms of mold material, accuracy, surface finish, and mold life. The relevant process knowledge, especially for newer routes, is not very well established, resulting inconsistent or inappropriate rapid tooling (RT) process selection and mold design incompatibility. This paper presents a computer aided rapid tooling process selection and manufacturability evaluation methodology for injection molding, supported by mold cost estimation models and RT process capability database. Rapid tooling process selection is based on process capability mapping in quality function deployment (QFD) against a set of tooling requirements that are prioritized through pairwise comparison using analytical hierarchal process (AHP). The mold manufacturability for the selected RT process is carried out using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) to identify problem features, if any. This is followed by estimating the cost of RT mold and comparing it with a conventional mold, using cost models developed based on the concept of cost drivers and cost modifiers. The entire methodology has been implemented in a software program using Visual C++ in Windows environment and demonstrated on an experimental mold as well as industrial cases. The proposed methodology enables selecting an appropriate rapid tooling process for a given injection mold requirement, and identifying critical features that could be modified to improve manufacturability, thereby achieving better quality and lower cost of molded parts along with shorter lead time.}

The five tools that commonly combined with the AHP include mathematical programming, quality function deployment (QFD), meta-heuristics, SWOT analysis, and data envelopment analysis (DEA). This paper reviews the literature of the applications of the integrated AHPs. Related articles appearing in the international journals from 1997 to 2006 are gathered and analyzed so that the following three questions can be answered: (i) which type of the integrated AHPs was paid most attention to? (ii) which area the integrated AHPs were prevalently applied to? (iii) is there any inadequacy of the approaches? Based on the inadequacy, if any, some improvements and possible future work are recommended. This research not only provides evidence that the integrated AHPs are better than the stand-alone AHP, but also aids the researchers and decision makers in applying the integrated AHPs effectively.}

By using a model to identify the life-cycle stage of the product technology, each electronic product technology is classified in order to determine how to obtain the technology. A multi-objective evaluation model of planning strategies is obtained for electronic product technology development to evaluate the performance of different planning strategies.

Despite TRIZ official development ended in 1985, researchers have continued its development by proposing new approaches (e.g. OTSM, TRIZ+, SPARK) or by extending existing ones. After all these efforts, the spread of TRIZ has never reached the level of capillarity expected. For this reason, in the last years, TRIZ community has interrogated more than once about the motivations for this slow growth. In order to accelerate the spread of TRIZ, many attempts were made to simplify the method, sometimes by integrating it with other methods (such as FMEA, QFD, Lean) that were already present in production plants and increasing TRIZ notoriety by publishing successful case studies. This work is an updated picture of the current situation of TRIZ case studies publications. More than 200 case studies from TRIZ journal and ETRIA TRIZ Future Conference have been collected, analysed and processed to understand Why companies needs TRIZ, which tools are the most used, how TRIZ has been integrated with other methods, and how industries and academies communicate their success. Differently to other surveys, this study also focuses on the ways in which solutions are presented, so as to identify best practices or new ideas and trends from a communication perspective. This paper contains the results of this analysis and the related comments.}

abstract = {Choosing the most suitable superstructure is vital for the success of a small to medium-span highway bridge design. Numerous attributes must be considered and evaluated in terms of many different conflicting criteria in the conceptual design of a bridge, leading to a large set of subjective or ambiguous data. Furthermore, integrating experts’ knowledge and experiences to make appropriate decisions is a commonly used method. In order to solve this problem, project managers and design engineers need to evaluate their initiative designs carefully and make accurate decisions. For this reason, a systematic decision process for selecting the best design idea by means of a novel integrated optimization-based methodology is proposed. In the first phase, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is employed for translating the project requirements into design requirements. In the second phase, Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is utilized to select the best superstructure as an alternative, based on the weighted criteria achieved from the first phase. In this study the rating values regarding to each alternative and criteria throughout the phases are described in a fuzzy environment by means of linguistic variables. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the implementation process of the integrated methodology for bridge superstructure design. For this purpose, an expert team has been formed to collect and verify the expectations of the project, which located in Tehran, Iran. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology could be successfully applied in the highway bridge projects as a useful tool to facilitate decision making.}

We develop and solve optimization models for the identification of consensus rankings and ratings, that take into account the priorities and perceptions of all the customers in a target market. Then, based on the consensus rankings, we identify a parts mix for the new/improved product that satisfies a budget constraint and matches or exceeds the performance expectations of all customers surveyed in the target market. Finally, we show how the QFD charts can be used to identify competitors that are falsely perceived as superior, as well as areas where the firm's marketing strategies have had the desired effects.

abstract = {Agile practices are increasingly introduced in R&D departments of manufacturing companies, with the aim of simultaneously improve the development speed and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions. At the same time, growing product complexity is addressed through an increasing number of collaborations in so-called product development networks. However, there is no systematic approach in scientific literature that combines these two trends and relates the organizational characteristics of agile product development with the design of a product development network. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for the design of product development networks in order to increase organizational agility. The construct of agility is characterized by a set of agile attributes (AA), while the network design is described by network features (NF). To connect these dimensions, a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) model with two related Houses of Quality (HOQ) is developed. The first HOQ determines the importance of each AA based on the strategy-specific competitive bases (CB) of the company applying the methodology. The second HOQ relates the weighted AA with the NF. Thus, transparency about relations between attributes of organizational agility and network design features is generated. The methodology supports a company in the following two dimensions. First, it provides information about which NF represent the most auspicious levers for optimization measures to allow an efficient prioritization in network management. Second, it indicates the direction of optimization for each NF depending on the actual status of the network.}

Companies need to form research and development (R&D) strategies to improve key functional features for short lifespan products to reflect the adoption of innovative technologies and changing customer expectations. With the pervasive use of the Internet, this research crawls and analyzes the online voice of customers (VoC), overcoming the time lag of offline surveys, to identify and prioritize product functions for deployment using extended quality function deployment (eQFD) models. In this research, the novel analytics of the manufacturer’s patent portfolio is added as an additional eQFD dimension to map ranked functional improvements to a manufacturer’s R&D capabilities. Thus, a computer supported eQFD system is developed to perform the unique mappings and gap analyses between the VoC, the prioritized product functions, and the manufacturer’s patent portfolio. The newly developed eQFD methodology and its novel discoveries are demonstrated in detail using a case study of three smart phones launched during the same time frame. The products include the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Huawei Honor 5X, and the ASUS Zenfone 3. The newly developed methodology is generally applicable to support VoC-centric product function deployment and R&D strategic planning in other domains.}

On the other side, while the health care market is continuously raising, the manufacturing industry, specially the automotive one, is facing a strongly negative trend under production and sales point of view. In this panorama, the development of biomedical devices represents a big chance for both patient's th care and manufacturing industry being an interesting opportunity for investments. In order to design a new product, it is necessary to take into account the market needs and requests, especially when it is high-tech and involves human needs. Unfortunately, it often happens that the languages and research approaches of the parts involved in the market, supply and demand, are different which makes the communication more difficult, especially when Medicine and Engineering are involved. For example, requirements such as biocompatibility, life service or biological integration have to be translated in terms of material, manufacturing process or treatment. In order to correlate performance characteristics and design choice, tools like QFD (Quality Function Deployment) are available. In particular, they use results of market investigations on existing products and market requests to identify the improvement areas, to correlate them with design specifications so outlining the features of new products able to satisfy the market requests. Within this approach, the present paper shows the results of a market analysis focused on hip prosthesis improvement. Therefore, using questionnaires sent to specialized physicians and medical centers, it was possible to collect information about pro and cons of existing devices identifying their criticalness’ with particular attention to stem osteointegration. In fact, compiling a QFD table, it was possible to design new concepts of the prosthesis stem which are here described and their mechanical resistance was tested using FEM simulations.}

Moreover, in the last years, high power machines, advanced technologies, higher cost for spare parts and repairing, and fuel consumption contributed to an even more higher increase of the machinery costs. Many engineering and economic methodological approaches have been implemented to calculate machinery use and cost, but they are almost confined in scientific and technical documentations making it difficult for a farmer to apply these approaches for deciding on buying, leasing, or sharing agricultural machinery. Information and communications technology (ICT) has an increasingly important role on business processes and provides a powerful foundation to address many daily problems. Today users want to be connected to useful information in real time. To that effect, the aim of this work was to develop an easy-to-use mobile application, called “AMACA” (Agricultural Machine App Cost Analysis) for determining the machinery cost in different field operations and making it available via a web mobile application using a cross-platform approach. The customer-driven Quality Function Deployment [QFD] approach was implemented in order to link the user expectations with the design characteristics of the app. The AMACA app is free, readily available, and does not require any installation on the end user’s device. It is a cross-platform application meaning that it operates on any device through a web interface and is supported by various browsers. The user can make subsequent calculations by varying the input parameters (fuel price, interest rate, field capacity, tractor power, etc.) and compare the results in a sensitivity analysis basis. AMACA app can support the decisions on whether to purchase a new equipment/tractor (strategic level), the use of own machinery or to hire a service, and also to select the economical appropriate cultivation system (tactical level).}

QFD uses a matrix called the house of quality (HoQ) to translate customer requirements (CRs) into engineering characteristics (ECs). Constructing the HoQ, which includes determining the importance weights of CRs, the correlation matrix among ECs and the relationship matrix between CRs and ECs, is an important issue in the application of QFD. However, decision-makers (DMs) participating the construction of HoQ tend to give their individual judgments in multi-format or multi-granularity depending on their different knowledge, experience, culture and circumstance. Furthermore, these judgments are more difficult to assess with the precise quantitative forms due to the vagueness and uncertainty existed in the early stage of new product development. In this paper, a group decision-making approach incorporating with two optimization models (i.e. logarithmic least squares model and weighted least squares model) is proposed to aggregate these multi-format and multi-granularity linguistic judgments. Fuzzy set theory is utilized to address the uncertainty in the decision-making process. The proposed method is illustrated with a real-world case of horizontal directional drilling machine. The application indicates that the group decision-making method may be a promising tool for constructing the HoQ.}

In order to define the priorities of all stakeholders' requirements, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) Extent Analysis approach is used. The method is applied for the product “hand blender”, a member of Electrical and Electronic Equipment family, which attracts a significant interest because of its negative impacts on the environment and human health.

A quality function deployment-based framework under fuzzy environment is proposed to effectively regulate the risks and manage the safety of HazMats transportation process. The framework includes three components. A 4D identification system, namely, “H (human) – M (material) – E (environment) – M (management),” for risk factors is constructed in the first stage, and the basic importance rating of each factor is calculated in the second stage. Subsequently, the corresponding risk control measures are proposed, and the correlation between risk factors and control measures are identified. Finally, the improved priority of each risk control measure, which is the benchmark for limited enterprise resource allocation and risk management policy development, is calculated in the third stage. In particular, this study utilizes fuzzy linguistic terms that are then transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers as evaluation tool for facilitating the expression of experts and decreasing information loss by considering the uncertainty and ambiguity of risk evaluation process. In addition, a new comprehensive weighting model is constructed to determine the influence of experts under group decision-making environment. The proposed framework is applied to explain the process of the risk management and loss prevention of a HazMats transportation company in China. Results not only provide certain acceptable recommendations to safety management of HazMat transportation process but also verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.}

Such a fragmented operational design poses several problems magnified by the presence of necessary public health measures fueled by COVID-19. This work contributes to the domain literature by introducing an overarching framework for synthesizing strategies in public sector SCs. The underlying component is the translation of information from the upstream to the downstream entities of the SCs, which is carried out by a Kano-enhanced quality function deployment. The proposed framework introduces intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) decision maps with the aid of the full consistency method to incorporate inherent interrelationships among strategies in the translation agenda. Under an IF environment that better captures judgment uncertainties, an actual case study of a multi-level public sector SC motivated by a government-funded project under the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrated in this work. Findings of the case suggest that the government prioritizes meeting all project objectives. This requirement is reflected in the downstream SC. The project planning entity focuses on creating an overarching plan of operations, material request entity on complying with government procurement protocols, and maintaining public health and safety in operations for the procurement entity. Results show the effective synthesis of strategies across the SC, ensuring SC integration and collaboration. The case study demonstrates that maintaining public health and safety is a significant component of post-COVID-19 public sector SCs. Several practical insights on the synthesis of public sector SC strategies are also provided in this work.}

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design framework with the aim of improving public engagement at an early design stage. Following a modified quality function deployment (QFD) process, it enables incorporation of public preferences into the design process, thus helping to improve the social acceptability of large infrastructure projects and reduce costs related to opposition and delays. The application of the framework is illustrated by a case study related to design of nuclear power plants.}

abstract = {A new approach for customer oriented business process modelling is presented in the paper in a procedural format. The practical application of the approach to a real world case at Neste Advanced Power Systems Finland is described. Although customer orientation is central in current discussions about business strategies, the current functional modelling methods of business processes do not fully support the customer viewpoint. The approach combines formally the internal analysis of the business processes and the external analysis of the customer expectations about their performance. The formalism used is based on a new statistically extended version of QFD (Quality Function Deployment) and on the statistical analysis of the business process variables starting from an IDEF0 description of the business processes. The statistically extended QFD brings traditional QFD more close to customer needs associated to operational business process design. The approach also guides in planning the simulation experiments with dynamic simulation software packages so that the customer's voice is taken into account when selecting the parameters to vary in the behavioural simulation.}

This paper is devoted to conceptual design evaluation for product environmental footprint using unascertained measure model. After the unascertained measure model based on the Unascertained Mathematical Theory is introduced, the evaluation process of solutions in conceptual design for product environmental footprint based on unascertained measure model is discussed in detail. And the product conceptual design for product environmental footprint integrated with unascertained measure model-based evaluation approach is also proposed. The conceptual design of the offshore wind power installation platform is given as an example, which demonstrates that the methodology is helpful to design evaluation in conceptual design for product environmental footprint.}

The external components of the model are customers and their wants, competitors, and the characteristics of various locations. The internal components of the model are the critical processes in the manufacturing organization. The framework presented uses quality function deployment (QFD), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP). QFD matrices with interconnected rows and columns relate market segments, competitive priorities, critical processes, location attributes and various locations. AHP determines the intensity of the relationship between the row and column variables of each matrix. Finally, ANP determines the intensity of synergistic effects among column variables. The model fine-tunes and adds precision to an otherwise qualitative strategic decision process. The applicability of our proposed model is demonstrated with a case study that summarizes an intervention in which the model's framework and basic concepts were applied.}

Based on a prioritization method suggested by Wasserman [1], this paper integrates design costs into the QFD framework. This proposed approach enables designers to optimize product development resources towards customer satisfaction and conduct analytical investigations to facilitate decision making in product design and development.}

After a comprehensive description of the relevant elements in house of quality (HOQ), the first and most influential phase of the QFD system, a 9-step model is proposed to help build such an HOQ. A number of 9-point scales are developed whose uses could help unify the various measurements in HOQ to avoid arbitrariness. Special attention is paid to the various subjective assessments in the HOQ process, and symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers (STFNs) are suggested for use to capture the vagueness in people's linguistic assessments. Instead of using the quite subjective sales-point concept, entropy method is introduced to conduct competitive analysis and derive competitive priority ratings. A thorough explanation is given to address the concepts, computations and implementations in the proposed HOQ model, followed by a full example for a fried Chinese vegetable to illustrate step by step all the relevant details with the purpose of facilitating the understanding and application of the QFD process. Two difficult parts omitted from our model, especially the correlation matrices, are discussed in some detail finally, and possible approaches are also suggested to deal with them in a potentially more complete HOQ model.}

Plant operator’s requirements are correlated with design attributes. Radar diagrams visualize requirements attainments and indicate individual strengths and weaknesses of the design. In addition the Degree of Attraction is introduced and specified as a characteristic, comparable performance parameter among innovative plant designs. In order to identify and classify plant operator’s requirements a survey in the means of Kano’s theory has been conducted. Classified requirements are weighted in order to set up the characterization model. Transformable plant designs are applied in this work as they currently represent a highly discussed example of innovative plants in process industry. As there are several transformable designs in research and practice aiming for different purposes a morphology has been developed in order to be able to define each individual design. Using the morphology for defining design attributes in the model allows a characterization of transformable plants. It is shown that transformable designs lead to highly attractive plants.}

However, there is somewhat lacking in systemic analytical methods for product design time (PDT). For this end, this paper explores an intelligent method to evaluate the PDT. At the early development stage, designers are short of sufficient product information and have difficulty in determining PDT by subjective evaluation. Thus, a fuzzy measurable house of quality (FM-HOQ) model is proposed to provide measurable engineering information. Quality function deployment (QFD) is combined with a mapping pattern of “function→principle→structure” to extract product characteristics from customer demands. Then, a fuzzy support vector regression machine (FSVRM) model is built to fuse data and realize the estimation of PDT, which makes use of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to simplify structure. In a word, the whole estimation method consists of four steps: time factors identification, product characteristics extraction by QFD and function mapping pattern, FSVRM learning, and PDT estimation. Finally, to illustrate the procedure of the estimation method, the case of injection mold design is studied. The results of experiments show that the fuzzy method is feasible and effective.}

abstract = {Due to market dynamics and challenges, it is imperative for companies to put their concern on strategic marketing orientation. In fact, products and services of similar quality are ubiquitous in today's global market. Basically, functionality and usability alone are no longer prominent success factors in product and service innovation because customers today concern themselves more on satisfying their emotions than merely their cognition. Kansei Engineering (KE) has shown its superiority in investigating and modelling customer emotion (“Kansei” in Japanese) for product development. In dealing with customer needs, service quality tools such as quality function deployment (QFD) and the Kano model, have been applied extensively. But none have been able to incorporate and model customers’emotional needs. Some attention has been given to investigate this but, thus far, there is no formal methodology that can account for customer emotional needs in service design. To fill this niche, this study proposed an integrative framework of KE incorporating the Kano model and QFD applied to services. This study extended the work by Hartono and Tan (2011) and Hartono et al. (2012) and presented a survey on luxury hotel services involving more than a hundred Indonesian tourists as the subject of study. Luxury hotels are reported to have greater strength of emotion than any other hotel segment. This work confirmed that emotion is to be more important than cognition in impacting overall customer satisfaction. Practically, it gives insight on which service attributes deserve more attention with regard to their impact on customer emotion. Indonesian tourists shared a common response to the Kansei word “elegant” which correlates with their common cultural dimension of “power distance”. Performing a Kansei evaluation to understanding cultural backgrounds may yield valuable insights for international tourist marketing strategies and companies’ business sustainability.}

To manage reasonably the environmental, economic and social goals in actual product design, this paper proposes a quality characteristic extraction method for complex products with multi-granular fuzzy language based on the triple bottom lines of sustainability. Satisfaction evaluation of a customer group expressed in multi-granular fuzzy language is given full consideration with the adoption of dominant granular structures. Interval rough number (IRN) is employed for product quality function development (QFD) to fully retain the calculation simplicity of rough sets and expression flexibility of interval numbers in the correlation transformation between customer requirements and quality characteristics. A multi-objective optimization model for the quality characteristic extraction of complex products is established according to the triple bottom lines of sustainability, and an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm with the segmented variable step size is designed to solve it efficiently. Lastly, the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by the case study of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool.}

More specifically, the question of how to modularize services in the practical context is still an unexplored subject. In response, this paper proposes a solid framework for service modularization, by employing and modifying the House of Quality (HoQ) structure in Quality Function Deployment (QFD) using two ways: driver-based approach and interrelationship-based approach. Firstly, module drivers representing the service characteristics are identified through a comprehensive literature review. In this step, twofold module drivers are identified: one for common and the other for service-specific. Secondly, by considering the interdependent nature of service offering, service is decomposed according to the three predefined dimensions: service process, service outcome, and prerequisites for the service. Service modularization is then conducted using HoQ structure; the relationships between module drivers and decomposed service components are analyzed in the Strategic Modularability Matrix (SMM), whereas the interrelationships among service components are identified in Interrelated Components Modularability Matrix (ICMM). Finally, a clustering analysis is conducted to identify the module candidates. In order to illustrate the utility of the proposed approach, a restaurant service is exemplified. This study contributes to the field by filling the void left by the service sector by applying the service-specific module drivers to modularize services, as well as analyzing the relationship among service components using three interrelated dimensions.}

The method is based on the assumption that consumers' and panellists' perceptions are non-identical, statistically significant relationships; ANOVA and experimental design are used as intermediate methods. The results are analysed at two levels: the measurement level (the tertiary operational level in a traditional QFD approach, univariate analyses) and the latent level (the secondary tactic QFD level, multivariate analyses). The products are evaluated by consumers and trained panellists. The consumers evaluated a subset of the products on 11 attributes by using a 9-point ideal scale, and rated the importance of the attributes as well. The results are combined in two matrices, A (significant consumer relationships) and B (significant panellist relationships). By multiplying the matrices the consumers' perceptions are translated into panellists' perceptions. Furthermore, the priority of the sensory attributes are calculated as a weighted sum with the self-reported importance. Finally, a screening model is developed. For product development of food, the method implicates that the consumer needs regarding good sensory quality are translated into a subset of sensory attributes measurable by conventional descriptive analysis, consumer acceptance is related to the design factors. The evaluation of the sensory quality of future pea varieties can be based on a systematic screening model developed in accordance with consumer needs.}

abstract = {In its hyper-inflated usage, innovation simply means “something new”, and is applied to any technical novelty. In its true meaning, innovating means designing something that will not only work under a technical point of view, but will also make business sense. “Design for Innovation” means considering that design cannot simply focus on a narrow meaning of “product use”, because this could severely limit the diffusion of innovative products. The paper proposes an original model for representing what we call “beyond-use situations” and the influences among the actors involved in the innovation diffusion process. Taking inspiration from social influence network models and from the Multi-issue Actor Strategy Analysis Model (MASAM), the paper presents an operational methodology to assess the influence of different actors on the decision to adopt a new product. In turn, such methodology should support design teams to conceive novel solutions more likely to become factual innovations. The paper also describes a computer-implementable technique, loosely derived from Quality Function Deployment, to practically apply the proposed methodology. An industrial case study from the medical-care sector illustrates its logic and operational steps.}

abstract = {Product planning is one of four important processes in new product development (NPD) using quality function deployment (QFD), which is a widely used customer-driven approach. In our opinion, the first problem to be solved is how to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative information regarding relationships between customer requirements (CRs) and engineering characteristics (ECs) as well as those among ECs into the problem formulation. Owing to the typical vagueness or imprecision of functional relationships in a product, product planning is becoming more difficult, particularly in a fuzzy environment. In this paper, an asymmetric fuzzy linear regression approach is proposed to estimate the functional relationships for product planning based on QFD. Firstly, by integrating the least-squares regression into fuzzy linear regression, a pair of hybrid linear programming models with asymmetric triangular fuzzy coefficients are developed to estimate the functional relationships for product planning under uncertainties. Secondly, using the basic concept of fuzzy regression, asymmetric triangular fuzzy coefficients are extended to asymmetric trapezoidal fuzzy coefficients, and another pair of hybrid linear programming models with asymmetric trapezoidal fuzzy coefficients is proposed. The main advantage of these hybrid-programming models is to integrate both the property of central tendency in least squares and the possibilistic property in fuzzy regression. Next, the illustrated example shows that trapezoidal fuzzy number coefficients have more flexibility to handle a wider variety of systematic uncertainties and ambiguities that cannot be modeled efficiently using triangular number fuzzy coefficients. Both asymmetric triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy number coefficients can be applicable to a much wider variety of design problems where uncertain, qualitative, and fuzzy relationships are involved than when symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers are used. Finally, future research direction is also discussed.}

Next, the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) technique is adopted to construct a clear model of a hierarchical structure. Finally, the Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) approach is employed to analyze the effect and dependence among the overall design components, and to consider the relationship network graph of distribution of components in the system. The research approach applies the Web mail system as its case study. Through the empirical study of web-based system, interface designers can effectively grasp a user's differentiated demand that changes rapidly and reflect it in the combination of designed components.

abstract = {Product and service quality can only be effectively improved when the most important needs of customers are satisfied. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is an approach used to guide R&D, manufacturing, and management toward the development of products and services that satisfy the needs of consumers. The QFD operations are performed by way of a diagram called the House of Quality (HOQ). The HOQ contains information about the customers' needs (what), mechanisms to address these needs (how), and the criterion for deciding which “what” is the most important and which “how” provides the greatest customer satisfaction. A less familiar application of QFD is for the improvement of retail services. When QFD is applied to retail services, a computerized HOQ approach becomes integral to the process for providing continuous, iterative quality improvement. The objective of this research is to develop a formal QFD methodology for the retail industry and to build a computerized retail QFD system. The system provides a HOQ architecture for specifying and analyzing the customers' needs, deriving improvement strategies, and formalizing records of progress. Furthermore, two ranking methods that apply customer satisfaction theory are used to assist managers improve retail services. This system provides an integrated workbench for building retail HOQs and designing retail service strategies.}

abstract = {Compressed image quality enhancement has attracted a large amount of attention in recent years. In general, the primary goal of compression is artifact reduction to produce a higher-quality output from a low-quality input. Information loss and compression artifacts are mostly due to quantization. The quantization matrix is determined by the compression quality factor (QF). However, there has thus far been little related research to estimate the compression quality factor for JPEG images. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep dual-domain semi-blind network (D3SN) that combines compression quality factor detection and compressed image quality enhancement. Specifically, a quality factor detection (QFD) module is designed to capture contextual information of the space and frequency domains. Furthermore, we build a novel deep dual-domain compressed image quality enhancement network to remove the compression artifacts by using the prior in terms of both the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and pixel domains. Different from previous algorithms, our proposed approach can remove compression artifacts generated at different quality factors by inferring the image quality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our deep dual-domain semi-blind network over state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective quality and visual results.}

abstract = {Purpose
The paper proposes a decision support system for selecting logistics providers based on the quality function deployment (QFD) and the technique for order preference by the similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for agricultural supply chain in France. The research provides a platform for group decision making to facilitate decision process and check the consistency of the outcomes.
Methodology
The proposed model looks at the decision problem from two points of view considering both technical and customer perspectives. The main customer criteria are confidence in a safe and durable product, emission of pollutants and hazardous materials, social responsibility, etc. The main technical factors are financial stability, quality, delivery condition, services, etc. based on the literature review. The second stage in the adopted methodology is the combination of quality function deployment and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to effectively analyze the decision problem. In final section we structure a group decision system called GRoUp System (GRUS) which has been developed by Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) in the Toulouse University.
Results
This paper designs a group decision making system to interface decision makers and customer values in order to aid agricultural partners and investors in the selection of third party logistic providers. Moreover, we have figured out a decision support system under fuzzy linguistic variables is able to assist agricultural parties in uncertain situations. This integrated and efficient decision support system enhances quality and reliability of the decision making.
Novelty/Originality
The novelty of this paper is reflected by several items. The integration of group multi-criteria decision tools enables decision makers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of customer needs and technical requirements of the logistic process. In addition, this investigation is carried out under a European commission project called Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) which models risk reduction and elimination from the agricultural supply chain. Ultimately, we have implemented the decision support tool to select the best logistic provider among France logistics and transportation companies.}

This requires a different mindset. This paper discusses four tools that fit in the engineers’ toolkit to approach these multidisciplinary problems: TRIZ, Systematic Inventive Thinking, Quality Function Deployment and FunKey Architecting. The tools are discussed and rated on four scales: difficulty of problems, complexity of problems, design phase and learning effort. From the characterization a set of heuristics is derived that help in choosing the appropriate tool from the toolkit. It is concluded that the four tools largely complement each other and should therefore be part of every engineer's toolkit.}

Criteria are specified by technical and customer requirements gathered from Gujarat, India. The concepts are compared to a standard LFR for reference, and as a result, a novel ‘Elevation Linear Fresnel Reflector’ (ELFR) concept using elevating mirrors is selected. A detailed version of this concept is proposed and compared against two standard LFR configurations, one using constant and the other using variable horizontal mirror spacing. Annual performance is analysed for a typical meteorological year. Financial assessment is made through the construction of a prototype. The novel LFR has an annual optical efficiency of 49% and increases exergy by 13–23%. Operational hours above a target temperature of 300 °C are increased by 9–24%. A 17% reduction in land usage is also achievable. However, the ELFR suffers from additional complexity and a 16–28% increase in capital cost. It is concluded that this novel design is particularly promising for industrial applications and locations with restricted land availability or high land costs. The decision analysis methodology adopted is considered to have a wider potential for applications in the fields of renewable energy and sustainable design.}

So far few approaches for CISs resilience improvement have recognized that different resilience improvement efforts could have synergetic or conflicting correlations between them. There lack systemic approaches for transforming resilience improvement requirements into coordinated and implementable measures. To address this gap, the current study proposes a quality function deployment (QFD)-based framework for strengthening the resilience of CISs. The proposed framework involves different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and takes into consideration the correlations between resilience improvement efforts at these stages. It can transform resilience criteria into system properties, component characteristics, implementation processes and controlling factors successively, which is facilitated with a series of houses of quality (HoQs). Using a case study of electric power system, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed framework with detailed explanations of the design and implementation of the first HoQ. The results of the case study showed that the proposed framework could identify the trade-offs between resilience improvement efforts at different stages of the CISs lifecycle, and take into account their relationships with resilience criteria and the correlations among them to work out optimized solutions for improved CISs resilience.}

A collection of 12 assessment criteria classified into two categories have been considered. Eight factors are derived from customer suggestions and the other four are design specifications required to manufacture the product. The main outcomes are: a hybrid autonomous model to evaluate supplier bids without direct human intervention; devising a hybrid three-module method and overcoming complexity of computations in resulting algorithm by means of agents; outlining the best criteria to assess suppliers; evaluating the suppliers based on voice of customer during all stages of the process; and discussing analysis, design, and implementation issues of the evaluation agent. The paper includes implications for development of an integrated total system for supply chain coordination. The most important advantages of this work over earlier researches on supplier selection are: implementation of an autonomous assessment mechanism using intelligent agents for the first time, making the best out of three widely applied methodologies all at once, evaluation process mainly based on features of customer order, coordination of supply job based on a bidding system, and portal-mediated operation and control.}

Background
Health care has a number of historical barriers to capturing the voice of the customer and to incorporating customer wants into health care services, whether the customer is a patient, an insurer, or a community. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a set of tools and practices that can help overcome these barriers to form a process for the planning and design or redesign of products and services. The goal of the project was to increase referral volume and to improve a rehabilitation hospital’s capacity to provide comprehensive medical and/or legal evaluations for people with complex and catastrophic injuries or illnesses.
High-level view of QFD as a process
The steps in QFD are as follows: capture of the voice of the customer, quality deployment, functions deployment, failure mode deployment, new process deployment, and task deployment. The output of each step becomes the input to a matrix tool or table of the next step of the process.
Case study example
In 3½ months a nineperson project team at Continental Rehabilitation Hospital (San Diego) used QFD tools to capture the voice of the customer, use these data as the basis for a questionnaire on important qualities of service from the customer’s perspective, obtain competitive data on how the organization was perceived to be meeting the demanded qualities, identify measurable dimensions and targets of these qualities, and incorporate the functions and tasks into the delivery of service which are necessary to meet the demanded qualities.
Discussion
The future of providing health care services will belong to organizations that can adapt to a rapidly changing environment and to demands for new products and services that are produced and delivered in new ways.}
