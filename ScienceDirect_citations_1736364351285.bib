abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to balance social, environmental and economic criteria, alongside related ethical issues, in the supplier selection process when outsourcing activities in the textile industry. We propose a multi-criteria model to support supplier selection process, whereby suppliers are allocated to classes based on sustainability, integrating the opinions of customers and managers. The model has three phases: i) criteria definition, in which the Copeland method is used to aggregate criteria reported in the literature for a group of decision makers (customers and expert managers); ii) elicitation of the perceptions of decision-makers, about criteria and the definition of weights for these criteria using the AHP method, and iii) multi-criteria classification of suppliers performed using the ELECTRE-TRI method. A numerical application was performed in the textile sector in order to test results. The main results show that suppliers can be classified, balancing social, environmental and economic criteria and related ethical issues, considering opinions from customers and experts. The theoretical implications can benefit researchers who can apply the model in future research into economic, environmental and social interactions. Managers can use the structure presented in this model to improve supplier selection.}

abstract = {New product development (NPD) is a crucial process to keep a company being competitive. However, because of its inherent features, NPD is a process with high risk as well as high uncertainty. To ensure a smooth operation of NPD, the risk involved in the process need to be assessed and the uncertainty should also be addressed properly. Facing these two tasks, in this paper, the critical risk factors in NPD are first analyzed. Since Bayesian network is specialized in dealing with uncertainties, those risk factors are then modeled into a Bayesian network to facilitate the assessing of the risk involved in an NPD process. To generate the probabilities of different kinds of nodes in a Bayesian network, a systematic probability generation approach is proposed with emphasis on generating the conditional probabilities of the nodes with multi-parents. A case study is also given in the paper to test and validate the critical risk factors as well as the probability generation approach.}

Modern efficiency evaluation approaches mostly deal with quantitative factors and evaluations are made in the context of other parts of management, e.g., planning, controlling, and budgeting. But sometimes it is necessary to evaluate an organizational structure autonomously, when it is available only the limited information about structure: the numbers of hierarchical levels and the subjects on each level. This paper focuses on autonomous approach. It is based on the questions-criteria hierarchy constructed using fundamental laws. Some experimental results are presented.}

Warehouse location is a long-term decision and is influenced by many quantitative and qualitative factors. Among the main criteria taken into account in this paper, some are costs, labor characteristics, infrastructure, and markets. This paper also includes some sub-criteria because of the hierarchical structure of the problem, like tax incentives and tax structures, availability of labor force, quality and reliability of modes of transportation, and proximity to customers. The conventional approaches to warehouse location selection problem tend to be less effective in dealing with the imprecise or vague nature of the linguistic assessment. Under many situations, the values of the qualitative criteria are often imprecisely defined for the decision-makers. Choquet integral is a suitable multi-criteria method to capture this imprecise or vague nature. This paper shows a successful application of multi-criteria Choquet integral to a real warehouse location selection problem of a big Turkish logistic firm.}

The article emphasises the importance of process modelling as a tool that allows the capturing, externalisation, formalisation and structuring of knowledge about enterprise processes. Furthermore, business process modelling is demonstrated to be a powerful tool and approach to knowledge management. We also explain how reference models of business processes can be helpful in project- or process design, process re-engineering, management and execution. Finally, we present findings acquired in the re-engineering of the process of new product development that included an AS-IS model for analysis and the definition of a TO-BE model.}

In order to systematically exploit these potentials the interrelations between physical products and non-physical services need to be considered proactively, resulting in the necessity for integrating corresponding product and service design processes. For this reason, a process for the systematic design of product related technical services is introduced that upon its modularization represents a promising starting point for linkage with corresponding product design processes. Life cycle oriented design of technical Product-Service Systems is thus supported. The presented concept is finally illustrated by means of an example from the investment goods industry.}

It proposes a technology-driven roadmapping processes that starts from capability analysis for technology planning and ends with business opportunity analysis for market planning. We suggest the use of patent data as a proxy measure of technological capability for this purpose and develop four analysis modules — Monitoring, Collaboration, Diversification, and Benchmarking — to support decision-making during the process. Various analysis techniques such as text-mining, network analysis, citation analysis and index analysis are applied to discover meaningful implications from the patent data, which are summarized in four maps — Actor-similarity map, Actor-relations map, Technology-industry map, and Technology-affinity map. For the purpose of illustration, RFID-related patents are collected and the 18 firms with the most patents used, focusing especially on the third biggest. We believe using roadmapping and patent analysis together can play complementary roles for each other. Putting roadmapping techniques together with patent analysis can increase the objectivity and reliability of technology roadmap, while using patent analysis restricted to technological information together with roadmapping techniques can ensure that a more valuable breadth of strategic information is extracted from patents.}

In many cases stakeholders who have different perspectives and expectations about the future system need to collaborate to clarify, capture and uncover user requirements in an efficient and effective manner. Many industry experts have admitted that collaboration among stakeholders in a facilitated workshop, aimed at defining and articulating user requirements, is one of the most difficult tasks in software development. The aim of the research described in this paper is to present a process that can address the challenges of collaborative user requirements elicitation workshops. The process contains activities that correspond to a pattern of collaboration. Developed on a pattern-based architecture, the process is reusable and can be applied to similar user requirements elicitation workshops. To achieve this goal, the principles of Collaboration Engineering (CE) are applied to design collaborative processes that consist of ThinkLets, a set of facilitation scripts and process-building blocks, bundled together. The process is evaluated in practice by running facilitated workshops as well as by collecting experts’ comments and opinions. The results indicate that the approach is usable and useful. The paper concludes with further elaboration and discussions on research contribution and potential future work in the field.}

Performance measurement in R&D is particularly difficult because (1) effort levels may not be observable, (2) project success is uncertain, influenced by uncontrollable factors, and (3) success can be assessed only after long delays, or it accrues to other units of the organization. Based on existing literature on the problem, we developed a performance measurement system for the process technology research group of an industrial company. This measurement system systematically supported the business strategy. Moreover, the measures were adjusted for different project profiles: short- versus long term, hardware versus software, routine support services versus breakthrough ideas and knowledge development. The contribution of this article is a description of the process of developing and implementing a comprehensive performance measurement system in a company, based on previous performance management research, and supporting the company’s strategy. It is noteworthy that the system was implemented in a research group (as opposed to development), where the measurement problems are the most severe.}

Fatty acid content of the tissue was increased to 12.4 nmol/mg wet weight by treating the tissue with 380 μM isoproterenol at pH 7.4 for 15 min in the absence of glucose and albumin. Myelin figures were found in freeze-fracture replicas of isproterenol-treated tissue fixed with glutaraldehyde at pH 7.4 and then incubated and glycerinated at pH 8.1. Myelin figures were seen in replicas as concave or convex laminated sheets and long cylindrical multilamellar structures in fat cells and extracellular space. Myelin figures were sometimes seen in cells extending from the surface of intracellular lipid droplets, the site of lipolysis, to the cell surface and extracellular space. Myelin figures were not found in isoproterenol-treated tissue fixed at pH 7.4 and processed at pH 7.0. Smooth-surfaced droplets, instead, were found in these tissues in the extracellular space. Neither myelin figures nor smooth-surfaced droplets were found in tissues treated with insulin and glucose (to reduce fatty acid content to 1.4 nmol/mg), fixed at pH 7.4 and processed at either pH 8.1 or pH 7.0. Lowering pH of the media to 4.5 during processing of tissues treated with isoproterenol at pH 9.0 caused disappearance of myelin figures and appearance of smooth-surfaced droplets in the extracellular space. Myelin figures were found in replicas of tissue treated with isoproterenol for 15 min at pH 7.4, incubated 10 min at pH 8.4, quick-frozen and then freeze-fractured, indicating that formation of myelin figures was not dependent on glutaraldehyde fixation and glycerol infiltration of the tissue. Our findings show that excess fatty acids in adipose tissue can be visualized as myelin figures if the tissue is exposed to pH 8.1–9.0 and maintained at or above pH 7.4, or as smooth-surfaced droplets if the tissue is processed at pH 7.0 or 4.5. We conclude that myelin figures formed under these conditions are composed primarily of partially ionized fatty acids (acid-soaps), and that the smooth-surfaced droplets in the extracellular space are composed of un-ionized (protonated) fatty acids.}

During these processes, the most required expectations from the system are achieving the desired quality and maintenance of the system environments. In this sense, measurement and continuous improvement of service quality are crucial for health centers to provide better service to patients. For this aim, this paper presents an integrated assessment methodology based on the distance-based Pythagorean Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, TOPSIS, and Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for the measurement of health care service quality. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, a case study is carried out by comparing the ten clinics of a private hospital. Five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) have been used as the main criteria for evaluating the service quality levels of the clinics, and multiple sub-criteria are determined for each dimension for a detailed analysis. Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS is executed to the determined decision matrices to obtain inputs of the fuzzy rule-based system. Then, the clinic's service quality levels are calculated by implementing the fuzzy inference system. Moreover, sensitivity analyses based on the changes in the decision makers' weights are also applied to check the flexibility of the results. Finally, implementations with respect to theoretical, managerial, and policy aspects are discussed based on the obtained results.}

This study improves our understanding of the relationship between TQM and innovation based on the following two major issues. First, this study contributes to the understanding of the co-alignment between TQM and technology management along with R&D management by bridging the gap between the two areas which are often addressed in a separate fashion. Second, this study also examines the impact of the integration between TQM and technology/R&D on quality and innovation performance which have been considered as the primary sources of a competitive advantage. The empirical data was drawn from 194 Australian organizations and analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique. The findings indicate that TQM shows a strong predictive power against quality performance but no significant relationship against innovation performance. On the other hand, technology and R&D management shows a significant relationship with quality performance but at a lower level than that of TQM, and shows much stronger relationship with innovation performance. In addition, there is strong and positive correlation between TQM and technology/R&D management. The major implication of this study is that technology/R&D management is an appropriate resource to be used in harmony with TQM to enhance organizational performance, particularly innovation.}

In Wodak, R. and Chilton, P. (Eds.) A New Agenda in (Critical) Discourse Analysis: Theory, Methodology and Interdisciplinarity. John Benjamins, Amsterdam, pp. 19–53, 2005], I explore language from both sides of the immigration debate to show, step by step, how a seemingly simple compound can subconsciously introduce or affirm deep value-laden judgments about both authorized and unauthorized immigrants. As such, my explanation rests on the theory of Conceptual Blending [G. Fauconnier, M. Turner, The Way We Think: Conceptual Blending and the Mind's Hidden Complexities. Basic Books, New York, 2002] in which multiple domains of knowledge including those of seafaring, immigration, and family structure blend together giving rise to a new (and offensive) concept of procreation as a tool to gain legal status, resources, and permanent ties to the U.S. I show that hidden meaning and reasoning, instinctively labeled as offensive by many, but often characterized in vague terms, can in fact be systematically described given the right conceptual framework. I propose the theory of Conceptual Blending can be utilized as a uniquely effective tool to dissect associative processes in the study of pragmatics.}

An overview of the literature is given with the identification of a gap in current literature: the patterns of supplier participation in new product development. The main goal of this article is to seek possible ways of controlling the supplier integration process in new product development. Using 12 case studies of small and medium-sized suppliers of a medium-sized European enterprise doing business in the window and facades industry, the authors recognize several problems resulting from the interaction and coordination between customer and supplier in new development processes. With reference to the problem, propositions in form of possible solutions or advice are given. A typical new product development process is illustrated in the form of a blueprint description. The results of the investigation are transferable to the new product development process of various technical products, mainly in small and medium-sized enterprises.}

For couples practicing natural family planning, a more precise identification of the fertile phase would be a welcome adjunct to their method. A home ovarian monitor invented by Professor J. B. Brown of Melbourne, Australia, enables couples to measure the principal metabolite of ovarian estrogen and prigesterone. The charted results reveal the hormonal pattern of the menstrual cycle and thus identify the beginning, peak, and end of the fertile period. A study involving 21 couples was conducted with the purpose of assessing overall acceptability, including ease of use, motivation, and client satisfaction. At the completion of the study, 12 couples indicated a high degree of motivation and satisfaction with the monitor. None reported difficulty with the test procedure. Increased confidence in natural family planning was cited as the most positive evaluation and the time required to perform the test, as the most negative.}

abstract = {The portfolio allocation problem is a hot topic in modern economics and management science. It involves many immeasurable criteria and uncertainties. Given the advantage of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) in modeling complexities and uncertainties, this study provides an integrated methodology to deal with portfolio allocation problem based on the multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method considering the consensus reaching process in an interval type-2 fuzzy environment. First, some new information measures for IT2FSs include the weighted mean, and the weighted semi-absolute deviation measures are defined. They are used to describe the return and risk of the portfolio allocation, respectively. Second, a two-stage MCGDM framework is constructed for portfolio allocation: one is to achieve the group consensus, and the other is to obtain the optimal portfolio ratios. Finally, an example on calculating the optimal portfolio ratios for four newly listed stocks in China is offered to elaborate on the performance of our approach. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are also given to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The use of trade-off analysis as part of optimising designs has been an emerging technique for a number of years. However, only recently has much work been done with respect to systematically deriving the understanding of the system problem to be optimised and using this information as part of the design process. As systems have become larger and more complex then a need has arisen for suitable approaches. The system problem consists of design choices, measures for individual values related to quality attributes and weights to balance the relative importance of each individual quality attribute. In this paper, a method is presented for establishing an understanding of a system problem using the goal structuring notation (GSN). The motivation for this work is borne out of experience working on embedded systems in the context of critical systems where the cost of change can be large and the impact of design errors potentially catastrophic. A particular focus is deriving an understanding of the problem so that different solutions can be assessed quantitatively, which allows more definitive choices to be made. A secondary benefit is it also enables design using heuristic search approaches which is another area of our research. The overall approach is demonstrated through a case study which is a task allocation problem.}

To date, two aggregation functions have been developed for the MoI, one representing a compensating strategy and one a non-compensating strategy. Much of the prior fuzzy sets research on aggregation functions has been inappropriate for application to engineering design. In this paper, the selection of an aggregation function for MADM schemes is discussed within the context of the MoI. The general restrictions on design-appropriate aggregation functions are outlined, and a family of functions, modeling a range of trade-off strategies, is presented.

Although fuzzy decision models have been widely used to capture potential uncertainty by assigning a fuzzy term with the certain belief, the ambiguity subjective evaluation of semantic variables with conflict beliefs derived from DMs have not been well addressed. To solve this drawback, a concept decision model based on Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory and intuitionistic fuzzy -Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) considering the ambiguity semantic variables fusion is proposed. Firstly, by incorporating semantic variables of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), the diversified semantic judgments and its belief will be taken into account to form an ambiguity semantic initial decision matrix; secondly, the DS combination rule will be used to fuse the different semantic variables of multi-DMs in each scheme, update the belief of each semantic variable, and then the semantic fusion value matrix of the scheme will be constructed; finally, the weight of each evaluation objective will be calculated based on the value matrix and information entropy model, IFS-VIKOR model will be constructed to rank the concepts. A case study of the tree climbing and trimming machine will be employed to verify the proposed decision model. This decision model considering diversifying semantic variables and the conflict belief is proven to be effective compared with the IFS-SAW and ISF-TOPSIS.}

The connection oriented broad band data is used to find the performance of the chosen algorithms.

The co-implementation is a specific way of co-creation to generate value for customer and supplier in smart PSS. Meanwhile, the service failures in co-implementation can bring about service paradox. As such, three key research questions, including the construction of co-implementation of smart PSS, the extension of risk factors in FMECA and the category of identified failure modes, are put forward and conquered by a proposed methodological framework. First, in order to construct the co-implementation of smart PSS involving customer and supplier, the PCN (process-chain-network) diagram with direct interaction, surrogate interaction and independent handling is employed to reflect the nature of interaction. Second, since that the highly complexity of co-implementation of smart PSS can lead to more huge risk, an extended-FMECA (failure mode effect and criticality analysis) sheet is formulated by considering the adaptation of autonomy. Third, to handle the uncertainty of expert judgments more reasonably and determine the weights of risk factors without additional information, a hybrid approach integrating rough-entropy-ELECTRE TRI is proposed to classify failure modes into ordinal classes, so that decision-makers can swiftly access them. This proposed methodological framework also is illustrated by the co-implementation of smart fridge-service system, in which the feasibility and superiority are verified by analysing comparative results.}

Such outsourcing has often resulted in complex supply chain configurations. Because social and environmental regulations in those countries are often weak or poorly enforced, stakeholders impose responsibility on focal companies to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable production standards throughout their supply chains. In this paper, we present an integrated fuzzy AHP-VIKOR approach-based framework for sustainable global supplier selection that takes sustainability risks from sub-suppliers (i.e., (1+n)th-tier suppliers) into account. Sustainability criteria (including risk concerns) were identified from the existing literature and were further narrowed with the assistance of field experts and case decision makers to remove any literature bias. Then, based on the finalized sustainability criteria, suppliers and sub-suppliers were evaluated altogether. In previous studies, this approach was limited. The problem is addressed in two stages as follows. In the first stage, fuzzy AHP is used to generate criteria weights for sustainable global supplier selection, and in the second stage, fuzzy VIKOR is used to rate supplier performances against the evaluation criteria. Among five sustainability criteria (economic, quality, environment, social, and global risk), economic criteria demonstrated the greatest weight and global risk displayed the least weight. This result clearly shows that global risks are still not considered a major criterion for supplier selection. Further, the proposed framework may serve as a starting point for developing managerial decision-making tools to help companies more effectively address sustainability risks occurring further upstream in their supply chains. These vital tools are particularly important if focal companies are under intense scrutiny by their stakeholders.}

Moreover, by investigating further in the buyer-supplier relationships, the literature suggests that proper communication and structured information exchange are important components in establishing a long-term partnership and maintaining such a relationship. Toward this end, a Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) approach is proposed as a mean of automating and facilitating the process of sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SSS&OA) resulting in a more co-operative partnership. This research shows that financial performance of manufacturing companies adopting environmental and social sustainability in their operations strategy enhanced their competitive advantage that can lead to long-term sourcing relationships for the buyer-supplier dyad. Additionally, it was also shown that applying MASs to the SSS&OA problem can be utilized as an approach to facilitate communications and automate information exchange processes in Supply Chains (SCs) where suppliers and manufacturer are looking to maintain a long-term SC partnership. The applicability of the developed MAS approach and its incorporated sustainable supplier evaluation and order allocation models is demonstrated using an adopted practical scenario from an industrial case study operating in the electronics sector in medical device industry.}

abstract = {Supplier selection is an important strategic decision in the context of supply chain management. Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers.}

However, the outcomes of previous methods are likely to reveal no more than current key technologies, since they can only be performed at later stages of technology development due to the time required for patents to be cited (or fail to be cited). This study proposes a machine learning approach to identifying emerging technologies at early stages using multiple patent indicators that can be defined immediately after the relevant patents are issued. For this, first, a total of 18 input and 3 output indicators are extracted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database. Second, a feed-forward multilayer neural network is employed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between input and output indicators in a time period of interest. Finally, two quantitative indicators are developed to identify trends of a technology's emergingness over time. Based on this, we also provide the practical guidelines for implementation of the proposed approach. The case of pharmaceutical technology shows that our approach can facilitate responsive technology forecasting and planning.}

They rely on the assumption that following a certain process of reasoning might lead to generating ideas considered creative. We start by defining creativity as a capability that enables the creation of systems that are patentable. We review the state-of-the-art of creative conceptual design and organize it with a framework. Subsequently, we present a method called infused design that guarantees the generation of design solutions by transforming systems and methods from remote disciplines. In many cases, these solutions would be deemed creative. Finding these systems and their transformations is done through a process based on the underlying discrete mathematical representation. This process is partially supported by a computer tool. We describe the method of infused design and illustrate its operation through part of the results achieved until now, including designing a new active torque amplifier system. We further demonstrate its benefits through other examples. We discuss the relation of infused design with other creativity or design methods and conclude with future developments of the method. “A well-directed imagination is the source of great deeds.” Chinese proverb}

In requirements engineering, there will be many different stake holders. Often the requirements engineer has to find a set of requirements that reflect the needs of several different stake holders, while remaining within budget.
Objective
This paper introduces an optimisation-based approach to the automated analysis of requirements assignments when multiple stake holders are to be satisfied by a single choice of requirements.
Method
The paper reports on experiments using two different multi-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithms with real world data sets as well as synthetic data sets. This empirical validation includes a statistical analysis of the performance of the two algorithms.
Results
The results reveal that the Two-Archive algorithm outperformed the others in convergence as the scale of problems increase. The paper also shows how both traditional and animated Kiviat diagrams can be used to visualise the tensions between the stake holders’ competing requirements in the presence of increasing budgetary pressure.
Conclusion
This paper presented the concept of internal tensioning among multi-stakeholder in requirements analysis and optimisation for the first time. This analysis may be useful in internal negotiations over budgetary allowance for the project.}

The proposed FMEA measures the maximum and minimum risks of each failure mode. The two risks are then geometrically averaged to measure the overall risks of failure modes. The risk priorities are determined in terms of overall risks rather than maximum or minimum risks only. Two numerical examples are provided and examined using the proposed FMEA to show its potential applications and benefits.}

This paper will argue that TQM plays a prominent role in organizations who have adopted a positive approach in their AMT implementation strategy and where AMT projects were not introduced solely for local or economic benefits. The paper will also discuss that in cases where AMT was brought in as a direct replacement for old equipment, TQM tends to have little visibility, since the practices of ‘Business as usual’ are still inherent. The paper concludes by presenting an effective model of AMT implementation which is compatible with the philosophy of TQM and its principles.}

We have recently shown that a subgroup of endothelial-like cells from the bovine corpus luteum maintains cytokeratin (CK) expression in long-term culture. Treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for three days brought about an increase in the intercellular junctions in CK-positive post-confluent cultures, as shown by immunofluorescence with specific monoclonal antibodies and by electron microscopy. Desmosomes, zonulae adhaerentes and both tight and gap junctions were found. The intercellular junctions (excluding the gap junctions) had increased in amount, while permeability of the cell layer to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) had decreased. Hence, IFN-γ has reinforced intercellular junctions in our CK-positive endothelial-like cells.}

A new model is proposed here which incorporates damage. It uses an incremental self-consistent method developed previously. In the new application, the model treats damaged and undamaged regions as distinct continuous “phases” and allows the relative volume fraction of each phase to vary during deformation. The stress redistribution due to damage during the evolution is carefully analysed. The model considers the influence of particle sizevia a Weibull analysis and incorporates the results of existing FEM calculations. The model agrees well with existing experimental data and provides a new method to evaluate the role of microstructural parameters.

Through a review of the literature, eight CSFs for the successful implementation of BPM are identified. To help advance research on the implementation of BPM, this paper uses multi-site field study data with a novel grey-based DEMATEL (the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) approach to visualize the structure of complicated causal relationships between these CSFs and obtain the influence level of these factors. The field study data uses three Chinese manufacturers as the setting. The four most important factors found in the field study, from amongst the identified CSFs, include Strategic alignment, Top management support, Project management and a Collaborative environment. We also found a number of direct and indirect relationships amongst the CSF factors. Insights into the application of the technique and results from both a research and managerial perspective are presented.

However, the protection of the environment is one of the main factors that should be considered based on environmental protection regulations of countries. In this paper, environmental concerns are considered in formulating a mathematical model to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. We develop a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization of facilities. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, we design a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada. A solution approach based on augmented ε-constraint method is employed to solve the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions gives decision-makers the opportunity to make a trade-off between economic, environmental, and capacity utilization objectives. Our example shows that it is possible to keep emissions reasonably low without incurring high total costs. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.}

In this study, using a developed integrated fuzzy decision-making methodology, the green marketing risk factors in the dairy industry are assessed. Firstly, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used for weighting the identified risk assessment criteria. Then, a weighted fuzzy inference system is proposed for green marketing risk assessment. Finally, risk mitigation strategies are proposed to deal with the highly ranked risk factors. This research study fills the gaps in the literature by (1) proposing a comprehensive list of green marketing risk factors in the dairy industry, (2) developing a novel weighted fuzzy inference system approach for assessing those risk factors, and (3) providing a final ranking of the dairy industry risk factors together with risk mitigation strategies for the highly ranked risk factors. The level of environmental awareness in society was found as the most important risk factor followed by governmental policies, rules, and regulations for supporting green products risk factors. Finally, some remarks are concluded together with presenting the future works.}

In the present study, we have investigated the interaction of the anticarcinogenic BBI with intestinal epithelial cells. At the concentrations examined, BBI was non-toxic and had no effect on the doubling time, saturation density or rate of DNA synthesis by these cells. This compound was taken up by these cells in a time dependent manner and was present in the cells for 12 h following a 2 h incubation with BBI. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that the bulk of the internalised inhibitor was present in the cytosol. Analysis of BBI from treated cells on a chymotrypsin affinity column revealed that active inhibitor was present in the cells. Our results indicate that the BBI is internalised by colonic epithelial cells which would allow BBI to inhibit critical intracellular proteases and thus suppress malignant transformation.}

Different from other existing selection procedures, in which decisions are based mainly on the projects’ characteristics at decision points, the proposed procedure takes into account projects’ historical performances. In particular, projects are first evaluated and assigned comparable scores, based on which a multi-objective model is built. The model selects a portfolio with a view to maximizing its expected value and development trend, while minimizing its risk with other selected projects. Three important elements are considered: (1) criteria weighting over each other, (2) uncertainty in decision making, and (3) projects’ historical performances. The aim is to select more robust project portfolios in the long run, which lead to fewer replacements. Comparative studies are performed to verify the validity of the approach. It is shown that our method can lead to more robust portfolios in a shorter time, which can aid decision makers throughout the selection process.}

Studies presented in the literature propose the use of the methods Fuzzy TOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and Fuzzy AHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) to aid the supplier selection decision process. However, there are no comparative studies of these two methods when applied to the problem of supplier selection. Thus, this paper presents a comparative analysis of these two methods in the context of supplier selection decision making. The comparison was made based on the factors: adequacy to changes of alternatives or criteria; agility in the decision process; computational complexity; adequacy to support group decision making; the number of alternative suppliers and criteria; and modeling of uncertainty. As an illustrative example, both methods were applied to the selection of suppliers of a company in the automotive production chain. In addition, computational tests were performed considering several scenarios of supplier selection. The results have shown that both methods are suitable for the problem of supplier selection, particularly to supporting group decision making and modeling of uncertainty. However, the comparative analysis has shown that the Fuzzy TOPSIS method is better suited to the problem of supplier selection in regard to changes of alternatives and criteria, agility and number of criteria and alternative suppliers. Thus, this comparative study contributes to helping researchers and practitioners to choose more effective approaches for supplier selection. Suggestions of further work are also proposed so as to make these methods more adequate to the problem of supplier selection.}

To accelerate and improve eco-innovative design, there is a need for the computer aided eco-innovation tools to support engineers in the preliminary design phase. Currently, several computer aided innovation tools with a clear focus on specific innovation tasks exist but very few of them deal with the eco-innovation issues. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to present the development of a computer aided model based preliminary design methodology focused on technological eco-innovation for chemical engineering. This methodology is based on modified tools of the structured TRIZ theory. The general systematic framework gives the same level of importance, to the technological and environmental requirements during the conceptual design phase. Integrating environment oriented design approach at the earliest, in the design phase, is essential for product effectiveness and future development. The methodology employs a decomposition based solution approach in hierarchical steps by analysing the problem faced, formulation of the problem and the generation of possible and feasible ideas. At each step, various methods and tools will be needed. In this paper some existing tools are adapted to chemical engineering and some tools of the structured TRIZ theory are modified and improved to build a specific methodology oriented towards the increasing technological complexity and environmental issues of current designs. Undoubtedly, the selection of materials and substances for a particular generated concept, mainly affects the structure, mechanical factors (processability and dimensions) and the environmental impact. In order to deal with these environmental criteria, the resources and their impacts are considered in the upstream phase of the design process and are introduced as constraints in our model. To highlight its capabilities, the methodology is illustrated through a case study dedicated to tars and ashes issues in biomass gasification.}

abstract = {This paper aims at integrating data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the economic development achieved by local governments in China. Since most similar evaluations are multi-objection problems, which both DEA and AHP are capable of solving, the integration of these two approaches is shown to be even more powerful. The proposed integrated DEA/AHP model can evaluate and rank different alternatives. In addition, a time-scale comparison of the economic performances of local governments in China was carried out using the malmquist productivity index (MPI), which indicated that there is a trend of economic growth. However, empirical results indicate that after discounting the advantages of location and political connections, the east district provinces of China do not have superior economic performance or a better MPI index, as compared with other districts. This result is contrary to our original hypothesis.}

abstract = {A simple practical framework for predictive maintenance (PdM)-based scheduling of multi-state systems (MSS) is developed. The maintenance schedules are derived from a system-perspective using the failure times of the overall system as estimated from its performance degradation trends. The system analyzed in this work is a flow transmission water pipe system. The various factors influencing PdM-based scheduling are identified and their impact on the system reliability and performance are quantitatively studied. The estimated times to replacement of the MSS may also be derived from the developed model. The results of the model simulation demonstrate the significant impact of maintenance quality and the criteria for the call for maintenance (user demand) on the system reliability and mean performance characteristics. A slight improvement in maintenance quality is found to postpone the system replacement time by manifold. The consistency in the quality of maintenance work with minimal variance is also identified as a very important factor that enhances the system's future operational and downtime event predictability. The studies also reveal that in order to reduce the frequency of maintenance actions, it is necessary to lower the minimum user demand from the system if possible, ensuring at the same time that the system still performs its intended function effectively. The model proposed can be utilized to implement a PdM program in the industry with a few modifications to suit the individual industrial systems’ needs.}

The philosophy that all types of automation will benefit the organization is now being seriously contested in the literature. The researchers found that best practice companies are finding new ways of automating processes and consequently gaining a long-term strategic advantage. The best practice companies included in this project considered automation to be a central element of strategic and operations planning, people management and facility design. Many of these organizations used lean production techniques to improve the implementation and operation of automated manufacturing systems. These companies placed emphasis on the automation of the process rather than on automating existing processes. The best practice organizations achieved this by involving people at the basic design and planning stages and using logical processes to identify the most suitable processes for automation. Companies wishing to gain a competitive advantage from automation should adopt comprehensive worker involvement programmes, introduce the automation of processes slowly and incrementally, whilst increasing the flow of ideas across work boundaries. Planning for automation in an organization must start at the strategic planning stage and then incorporate all phases of the management process including planning, leading, resource allocation and control systems.}

To improve the performance and sustainability of logistics processes, managers should analyze the risks in such processes and implement risk mitigation measures to reduce their negative impact on system integrity. The adoption of new technologies in risk mitigation planning can help managers improve the performance of logistics processes. This study proposes a sequential dynamic approach for analyzing the risks and assessing the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures in an uncertain environment. The causal relationships between risks of logistics processes are extracted after the risk identification based on the process-oriented perspective. Afterward, a multi-expertise team employs the Z-number theory-based linguistic variables to determine the value of triple risk parameters for each risk (i.e., probabilities of destructiveness, occurrence, and undetectability). In this phase, the multi-expertise team’s opinions are aggregated using an extended version of Dempster-Shafer’s evidence theory in the Z-number environment to consider uncertainty and reliability simultaneously. Then, the sequential dynamic model of the identified risks is developed using the Bayesian belief network. This model enables decision-makers to identify the critical risks in each logistics sub-process and assess risk mitigation measures, defined by focusing on new technologies. The proposed model is used to estimate the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures after determining the impressionable risks in their implementation. The results of this study imply that new technology-based solutions can improve critical sub-processes (i.e., resource planning, procurement, and production planning) significantly.}

In this paper, in order to examine service development as practice, we draw on extensive ethnographic material covering an entire service development process. Through a rhetorical lens, we identify what types of customer-related arguments the project members use in order to drive the development process forward and confront these findings with service development literature. We find that customer orientation is rhetorically present mostly when it comes to what the team should do (i.e. appeals to ethos, expressed as identification with the customer but also as guilt). However, this type of rhetoric does not lead to action as prescribed by normative marketing literature – such as formal acquisition of and reliance on market research – due to more decisive arguments about resources.}

abstract = {While some degree of freedom and flexibility is an essential ingredient to productive cross-functional NPD teams, upper-managers are faced with the challenge of instituting effective control mechanisms which head projects in the right strategic direction, monitor progress toward organizational and project goals, and allow for adjustments in the project if necessary. But too much or the wrong type of control may constrain the team’s creativity, impede their progress, and injure their ultimate performance. Therefore, this study examines formal and interactive control mechanisms available to upper-managers in controlling new product development (NPD) projects, and the relationship between these mechanisms and NPD project performance. Formal output and process controls are examined which consist of the setting and monitoring of outcomes, such as goals, schedule and budgets, and of processes and procedures, respectively. This study also looks at how the effectiveness of these control mechanisms may be contingent upon the degree of innovativeness in the project and the degree to which the project is part of a broad product program. In addition, the use of formal rewards for achieving team performance as opposed to rewards for individual achievement is investigated. Lastly, interactive controls are examined which consist of upper-managers interacting directly with project members in the development of strategy and operational goals and procedures prior to the start of the project, and upper-managers intervening in project decision-making. Questionnaire data are collected on 95 projects across a variety of industries. The findings suggest that while NPD projects teams need some level of strategic direction concerning the objectives to be accomplished and the procedures to be followed, upper-level managers can exert too much control. In particular, the findings showed a negative association between the use of upper manager-imposed process controls and project performance. The findings also indicated that the degree to which upper-managers intervened in project-level decisions during the project was negatively related to project performance. However, the results showed support for the notion that early and interactive decision-making on control mechanisms is important for effective projects. In particular, early team member and upper-management involvement in the setting of operational controls, such as goals and procedures for monitoring and evaluating the project, was positively associated with project performance. This study provides additional insight into our understanding of upper-management support in new product development. The study suggests that upper-managers can over control with the wrong type of controls, and suggests effective ways of implementing participative and interactive control mechanisms.}

Material selection for such cases should be performed with sensitivity and using a systematic method. Moreover, various risks may exist about the values of materials properties. For example, the difference between the designed and unexpected conditions may pose some risks to materials properties. Although considering risks for gas turbine blade material selection problem or similar high-tech practical cases is important, a research gap exists in such fields. This paper presents a risk-based material selection algorithm using the principles of Suh and Shannon entropies supported on information theory. In this regard, we develop the risk-based fuzzy axiomatic design approach with the integrated Shannon significance coefficients of attributes. A real-world example about material selection of industrial gas turbine blade is examined using four techniques including the fuzzy axiomatic design, weighted fuzzy axiomatic design, risk-based fuzzy axiomatic design, and weighted risk-based fuzzy axiomatic design approaches. In the example, risk factors are determined to consider the effect of temperature variation on materials properties. Finally, the resultant rankings are compared by calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The comparisons show that considering risk factors in the problem affects the resultant ranking. We validate the results of the proposed methods by the unweighted and weighted fuzzy MULTIMOORA approaches.}

While AHP has been thoroughly researched and applied, the method still shows limitations in terms of addressing user profile disparities. A novel sensitivity analysis method based on local partial derivatives is presented here to address these limitations. This new methodology informs AHP users of which pairwise comparisons most impact the derived weights and the ranking of alternatives. The method can also be applied to decision processes that require the aggregation of results obtained by several users, as it highlights which individuals most critically impact the aggregated group results while also enabling to focus on inputs that drive the final ordering of alternatives. An aerospace design and engineering example that requires group decision making is presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed methodology.}

In addressing these issues, organizations worldwide have taken initiatives in adopting sustainability practices in their supply chain transferring it to sustainable supply chain management. In order to establish a responsible sustainable supply chain management, an effective way would be to make sure that the potential suppliers for procuring required components are precisely assessed and evaluated based on sustainable criteria. Therefore, this paper proposes a practical decision making approach to evaluate and select the most sustainable suppliers for an automotive spare part manufacturer licensed under a France-based automotive organization. Firstly, a requirement gathering approach, the audition check-list approach, is designed to facilitate the process of data gathering for supplier evaluation based on three pillars of sustainability. Next, the gathered data are processed using a proposed fuzzy inference system to remove impreciseness and vagueness in the gathered sustainability related data. The strength of this model falls into its applicability in data gathering phase which helps decision makers in manufacturing company to perform a fast audition of a typical supplier. Secondly, the final sustainable ranking of suppliers using the proposed fuzzy inference system provide a precise and less uncertain sustainability performance scoring which makes the developed approach a reliable system for making sustainable sourcing decisions. Comparison and sensitivity analysis are performed to evaluate the proficiency of the developed approach. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications together with conclusions of the study are presented.}

We model firms’ abilities to collectively collaborate with suppliers, customers, and internal employee teams in NPD as collaborative competence and examine its impact on project and market performance. Using responses collected from 189 NPD managers, we find empirical evidence for collaborative competence and its differential impact on project and market performance. Specifically, we find that collaborative competence has a direct impact on project performance, but its impact on market performance is indirect, mediated through project performance. The results have significant managerial implications; achieving superior market performance from inter- and intra-organizational involvement is contingent on achieving superior project performance, and companies that fail to achieve desired project performance outcomes will also fail in achieving market performance goals.}

In the case of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), achieving potential social goals regarding human health, climate, air quality and energy requires many more households become PEV owners and users than have so far. Workshops were convened with PEV owners and owners of internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicles (collectively, non-PEVs) in three regions throughout California representing different levels of PEV sales and charging infrastructure deployment. Participants guided the creation of their workshop’s agenda: non-PEV owners stated their questions about PEVs; PEV owners added more they wanted to tell about PEVs and about themselves becoming and being PEV owners. In the subsequent conversations, PEV owners constructed “accounts”—both in the sense of (informally) tallying the costs of buying a PEV and in the sense of telling a story of their lives with PEVs. Their storytelling conveyed the signs of PEVs: how PEVs, charging infrastructure, and incentives are (to PEV owners) an obvious suite of symbols and what those symbols mean (to PEV owners). In effect, the PEV owners teach the owners of non-PEVs a new symbol system and in doing so enhance the non-PEV owners’ ability to see, hear, and interpret the signs of PEVs. Routinely, but not universally, among the non-PEV owners learning the symbol system of PEVs produces more positive evaluations of PEVs.}

abstract = {How to select the suitable suppliers in the supply chain is critical for an organization’s success and has attracted much attention of both researchers and practitioners. Supplier selection can be regarded as a complex group multiple criteria decision making problem requiring consideration of a number of alternative suppliers and quantitative and qualitative criteria. Additionally, decision makers cannot easily express their judgments on the alternatives with exact numerical values in many practical situations, and there usually exists uncertain and incomplete assessments. In response, this paper proposes an extended VIKOR method for group multi-criteria supplier selection with interval 2-tuple linguistic information. The feasibility and practicability of the proposed interval 2-tuple linguistic VIKOR (ITL-VIKOR) method are demonstrated through three realistic supplier selection examples and comparisons with the existing approaches. Results show that the ITL-VIKOR method being proposed is more suitable and effective to handle the supplier selection problem under vague, uncertain and incomplete information environment.}

The evaluation of its therapeutic effects was performed in this study of 76 9- to 10-year-old patients (at the beginning of treatment). The treated subjects were separated into two groups: group A (bioactivator only) and group B (bioactivator plus headgear). Group C comprised 14 untreated subjects selected as controls. Various statistical assessments were made to separate growth phenomena from treatment effects. It appears that the bioactivator has an effect not only on the dentition but also on the skeletal structures. In both treated groups, the maxillary changes were related to an increased anterior vertical growth and a posterior sagittal growth. The addition of extraoral force helped to achieve a posterior rotation of the upper jaw. When only the bioactivator was worn, the mandibular changes were more vertical than sagittal. The lower jaw appeared more forward, however. When the bioactivator and the headgear force were used simultaneously, the therapeutic effects seemed to be more sagittal than vertical, as if the occipitally directed force vector inhibits or at least exerts a control on the downward growth tendency. Without being significantly different statistically from one to the other, the treated groups showed a marked improvement of the sagittal jaw discrepancy.}

abstract = {The selection of an optimal, efficient and reliable transport and logistics policy is one of the most important factors in supply chain management and logistics planning. Given that decision making in transport and logistics involves the consideration of a number of opposite criteria and possible solutions, such a selection can be considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This study presents a new integrated approach to decision making, i.e. the generation of a robust decision making rule (RDMR) by combining different MCDM methods and Taguchi's robust quality engineering principles. As a logical implication of the proposed approach, a conceptual model of an adaptive and interactive expert system is developed. Its purpose is to enhance the decision making process through enabling the decision maker to: (i) use higher level knowledge regarding the selection of criteria weights and MCDM methods, (ii) estimate the ranking of a new alternative, which can be added to the initial decision matrix after a posteriori analysis of the final rankings of alternatives, and, moreover, quantify its distance from the ideal and the anti-ideal solution. Five different case studies in the field of transport and logistics were considered in order to illustrate the proposed approach. The obtained results and the results of the other MCDM methods were compared using Kendall's tau-b and Spearman's rho tests. An analysis of the final rank stability with respect to the changes in criteria weights was also performed so as to assess the sensitivity of the alternative rankings obtained by the application of different MCDM methods and the proposed approach. To this aim, the Monte Carlo simulation was conducted covering 1000 different scenarios of criteria weights in three different cases. Finally, an additional procedure was introduced for an explicit representation of an RDMR using the design of experiments (DOE) principles.}

Stochastic methods are proposed since the design process is immersed in ambiguity and uncertainty, both of which vary with time as knowledge increases about the system behavior. The specific task addressed in this paper of examining system feasibility and viability is encapsulated in the five steps of the Concept Feasibility Assessment approach. The rationale and technical foundations of each step are explained, and the approach is compared to more traditional, deterministic means for examining a design space and evaluating technology impacts. Finally, the techniques are implemented on a supersonic transport design problem to highlight the power of the approach on a problem of significant interest to the international aerospace community. Several innovative avenues for viewing the design and technology spaces are employed in assessing first feasibility and then viability for the problem.}

Empirical evidence on these relationships is mixed and highly dependent on the size and duration of the outage, the geographic area considered, the level of inventories available at the time of the outage, and the tightness of the market as measured by the capacity utilization rate. Using a detailed database of plant-level refinery outages for both upstream and downstream refining units, I estimate the effects of outages on product prices controlling for the crude oil price and the ability of operating plants to respond to the outage. I also consider the effect of current market profitability on the likelihood of planned refinery outages and the effects of high utilization rates and planned maintenance on the prospects for unplanned outages. I then use plant-level capacity data to analyze the effects of outages, profitability, and utilization rates on future investment decisions of the refinery. Results based on probit and hazard models show that planned outages tend to occur during the spring and fall and during times of relatively low margins as measured by the crack spread, while unplanned outages are negatively associated with the capacity utilization rate. Price regressions show that atmospheric distillation and catalytic cracking outages are positively associated with gasoline prices and the association is stronger the higher is the utilization rate at the time of the outage. The relationship between both upstream and downstream investment and outages is mixed though refiners tend to invest less when nearby plants have made investments in the prior year. While causal relationships between outages, prices, and investment are difficult to estimate due to simultaneity and unobserved variables, these descriptive results show that outages are an important factor affecting refined product prices and future refinery investment.}

ESG environmental, social, and governance research can help managers make informed decisions so that managers can better choose the corresponding operating strategies, pay attention to environmental protection, and actively fulfill social responsibilities. We consider matching strategies between manufacturers and retailers by classifying them into no matching, decentralized matching, and centralized matching strategies between manufacturers and retailers. Under the matching strategy, we consider the decentralized ESG operation strategy and centralized ESG operation strategy, divide the decentralized ESG strategy into a supplier-dominant mode (SD), manufacturer-dominant mode (MD), and retailer-dominant mode (RD), and study the optimal decision-making methods of supply chain members in different modes. The innovation of this study lies in (1) considering financing constraints; (2) the impact of indicators on society and the environment; (3) no matching strategy, decentralized matching strategy, and considerations of centralized matching strategy; (4) decentralized and centralized strategies under relevant ESG indicators to improve the accuracy of the model; (5) the decentralized ESG operation strategy is divided into a supplier-dominant mode (SD), manufacturer-dominant mode (MD), and retailer- dominant mode (RD); and (6) Applying the ESG strategy to Pharmaceutical supply chain Management. The different models are compared and analyzed to find the equilibrium strategy and the optimal solution under different models. Through various analysis, we found that integrating a pharmaceutical supply chain and the ESG governance strategy can effectively promote the innovation of the industrial chain supply chain. A supply chain matching strategy is more effective in managing a supply chain than a no-matching strategy and can improve the financing efficiency of capital-constrained manufacturers. In the matching strategy, centralized matching can better attract consumers who prefer green and “double carbon” products than decentralized matching. Under the lower level of green investment, the centralized ESG governance strategy can better contribute to developing the pharmaceutical supply chain.}

Selecting RER is a complex problem involving different criteria and alternatives. The first aim of the study is the development of an evaluation model to select the most appropriate RER in Turkey. Evaluation of RER alternatives can be seen as a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem that can be solved with flexible tools to handle complex situations and assist decision makers (DMs) in mapping out the situation. In this process, Group Decision Making (GDM) involves multiple DMs who have different goals or ways of thinking and can assess the decision process distinctively different from others. Linguistic interval fuzzy preferences with DEMATEL, ANP, TOPSIS integrated techniques are utilized to eliminate uncertainty and to better represent DMs' preferences. The originality of the paper comes from its ability to propose effective and comprehensive evaluation model for both Turkey and literature and apply to a real industrial problem to improve the RER selection process. Another contribution is to adapt integrated techniques including linguistic interval fuzzy preferences with DEMATEL, ANP, TOPSIS for the first time.}

Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV) and taking mixed methods research design approach this study develops and validates an instrument for measuring supply chain sustainability (SCS) in the context of apparel industry of a developing country. It then investigates the conditional direct and indirect effect of supply chain sustainability on performance through reducing sustainability risks at different levels of sustainability governance. Our findings suggest that SCS is a multidimensional construct consisting of four dimensions: social, environmental, economic (financial) and economic (production). The measurement instrument of SCS also satisfactorily correlates to the “technical” and “evolutionary” criteria of DCV. The findings also affirms that the conditional indirect effect of SCS on market performance via reducing sustainability risk is significant at higher levels of sustainability governance. This study contributes significantly to the body of knowledge by developing and validating a multidimensional scale of supply chain sustainability (SCS) and investigating its impact on market performance through a mediated-moderated modelling approach. In practice, the supply chain managers will be able to adopt appropriate SCS practices and governance mechanism to reduce sustainability risks and improve market performance.

abstract = {Within dynamic innovation networks of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), complementarity between innovation partners is central to extend firm-level resources and capabilities and create synergies at the network level. Few guidelines exist for how information systems (IS) can be used to achieve fit between innovation partners. We conduct qualitative case studies of three innovation networks and investigate information technology (IT) affordances that undergird complementary activities. We provide evidence for three areas of fit and identify IT-based affordances, which foster synergy creation. These areas provide stimulus for developing IS strategies to networked innovation. We offer a conceptual model of how complementarity in SME innovation networks can be supported with the help of interorganizational systems.}

Threonine synthase from A. thaliana was shown to be synthesized with a transit peptide. The recombinant protein is activated by Sadenosylmethionine in the same range as the plant threonine synthase and evidence is presented for an involvement of the N-terminal part of the mature enzyme in the sensitivity to Sadenosylmethionine.}

abstract = {The importance–performance analysis (IPA) model has been widely used as the primary tool for customer satisfaction management. IPA is a 2-D matrix analysis based on the importance and performance of the organization from the customer perception of quality. The firm’s customer satisfaction management strategy is formulated according to the IPA analysis results. However, both conventional and modified IPA models have important hidden assumptions: (1) assumptions regarding the importance of quality characteristics and performance; (2) the assumption that performance and satisfaction have a linear relationship; (3) that quality characteristics are mutually independent variables, with no causal relationship. Under these assumptions, if the quality characteristics cannot meet the above-mentioned assumptions, the conventional and modified IPA models will not accurately analyze the importance and priority ranking for improvement, leading to wrongful decision making. This study puts forth a new decision making and analysis methodology that will, on one hand, exploit the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish quality characteristics and the hidden important integral satisfaction assumptions. The decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to calculate the causal relationship and extent of mutual influence among the qualities to adjust the importance of the quality characteristics and identify the core Order-Winners and Qualifiers problems. The proposed method modifies the quality importance and improves the IPA model ranking and also resolves difficult practical problems with fewer resources. This study illustrates using Taiwan industrial computer, working in conjunction with IPA models established with BPNN and DEMATEL to observe its application and effect.}

abstract = {Patrons not only want a good meal while dining but also a pleasant experience. Restaurants are dimensional in their ability to provide for this experience. The purpose of this research is to determine why people have interests in the fun experience factor that some restaurants provide. In this study we explore the hedonic and utilitarian motives for patrons dining in fun experience restaurants. It is necessary to apply these principles to the investigation of this study as consumers dine to satisfy hunger and to experience a more memorable experience. It is essential to examine both these values for a more meaningful study. Surveys were administered to a convenience sample of 287 participants at a fun experience restaurant in the metropolitan area. Crosstabs, ANOVA, Correlations, Factor Analysis and Multiple Regression were employed to explore differences and relationships between variables. Findings identified a profile of patrons at fun experience restaurants using the involvement construct, and the hedonic and utilitarian motivational motives, results of this study indicate the primary reasons for patronage at fun experience restaurants. Furthermore, motivational factors with various restaurant characteristics were found to understand what patrons’ value most about this experience. This paper provides the restaurant industry with insight and understanding as to what attracts patrons to fun experiment establishments and what motivations influences their decisions.}

abstract = {Conceptual ecological models (CEM) respond to the need for improved management of natural resources due to increasing scale and severity of human impacts. CEMs, like the EBM-DPSER framework, serve as non-quantitative planning tools identifying stressors and drivers on natural systems, effects and biological indicators best suited to show these effects. A disadvantage of CEMs is their non-quantitative nature restraining users from performing sensitivity and quantitative scenario analysis. Here we develop a quantitative extension of a EBM-DPSER model of the SE Florida shelf based on the assumption that the CEM flow diagrams express as digraphs. It was quantified with transition weights from literature research and local data, turning the digraph into a network. The usefulness of the network extension and its underlying weighted adjacency matrix were verified using monitoring data from the Florida Keys Reef Tract. The network extension was then used to explore outcomes of two different management scenarios. Model results suggest that advanced waste water treatment in SE Florida would increase reef diversity and framework growth and could reduce macroalgae cover while increasing coral cover, fish and shellfish abundance and eliminating phytoplankton blooms. Climate change is projected to have an effect on sea level rise, acidification and bleaching but probably with a minor influence on coral cover, reef framework and diversity – which are already low. Tested scenarios show that the modeled impact of regulation processes can vary profoundly even if the number of arcs and vertices in their largest possible out-tree are comparable. Such a tool extends the power of the conceptual model by adding significant new information and the ability to quantifiably test of hypotheses.}

abstract = {Industry 5.0 has introduced a novel interpretation of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) that emphasizes the importance of building a transparent and trustworthy network that can be continuously monitored and controlled through stakeholder collaboration as well as the use of advanced, intelligent machinery. The ultimate goal of SSCs is to meet specific economic, social, and environmental standards. The implementation of blockchain technology can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of the information exchanged among stakeholders in SSCs. However, these stakeholders inevitably possess varying informational advantages and exhibit divergent perspectives regarding the adoption of blockchain technology. This paper thus aims to examine the impediments to the adoption of blockchain technology in the context of SSCs with the goal of promoting blockchain adoption. To achieve this objective, this study analyzes the barriers to blockchain adoption from the perspectives of various stakeholders in SSCs and constructs a barrier severity assessment model that utilizes group decision-making methods to integrate all stakeholders’ attitudes. This study employs the PEEST (political, economic, environmental, social, and technological) framework to identify 27 barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology. Subsequently, an expertise-based group decision-making approach is used to quantify the prominence of various barriers according to various types of stakeholders. The results indicate that the five most intense barriers are storage constraints, insufficient economic incentives, high integration costs, a lack of functional appeal, and ambiguity regarding data disclosure and public data management regulations. This research makes novel theoretical and practical contributions, as it takes an empirical and all-encompassing approach to identifying obstacles to the adoption of blockchain technology and provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to reference in overcoming these obstacles.}
