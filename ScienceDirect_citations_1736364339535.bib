abstract = {The integration of marketing and R&D is a major concern for companies that want to improve their new product performance (NPP). For this integration, companies are using mechanisms such as physical proximity, cross-functional teams, and job rotation. This study examines the effectiveness of these mechanisms by developing a model that distinguishes between indirect effects of mechanisms on NPP (i.e., through a higher level of integration) and direct effects. The model is tested with data collected from 148 pharmaceutical companies. We were able to measure and compare the effectiveness of seven different integration mechanisms, which produced insights that are interesting and relevant for theory as well as practice. We found that housing marketing and R&D closer to each other and using an influential cross-functional phase review board are the most effective mechanisms to foster integration. Equal remuneration and career opportunities for marketing and R&D and cross-functional teams are somewhat less effective, whereas personnel movement and informal social group events contribute little. ICT appears to be a very effective tool for enhancing NPP. ICT not only fosters integration between marketing and R&D, but it also has an independent direct positive effect on NPP. Through ICT the day-to-day communication between the different parties in the companies becomes much easier, and we think that this fosters the knowledge creation process within marketing and R&D. For cross-functional phase review boards we found a negative direct effect on NPP. Notwithstanding its strong positive effect on integration, a price is paid in terms of NPP. This may be related to the amount of formalization and complexity accompanying this mechanism.}

abstract = {To address information vagueness and uncertainty of the order demand, the logistics service provider (LSP) service capacity and the target preference caused by emergency events, a multiobjective team optimization model is developed for the customer order decoupling point (CODP) decision, supplier selection and order quantity allocation problems in customized logistics service supply chain. Three important techniques are described: (1) Fuzzy objective coefficients due to the uncertainty of the order and objective weights. (2) Fuzzy constraint parameters due to LSP service capacity and order demand variations. (3) A fuzzy single objective weighting technique with acceptance coefficient of constraint and fuzzy parameters that reflects decision-maker preferences. The acceptance coefficients of the constraints are integrated into the single objective model, which reflects the satisfaction level of the logistics service integrator (LSI) for feasible solutions. Then, we perform fuzzy decision and feasible solution design based on the center of gravity method defuzzification and maximum membership degree principle. To optimize decisions for decision-makers, the effects of some important fuzzy objective coefficients and fuzzy constraint parameters on the CODP decision and the acceptance coefficient of constraint was explored through sensitivity analysis. Numerical experiments show that the scale effect coefficient and objective function threshold have greater effects on the CODP decision.}

However, further theoretical and empirical development is still much in need. Grounded in Information Processing Theory, we present a model that provides a new breakdown of the components of functional integration and explains how the interaction between them accelerates new product development (NPD). The model was tested on a sample of 141 Spanish firms using structural equation modeling (SEM). The study makes several contributions: It provides empirical evidence of the benefits of purchasing-marketing integration; it identifies its three components: shared information on purchasing, shared information on marketing, and the alignment of decisions, and it uncovers the complete mediation of aligned decisions on the effect shared information has on speed in NPD. Additionally, it contributes to solving the lack of consensus on the conceptualization of functional integration as reported by the literature.}

At first glance, this development is similar to the business process re-engineering (BPR) movement in the private sector. While policy makers and practitioners in the public sector have branded their recent improvements as BPR, the academic and research community have thus far eluded from making any comparisons. This has left a vacuum in terms of understanding the complexity of the challenges facing e-Government re-engineering and resultant change in public agencies. The aim of this paper is to translate the BPR movement findings to the field of e-Government induced change in the public sector. BPR characteristics and challenges are derived using normative literature and compared with two cases of public sector transformation in the UK and Netherlands. The results of these cases show that e-Government-induced change requires a plan for a radical improvement which, in contrast to BPR, is obtained by incremental steps and has a high level of participation. The findings offer policy makers valuable insights into the complexities and possible strategies that may need to be followed in order to succeed in e-Government implementation.}

This paper aims to investigate an SSOA problem under multiple items, multiple suppliers, multiple price levels, and multiple period using a robust-fuzzy multi-objective programming in which: (a) transportation cost, delay penalty cost, and demand are uncertain; (b) four objectives are proposed to minimize total costs and the number of defective items and to maximize environmental and social impacts; and (c) all objectives of the problem have a fuzzy membership degree that is determined by the decision-makers. A robust optimization approach is elaborated as a solution procedure to address the uncertainty of the decision variables. The significance of each objective in practice is discussed based on seven distinct scenarios that produce a specific membership degree to help practitioners make efficient decisions in selecting the suppliers and allocating the orders. Two numerical examples with different sizes are conducted to validate the mathematical model. Thereafter, the sensitivity of each scenario on objectives and total satisfaction degree is analyzed. The results of the numerical solution compare the value of four objective functions under each developed scenario to provide a trade-off insight between different objectives for practitioners. Eventually, the credibility and efficiency of the proposed solution procedure are evaluated to validate the findings.}

abstract = {Energy efficient technologies offered by the market increases productivity. However, decision making for these technologies is usually obstructed in the firms and comes up with organizational barriers. Compressor selection in petrochemical industry requires assessment of several criteria such as ‘reliability, energy consumption, initial investment, capacity, pressure, and maintenance cost.’ Therefore, air compressor selection is a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem. The aim of this study is to select the most eligible compressor(s) so as to avoid the high energy consumption due to the capacity and maintenance costs. It is also aimed to avoid failures due to the reliability problems and high pressure. MADM usually takes place in a vague and imprecise environment. Soft computing techniques such as fuzzy sets and system can be used for decision making where vague and imprecise knowledge is available. In this study, an integrated fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodologies are employed for the compressor selection. Fuzzy AHP was used to determine the weights of criteria and fuzzy TOPSIS was employed to order the scenarios according to their superiority. The total effect of all criteria was determined for all alternative scenarios to make an optimal decision. Moreover, the types of compressor, carbon emission, waste heat recovery and their capacities were analyzed and compared by statistical approaches. Six different scenarios were compared, scenario III was determined to be the best which has the highest closeness coefficient. In this scenario, the turbo compressors of active system reduces the total energy consumption due to low specific energy consumption (SEC) characteristics. Although the screw compressors have high maintenance costs, the heat recovery potential makes scenario III still preferable than the other 5 scenarios.}

A key part of manufacturers’ work with suppliers concerns improving the quality of their respective products, which gives rise to a collaborative activity usually termed as “supply quality management”. When the manufacturers are competitors, they do not wish to see a common supplier dividing his involvement in quality improvement unequally between themselves and their rivals. However, as the suppliers collaborate with several manufacturers, it is highly questionable whether their efforts will be strictly equivalent for each manufacturer. In this paper, a non-cooperative dynamic game is formulated in which a single supplier collaborates with two manufacturers on design quality improvements for their respective products. The manufacturers compete for market demand both on price and design quality. The paper analyzes how each party should allocate resources for quality improvement over time. In order to take into account the potential coordinating power of the compensation scheme adopted in this type of decentralized setting, we compare the possible outcomes under a wholesale price contract and a revenue-sharing contract.}

Product variety design means the challenge to simultaneously design multiple products for achieving higher optimality beyond ordinary design methods for a single product. When the possibilities of computational optimization for product variety design under fixed product architecture are explored, optimization is demanded to determine the contents of modules and their combinations under fixed modular architecture. This indicates that product variety optimization includes three classes of optimization problems: attribute assignment, module combination, and simultaneous design of both. Following problem classification, the domains and situations of such optimization problems are investigated. Then, two typical optimization examples are demonstrated through aircraft design for simultaneous optimal attribute assignment and through design of television receiver circuits for optimal module combination, respectively. The discussion concludes with the roles of problem classification and the direction of future works.}

For the first time, we investigate the prioritization of the alternatives for the development of PV solar power via the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), which show great power in capturing ambiguous, uncertain, and vague information, and mitigating information loss. This paper presents a novel integrated intelligent decision support system comprising of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) within an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) framework. Four alternatives are considered. To rank these alternatives, twelve criteria are defined under four aspects of SWOT analysis based on literature review and discussion with decision-makers. Subsequently, the IVIF-AHP method is utilized to determine the weights assigned to each criterion and sub-criterion. Finally, the IVIF-CoCoSo method is employed to rank four alternatives. The results showed that giving proactive attention to mitigating potential adverse environmental impacts of PV solar systems is the most highly prioritized strategy for PV solar power development. The results of the comparative and sensitivity analyses showed that the proposed method generates highly robust outcomes. The formulated integrated intelligent decision support system can help energy policy authorities with a valuable resource to craft optimal techniques for developing PV solar power.}

The configuration method is an efficient way for rapid PES customization to enhance customer satisfaction. However, the earlier service configuration approaches can produce a large number of feasible solutions, especially when there are more module instances, less constraints or fewer customers requirements. This will increase the burden of service solution screening and lower the efficiency of service delivery. To solve this problem, a multi-objective optimization model for configuration of the product-extension service is proposed. The optimization model simultaneously considers service performance, service cost and response time, and it is solved by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to obtain a set of optimal configuration solutions. Finally, an application of this service configuration optimization to elevator service demonstrates the potential of the method.}

The originality of the proposed method lies in the use of predictive models (multivariate regression), whose coefficients are used to weigh the contribution of each upstream characteristic to predict the final characteristics. In the context of continuous improvement environments, the application of different SPC approaches to manufacturing processes were compared. The results showed that the multivariate SPC method based on partial least squares regression was superior to traditional univariate and multivariate SPC methods in terms of the predictive precision to detect downstream faults in customer characteristics. However, the use of multiple linear regression may also be an option, since the identification of what upstream characteristic is causing the out-of-control signal is simpler than that of partial least squares regression, and predictive precision in the case of each of the two methods is comparable in practical terms.}

The effects and ranking of identified key structural-operation factors on the decommissioning planning process are numerically computed and discussed. The key system variables are developed with reference to established Asset Integrity Management Systems. Subject matter expert surveys are conducted on leading decommissioning and structural integrity experts in the region which are reflected in the decision matrices. A mathematical standardization technique is employed to remove inconsistencies in the intermediate decision vectors. The model is benchmarked against an actual decommissioning project in Malaysian waters which was based on conventional practices.

abstract = {The early phases of a product development project (i.e., concept generation and product planning) are commonly acknowledged to play a central role in the success of product innovation. Early decisions are unlikely to be changed during downstream phases, unless high costs and time are experienced. They have therefore the highest influence on project performance. However, early analysis and problem solving is also a difficult task, because the necessary information and insights are not available until one gets into detailed design. Most companies are locked in this dilemma between anticipation (i.e., anticipating decisions in the early phases of product development, where influence on performance is substantial) and reaction (i.e., delaying decisions to downstream phases, where information and opportunities are manifest). This article investigates early development practices in 18 Italian and Swedish companies, operating in the vehicle, helicopter, and white-goods industries. It shows that neither anticipation nor reaction may be considered a best practice in absolute terms. Rather, it identifies four possible approaches to manage the early phases (detailed, selective, comprehensive, and postponed), where anticipation and reaction have different balances. In addition, the article shows how anticipation and reaction are not contradictory or mutually exclusive, but strongly interact with each other through a mechanism that we call planned flexibility, i.e., the capability to build flexibility into the development process due to decisions taken early in the project.}

The stratum corneum, however, is a barrier for peptides; hence there is a need for agents to enhance peptide transport. The aim of this study was to investigate the enhancement properties of azacycloheptan-2-ones (Azones) as a function of hydrocarbon chain length. Their ability to enhance the percutaneous penetration of desglycinamide arginine vasopressin (DGAVP) was taken as a criterion. The flux of DGAVP through human stratum corneum was measured. For control experiments the stratum corneum was either untreated or immersed in propylene glycol (PG). The non-enhanced peptide flux through human stratum corneum was 1.6 ± 0.1 nmol/cm2 per h (peptide concentration in the donor 6.0 mM). Pretreatment with PG or hexyl- or octyl-Azone did not change the flux significantly. However, the permeability increased 1.9-fold after pretreatment with decyl-Azone 3.5-fold with dodecyl-Azone, and 2.5-fold with tetradecy]- Azone. Electron micrographs taken from freeze-fracture replicas of skin samples treated with either PG or dodecyl-Azone suggest that these treatments do not drastically change the lamellar appearance of the intercellular lipids. Taken together, the morphological and kinetical data suggest that the enhancing effect of Azone is caused by interference with the packing arrangement of the intercellular lamellar lipids in the stratum corneum, most likely by insertion of Azones into the lipid bilayers. In order to assess the capability of the Azone molecule to perturb the lipid arrangement within the bilayers, the degree of conformational freedom in Azone's polar head group was investigated using computer-aided molecular modelling. These calculations indicated that, upon turning the carbonyl moiety towards the interlamellar hydrophilic domain, a ‘soup-spoon’ conformation can be obtained, which is only 1 kcal/mol away from the minimum energy conformation. This ‘soup-spoon’ conformation would be highly favourable in order to accomodate the Azone molecule at the interface between the hydrocarbon and polar head group regions, respectively. This conformation might strongly perturb the lipid structure, making it more permeable to the penetrant. Such an effect apparently optimizes around a chain length of about 12 C-atoms.}

abstract = {With increasing attention on protecting the environment and social involvement, the concept of sustainable development has been widely mentioned in various industries. A new management mode, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), has come into being and has become a hot topic of discussion. As sustainable supplier selection is the most important issue in this mode, many multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods for sustainable supplier selection have been proposed, though sometimes it is more useful the sorting of suppliers into classes that show the performance of such suppliers. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of the sorting method, AHPSort II, under a fuzzy environment with interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and a new way of selecting representative points for inferring suppliers’ priorities that will improve the management of unclear class assignments by softening transitions between classes facilitating the sustainable supplier selection. A significant reduction of comparisons compared to the AHP method together a higher precision of inferred priorities is occurred. This novel IT2FS sorting MCDM makes decisions become more in line with reality because of a better management of uncertainty and more accurate priorities. Finally, an application of the previous method to the selection of a sustainable material supplier is provided to show how the proposed method worked.}

To describe host characteristics (use of highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]; CD4+ T-lymphocyte count; HIV ribonucleic acid [RNA] blood level) of people who were diagnosed with AIDS-related cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis after HAART became available and to investigate effects of HAART on ophthalmic findings.
Design
Retrospective, observational case series.
Methods
We collected demographic, medical, laboratory, and ophthalmic data for all patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed, untreated CMV retinitis from January 1997 through December 2000 at 10 sites in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California.
Results
The proportions of Hispanic and African-American patients were equivalent to or greater than their prevalences in the AIDS and general populations of Los Angeles County. Most patients (n = 80; 63.5%) were known to be receiving HAART at the time of CMV retinitis diagnosis; only 22 patients (17.5%) were HAART-naïve. Median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 15 cells/μl and median HIV RNA blood level was 103,000 copies/ml for all patients, but in 10 patients, CMV retinitis developed despite good immunologic and virologic responses to HAART. When compared with HAART-naïve patients, HAART-failure patients with CMV retinitis had more asymptomatic disease (P = .073), better visual acuity in the better eye (P = .003), more bilateral disease (P = .007), less zone 1 involvement (P = .042), and lower lesion border opacity scores (P = .054).
Conclusions
Most patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed CMV retinitis in an urban setting are HAART-experienced. HAART may influence characteristics of new CMV retinitis lesions at presentation, despite laboratory evidence of treatment failure, possibly because of residual CMV-specific immunity.}

It plays a significant role in customer acquisition and retention decisions. Given the growing importance of creating value for shareholders, market strategies have to be evaluated by their capacity to achieve this goal. Accordingly, both the acquisition and maintenance of customers must result in superior cash flows and augmented shareholder value. However, little attention has been paid to the link between customer lifetime value and shareholder value. The authors of this paper provide a conceptual framework for linking customer lifetime value to shareholder value. It is argued that customers have to be treated as assets that increase shareholder value by accelerating and enhancing cash flows, reducing cash flow volatility and vulnerability and increasing the residual value of the firm.}

The evaluation of alternative materials may be based on imprecise information or uncertain data. Furthermore, there can be significant dependence and feedbacks between the different criteria for material selection. However, most existing decision approaches cannot capture these complex interrelationships. In response, this paper proposes a general framework for evaluating and selecting the best material for a given application. A novel hybrid multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model combining DEMATEL-based ANP (DANP) and modified VIKOR is used to solve the material selection problems of multiple dimensions and criteria that are interdependent. Moreover, target-based criteria as well as cost and benefit criteria can be addressed simultaneously in the proposed model. Finally, an empirical case concerning the bush material selection for a split journal bearing is presented to illustrate the potential of the new model. The results show that the proposed method for material selection is effective and provides meaningful implications for designers and engineers to refer.}

The fraction is completely determined by A and C = [c1, c2, …, cf]; hence all optimality conditions are also completely determined by A and C. It has been shown before that for s a prime the information matrix for a parallel flats fraction can be characterized in terms of the direct sum of relatively small matrices over the cyclotomic field of order s over the rationals.

The usefulness of these results are in the construction of optimal fractions and the comparison of competing fractions.}

For this review we adopt a framework constructed on two dimensions of an assessment methodology, namely method used and scope. As for the method used, methodologies can be either quantitative, if they aim at simulating or evaluating the outcomes in terms of vehicle flows, pollutant emissions, or monetary outcomes, or qualitative, if they are directed towards elucidating the subjective assessment of stakeholders. Concerning the scope, existing methodologies can cover three main aspects of urban freight distribution systems, such as measures to be assessed, stakeholders and impact areas.}

abstract = {In recent years, many industrial firms have been able to use roadmapping as an effective process methodology for projecting future technology and for coordinating technology planning and strategy. Firms potentially realize a number of benefits in deploying technology roadmapping (TRM) processes. Roadmaps provide information identifying which new technologies will meet firms' future product demands, allowing companies to leverage R&D investments through choosing appropriately out of a range of alternative technologies. Moreover, the roadmapping process serves an important communication tool helping to bring about consensus among roadmap developers, as well as between participants brought in during the development process, who may communicate their understanding of shared corporate goals through the roadmap. However, there are few conceptual accounts or case studies have made the argument that roadmapping processes may be used effectively as communication tools. This paper, therefore, seeks to elaborate a theoretical foundation for identifying the factors that must be considered in setting up a roadmap and for analyzing the effect of these factors on technology roadmap credibility as perceived by its users. Based on the survey results of 120 different R&D units, this empirical study found that firms need to explore further how they can enable frequent interactions between the TRM development team and TRM participants. A high level of interaction will improve the credibility of a TRM, with communication channels selected by the organization also positively affecting TRM credibility.}

This has become even more apparent in recent years, for example following the rapid progress of electronics and informatics and their introduction into products that previously were mainly mechanical. When viewing the ability to sustain a successful flow of new technology into commercially successful products, several studies have pointed to the potential barriers between different stages as a key issue and a managerially troublesome one. In this study, the link between applied research and product development is analyzed using three main dimensions. First, the ability to strategically align the technology and the product strategy, and to operationally accelerate or otherwise redirect applied research tasks towards product development, leads to the dimension termed strategic and operational synchronization. The second dimension deals with the issue of a proper technology scope, answering the question of “what to transfer” (i.e. blueprints, alternative concepts, prototypes). The third dimension consists of the methods and procedures for managing transfer of new technology from applied research to product development, i.e. transfer management. These dimensions are used to examine opposing statements in prior research, where technology transfer is seen either as an event in time or merely as a continuous process. The predicted differences between applied researchers and product developers are also explored in order to identify potential gaps indicating issues of importance when managing internal technology transfer. The results strengthen the conception of technology transfer as a continuous process in order to be successful, indicate areas of importance for managing this process, and highlight the importance of starting a successful commercialization of new technologies already at the strategic planning level. For example, it was clear from the study that applied research tasks are often de-staffed and prolonged, and the primary reason for not being able to utilize their outcome is that the delivery is not timely. These findings imply an area for improvement—the resource management of applied research tasks aligned with the overall portfolio strategy. Further, a detailed context for applied research and product development is described and analyzed, potentially functioning as a benchmarking case for analyzing other companies’ ways of managing the link between applied research and product development.}

These different bonding patterns suggest some structural heterogeneity in the distribution of cysteine residues along the sturgeon Ig chains.

However, if individual factories independently buy and allocate redundancy components, huge investments will be required. To optimize the reliability level and costs of the supply chain network, the present study allocates these components to suppliers based on customer demand. While allocating redundancy components to factories improves the chain's reliability, it increases energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a balance between cost, reliability, and pollution needs to be established. The study considers a three-level supply chain, including the supplier (factories), distributor, and retailer, with stochastic and normally distributed demand assumed for each retailer. To address demand fluctuations, the risk pooling effect is implemented. As the problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, the study develops three multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII), Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA), and Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony (MOABC) to solve it. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using the results of the complete enumeration method. The comparison results based on six multi-objective performance metrics show that the MOABC algorithm has better performance in finding high-quality solutions in less time, while the NSGAII algorithm provides more diverse Pareto optimal solutions.}

Academics tend to investigate product development performance at the firm level, whereas managers currently measure, and indicate that they want to understand more completely, individual product success.}

abstract = {Many tools have been developed to support the Front End of Eco-Innovation (FEEI) to design more radical product/service concepts. Although it is widely recognised that designers need to extend the consideration of key stakeholders in the value chain, few studies analyse the impact of the integration of the 'stakeholder' notion into eco-innovation practices. This paper aims at understanding how the 'stakeholder' perspective can usefully be integrated into eco-innovation sessions. In addition to an extended literature review of existing eco-innovation tools with a stakeholder perspective, this paper adopts an original “research scenario” perspective through a collection of case studies, with various participants, cultural backgrounds, and industrial or academic contexts. Through a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) framework, the paper analyses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the integration of the stakeholder notion into eco-innovation tasks. This research highlights the different ways to consider stakeholders at the FEEI stage, from stakeholder identification to the analysis of the different types of stakeholder value. Moreover, the need to adapt the stakeholder approach according to the type of FEEI tool user is emphasised. Stakeholder typologies can be reduced to a few key unfamiliar stakeholders during the ideation process with industrialists, while the number of stakeholders can be more exhaustive in an educational approach.}

abstract = {Although management can gain great performance benefit from colocating cross-functional product development teams, colocation is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as companies globalize and form alliances. Consequently, this article offers guidance to keep your development team functioning effectively even though it may be dispersed across town or around the world. We aim our suggestions at the team leader, but both team members and managers will find helpful ideas and become sensitive to critical issues. For example, management often underestimates the loss in team performance as the team disperses and incorrectly assumes that communication technologies alone will largely overcome the complications of distance. An effective team depends on open, effective communication, which in turn depends on trust among members. Thus, trust is the foundation, but it is also the very quality that is most difficult to build at a distance. For this reason and for several others that occur in the very front of the project, we suggest that if you can get your team together face-to-face at any time during the project, do it at the beginning. You can establish trust while you are planning the project together, writing the product specification, formulating working approaches, and creating communication protocols (for example, how long before an e-mail must be answered?). Likewise, the most important maintenance activity during the middle of the project is retaining an effective level of trust, which is far easier than having to rebuild trust. In part, you accomplish this by “humanizing” the project: sharing team member biographical information, telling an occasional good-natured joke, and knowing when a colleague’s family member is in the hospital. We also cover communication technologies—which ones to select and why you need a variety of media. Although such technologies are necessary for running a dispersed team, they are not nearly as sufficient as many technology suppliers suggest. Another complication is that differences in culture tend to grow as the team spreads over greater distances, encountering different time zones, languages, ethnic groups, and thus corresponding values. Although such differences place challenges before the team, diversity also offers advantages to those who are sensitive to the facets of culture. Consequently, we break culture down into its components and suggest ways of working with each one. Although we tend to underestimate the complications of working at a distance today, in time, teams will learn the skills needed. In the meantime, the perceptive manager and team leader will pay special attention to building these skills.}

An optimal match between demanders and suppliers can facilitate continuous improvement and efficiency in knowledge services. While selecting suitable matching knowledge demander and supplier pairs is of significance for effective knowledge services, an area that has been generally neglected in previous studies. This paper reports on a method for effectively matching suitable knowledge service demanders and suppliers in which the expectation levels of attributes given by demanders and suppliers are considered. Linguistic information is used to describe the demanders and suppliers’ expectation levels and their actual levels. A new matching degree calculation method is proposed which takes account of the fuzzy linguistic information. First, the matching relationship between the demanders and suppliers is defined. Then, from the principle of axiomatic design (AD), a method based on fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) is developed to identify the matching degree between the knowledge demanders and suppliers. Further, a multi-objective optimization model is formulated to maximize the overall matching degree of the pairs and to select the optimal matching pairs. Finally, an example illustrates the potential applications of the proposed method. The obtained computational process and results clearly demonstrate how optimal matching pairs can be identified for knowledge services’ demanders and suppliers.}

Specifically, the DM’s grey-based preferences, unilateral movements (UMs), and grey unilateral improvement (GUI) are redefined by the matrix representation. Furthermore, for the multiple DMs graph model, the joint UMs and joint GUIs for a collection of more than two DMs also have been represented by the matrix expression. Then, the matrix representation approach is used to describe and determine the stability of the given state for a focus DM based on different grey-based stability definitions, as well as, that also means the DM has different behavioral patterns in conflict when the DM has grey-based preferences. In summary, the matrix representation approach is proposed to determine and analyze individual stability and equilibrium for both two DM and multiple DMs graph models based on the framework of different grey stability definitions. Finally, a real application to a generic sustainable development conflict and Elmira groundwater contamination conflict is illustrated to show the usefulness and correctness of the matrix representation of GMCR with grey-based preferences.}

abstract = {As a result of increased mobility patterns of workers, explaining labor flows and partitioning regions into local labor markets (LLMs) have become important economic issues. For the former, it is useful to understand jointly where individuals live and where they work. For the latter, such markets attempt to delineate regions with a high proportion of workers both living and working. To address these questions, we separate the problem into two stages. First, we introduce a stochastic modeling approach using a hierarchical spatial interaction specification at the individual level, incorporating individual-level covariates, origin (O) and destination (D) covariates, and spatial structure. We fit the model within a Bayesian framework. Such modeling enables posterior inference regarding the importance of these components as well as the O–D matrix of flows. Nested model comparison is available as well. For computational convenience, we start with a minimum market configuration (MMC) upon which our model is overlaid. At the second stage, after model fitting and inference, we turn to LLM creation. We introduce a utility with regard to the performance of an LLM partition and, with posterior samples, we can obtain the posterior distribution of the utility for any given LLM specification which we view as a partition of the MMC. We further provide an explicit algorithm to obtain good partitions according to this utility, employing these posterior distributions. However, the space of potential market partitions is huge and we discuss challenges regarding selection of the number of markets and comparison of partitions using this utility. Our approach is illustrated using a rich dataset for the region of Aragón in Spain. In particular, we analyze the full dataset and also a sample. Future data collection will arise as samples of the working population so assessing population level inference from the sample is useful.}

Teamwork is essential through seamless tool integration and better co-ordination of human activities. This paper proposes to use workflow management as a mechanism to facilitate the teamwork in a collaborative product development environment where remote Web-based Decision Support Systems (TeleDSS) are extensively used by team members who are geographically distributed. The workflow of a project is modelled as a network. Its nodes correspond to the work (packages), and its edges to flows of control and data. The concept of agents is introduced to define nodes and the concept of messages to define edges. As a sandwich layer, agents act as special-purpose application clients for the remote TeleDSS application servers. Agents are delegated to manipulate the corresponding TeleDSS on behalf of their human users. Details of the proceedings are recorded by agents as their properties for future references or shared uses by other team members. Through flow messages, agents are able to share input and output data and request for remote services. One of the major contributions is that agents, once defined, can be reused for different projects without any changes.}

In this research, we first proposed an automatic filtering model to predict the helpfulness of online reviews from the perspective of the product designer. The KANO method, which is based on the classical conjoint analysis model, is then innovatively applied to analyze online reviews to develop appropriate product improvement strategies.

This study proposes a novel requirement-driven and strategy-based model to achieve the quick response order placement and production configuration services through three phases, that is, (1) requirement-based service diagnosis, (2) design strategy generation, and (3) service system conceptualization and evaluation. Firstly, a statistical kano analysis method was proposed to mining customer requirements considering industry contexts. Then, TRIZ evolution trends were modified to design concepts for digital transformation based on key enterprise processes. Finally, a novel service development maturity model was constructed to evaluate the new digital system design. A comprehensive empirical case study of designing “Customized Product Order Fulfillment System” for the laptop production process is conducted to demonstrate this approach. The proposed novel requirement-driven and strategy-based model is expected to provide valuable insights for suggestions on technological trends and forecasting, future diverse and innovative applications in customized order fulfillment scenarios.}

In this paper, we propose a new risk priority model using interval 2-tuple hybrid weighted distance (ITHWD) measure to solve the problems and improve the performance of the traditional FMEA. The new model can not only handle the uncertainty and diversity of FMEA team members’ assessment information but also consider the subjective and objective weights of risk factors in the risk ranking process.

Our results suggest that time preferences evolve substantially during this period, with younger children displaying more impatience than older children. We also find a strong association with race: black children, relative to white or Hispanic children, are more impatient.

However, in the usage phase, the integration of high-end manufacturing equipment (HEME) and maintenance-repair-overhaul (MRO) services is still insufficient to ensure the long-term continuous availability for function implementation (named as function availability). Thus, in view of function information in function availability, this paper develops a function availability-based integrated product-service network model (IPSN) from the perspective of complex network. This model merges the obtained function action units, structure module units as well as service execution activities and reveals their implement-maintain-ensure mapping mechanism based on the modeling processes of function network, structure network, service network and interdependent network of networks. In this model, functions are regarded as the goals serviced, structures are deemed as the objects serviced and services are the corresponding execution processes. With this model, the function availability could be better ensured with the delivery of the linked more critical integrated services. In order to illustrate the detailed modeling process, a case for feeding function of numerical control honing machine 2MK2263 × 200 is studied. From the evaluation and comparison results, it could be seen that this model not only realizes the integration of products and services to ensure the concerned functions, but also provides a vital foundation for the identification of critical nodes and the effective service configuration for availability.}

Although scholars and managers have recognized that striking a balance between both strategies (co-opetition) plays a key role in the performance of innovation process, little empirical research shows evidence about this relation. In this paper, firstly, a review of theoretical perspectives of co-opetition is made, and then, we identify alternative strategic behaviors from the combination of competitive and cooperative attitudes.

abstract = {In this study, a two-stage integrated approach is proposed and implemented to explore user perceptions about kitchen faucet styles and to find optimal levels of design parameters related to product appearance. At the first stage, a group of representative users have been asked to judge 38 systematically selected different faucet designs by using a semantic differential (SD) scale for 11 image (kansei) words about their visual perceptions. Then the relations between overall preference and kansei word scores of users are investigated by Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLOGREG). The model obtained helps understand how customers describe highly preferred designs. It can also be used to confirm if a product design will be highly preferred. At the second stage, the relations between overall preference scores and design parameter levels related to the product appearance are modeled using again OLOGREG, and then the best design parameter levels for visual perceptions are found by maximizing the overall preference scores. The results are confirmed and discussed. They are also compared to those of a commonly used approach in the literature, Conjoint Analysis (CA). This comparison has showed that the OLOGREG approach is superior to traditional CA. Finally, it is discussed how the product style design optimization approach presented and demonstrated in this study for the case of some kitchen faucets can be used in general for other products. Relevance to industry: Developing a user-centered product is an important policy of an enterprise in today's highly competitive marketplace. To reach this objective, a systematic method is proposed by integrating several techniques. This method will be useful to any industry that designs and produces consumer products. These products more fit the consumer needs and the competitiveness of them are improved.}

abstract = {This paper presents a viewpoint of design as intrinsically requiring the integration of techniques from several fundamentally incompatible world-views: distinc ‘sciences’. This implies that there can be no single ‘design science’. The paper also casts doubt on whether a design science, if it did exist, would be useful in the sense of helping to produce better or quicker designs. This entails a short discussion of the distinction between ‘complete’, ‘closed’ and ‘adequate’ theories. The paper concludes with explicit recommendations to make future designs better and to improve the effectiveness of design processes by enabling design ‘shared memory’. These recommendations follow directly from the strong limits imposed by the proposition that there is no single science of design.}

abstract = {In recent years the literature has offered a number of models developed for the Make or Buy decision. Most of them, however, seem to be of limited use to organisations because many Make or Buy decisions are mainly taken on the basis of cost considerations. In this study, two factors are believed to be important with respect to this limited usability of the current models. The first factor is content: these models lack some necessary concepts and are inadequate for strategic purposes. The second and perhaps more important factor is the process: these models do not pay enough attention to the complexity of the outsourcing decision-making process and are mainly descriptive in nature. In this article, the essential elements of the current models will be integrated into a new model with prescriptive features. The Analytic Hierarchy Process will be introduced as a suitable and helpful approach to the complexity of the outsourcing decision-making process. This study presents a decision-making model that provides support to managers confronted with the choice of whether to maintain production internally, or at least parts of it, or to outsource. The model is illustrated by its application in a shipyard in the Netherlands.}

At present, it is considered hard to teach by most faculty members, partly because there exist only limited teaching materials, particularly those that can be used for independent student design projects. To fill this gap, this paper presents a multidisciplinary, hierarchical procedure that guides students to design a chemical product – molecular, formulated, functional, and device in a systematic manner. It begins with a market study to gather market information, compare competing products, and identify the qualitative product attributes for satisfying consumer preferences. Then, these product attributes are converted to quantitative technical parameters through heuristics, mathematical models, experiments, tools, and databases. Next, a suitable manufacturing process is synthesized to produce the product with the required product specifications, followed by a financial analysis to evaluate product profitability. All of these concepts in the procedure are reinforced in a product design project. In conducting a design project, the students are encouraged to synthesize a novel product and to consult with other professionals such as business personnel, chemists, and material scientists to appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of product design. Two case studies are given in this paper to illustrate the learning process of, as well as the contents for, such a student project.}

Based on a literature review, a creative idea generation process was developed; it consists of four successive phases (Future envision, Opportunity identification and analysis, Idea generation, and Idea expansion) and one supportive phase (Ideation control). From various research fields, 70 idea generation techniques were collected and classified into phases of the process. To identify implicit and latent opportunities, the future envision method was developed based on a factor combination approach. In assessments by four experts in IT, the ideas generated by the UX-driven idea generation methodology got higher scores than brainstorming approach in novelty and relevance, but not in feasibility. The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction was greater in the group who used the UX-driven idea generation methodology. Relevance to industry: The idea generation methodology suggested in this study can help indusial designers such as novice designers, analytical individuals as well as intuitive individuals who adhere to initial ideas. The UX-driven methodology can be used as a guideline when selecting an idea generation technique in the FFE.}

The uniqueness of this study comes from using PCA as a scoring tool which is benchmarked against another scoring tool (PSI); however, both PSI and PCA avoid the bias that typically arises from assigning weights to different design attributes, as it is not necessary to assign a relative importance scheme between candidate materials. In this study, however, the authors detail the potential of this objective selection scheme to balance the technological, economical, societal and ecological constraints in the design of automobile bodies.}

abstract = {Amid the trend of surging demand, e-bike sharing provides substantial convenience for travel but also causes a large number of abandoned bicycles, parking issues, and other problems, which create significant challenges to recycling management. In this regard, a Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making method is developed to determine the selection of recycling suppliers. First, the concept of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy preference relation (IVPFPR) is defined, and the most optimistic and pessimistic acceptably consistent PFPRs are extracted for a given IVPFPR. Subsequently, an acceptably consistent PFPR that integrates the attitude characteristics is derived, and the priority weight vector is computed by constructing an optimization model. Second, a subjective and objective weight method of experts considering trust degree is constructed, and the weighted quadratic operator is defined to aggregate IVPFPRs. The linguistic weights of attributes are quantified and standardized by operator and score function. Third, a decision-making method is proposed and applied to a sustainable e-bike sharing recycling supplier selection example to show the feasibility of the method. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows that a relatively strict threshold can be set to improve the consensus of experts in order to obtain more reliable results when managers lack the knowledge of experts. In addition, in the process of recycling, managers need to urge and cooperate with suppliers to improve their performance in pollution and emission, green image, and recovery capacity.}

Besides, this study aims to determine which energy efficiency measures are preferred more according to the criteria that shipowners consider when they select energy efficiency measures. The questionnaire surveys were conducted face-to-face with twenty-three participants who were senior managers and/or inspectors of shipowner companies in Turkey, and each participant represents one company. The importance levels of the criteria that affect the decision-making process were determined by using the Fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method based on obtained quantitative data. The performance values of energy efficiency measures were determined by using the fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method. According to the findings, the most important criterion was “Practicality Level of Planning, Procurement and Installation Process”. The energy efficiency measure with the highest performance value was “Hull Cleaning”. It was seen that the most preferred energy efficiency measures were operational measures instead of retrofit and technical measures.}

The IRN approach enables decision making using only the internal knowledge incorporated in the data provided by the decision maker. A hybrid multi-criteria model was developed based on IRN, and demonstrated using the example of the bidder selection process in the state administration public procurement procedure. The first segment of the hybrid model deals with the rough interval DEMATEL-ANP (IR'DANP) model, which enables more objective expert evaluation of criteria in a subjective environment than the traditional/crisp approach. In the second segment, the evaluation is enabled by applying the new rough interval MAIRCA method, which introduces mathematical tools and shows high stability concerning changes in the nature and characteristics of the criteria. The results of the hybrid IR'DANP-MAIRCA model were analyzed using 36 scenarios of sensitivity analysis, which showed high stability of the results. The results of the interval rough method were compared with the fuzzy extensions of the TOPSIS, VIKOR, MABAC, TODIM, ELECTRE I and DEMATEL-ANP models.}

Linguistic variables represented by triangular fuzzy numbers are used to reflect decision maker preferences for the criteria importance weights and the performance ratings. After the individual preferences are aggregated or after the separation values are computed, they are then defuzzified.

Consequently, how to evaluate the quality of domain software has become an area that deserves more research. The existing research pays much attention to software for specific purposes and fields, or to specific stage of the software, which is not enough. Objective: This paper proposes a systematic quality evaluation method, which fully considers the generality, domain features, and application environment of domain software, and also supports subsequent analysis. Method: The quality evaluation method proposed in this paper defines all aspects of the domain software to be inspected by establishing an attribute model, obtains basic data on evaluation by analyzing and measuring evidence, tailor-makes the computing logic of quality evaluation score by establishing an evaluation model, and classifies domain software quality by establishing level model. This research verifies the applicability of evaluation by applying this method to management information system (MIS) in the field of a power plant. Results: The case example not only indicates that the proposed method can be applied to the quality evaluation and analysis of the power plant's MIS, but also its ease of usability. Conclusion: The method is applicable and can be easily used for the quality evaluation and analysis of the MIS in a power plant. Based on mechanisms, such as model customization and weight determination, this method also supports the quality evaluation and analysis of software applied in different fields. In the future, there will be a need to improve the objectivity and automation degree of the evaluation, and to apply and verify the method according to the different types of software in various fields.}

By imitating and simulating human decision-making behavioural patterns, the developed MCDM method selects the best alternative that is closer to what the DM desires. Furthermore, a novel subjective MCDM weighting methods called win-loss-draw (WLD) method is also developed, which is also based on human behavioural pattern. A real case study of domestic cheese brands is considered to apply the developed methods to select the best cheese supplier for an Iranian hypermarket. Compared to other MCDM methods, outputs of the RBOP method show some differences due to the impact of WLD method, which intensified divergence and optimal points during the decision-making process.}

In the context of eco-design, producers must need a much bigger framework than is available in current eco-design techniques. This calls for establishing a new discipline. This paper aims at proposing a novel engineering discipline for producers toward sustainable production and consumption, Service Engineering (SE). For the sake of this, the scheme of SE is first explained. Second, a methodology of modeling and designing services, and a computer-aided design tool called Service Explorer, are presented. Third, they are proved to be effective through two applications. In SE, positive and negative changes of consumers are modelled as value and cost, respectively. In addition, the model to describe a target consumer is provided for grounding the identified value. A design methodology including the identification of value with realization structures is also provided. Furthermore, SE allows designing services in parallel with products. In the application to service redesign of an existing hotel in Italy, it was demonstrated that the presented methods and tools facilitate designers adding new value like the view of outside through a window in energy-saving structure. It was also proven to deal with both products and services through generating a solution called “cash-back per non-wash” system for washing towels. The other smaller-scaled application to design of renting home appliances revealed that they support to determine a property of an adopted physical product like the size of a TV set depending on target customers’ properties effectively.}

abstract = {The main goal of green supply chain management is to minimize the injurious ecological impacts in all activities and phases of a supply chain. Evaluating the suppliers and selecting the best one based on environmental criteria can facilitate us to reach the objective of green supply chain management. As the assessment generally consists of various alternatives over different criteria, green supplier selection is regarded as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Hesitant fuzzy set, which is an extension of fuzzy set, is an effective tool to handle the vagueness in such a way that hesitant and flawed information by allowing the degree of belongingness for a green supplier selection over the evaluation criteria. In this paper, an integrated method is developed based on Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) approach to solve the multi-criteria decision-making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. This method is based on hesitant fuzzy operators, some improvement in the conventional WASPAS approach and a procedure for calculating the criteria weights. To calculate the criteria and decision expert weights, we propose new information measures for hesitant fuzzy sets and combine entropy and divergence measures for criteria weights, while we use similarity measure for decision expert weights. Since the uncertainty is an inevitable feature of multi-criteria decision-making problems, the developed approach can be a useful tool for uncertain multi-criteria decision-making atmosphere. Next, a green supplier selection problem is taken to show the usefulness of the developed approach in real-life decision-making problems. The results of this study found that the most significant criteria for green supplier selection were management commitment (0.3119), environmental management system (0.2259) and green product (0.2010). Also, we demonstrate a sensitivity analysis over different parameter values and sets of criteria weight to illustrate the stability of the developed method. Finally, the outcome developed approach with existing approaches is compared to validate the developed method.}

Approximately 100 mm of simulated rainfall with an intensity of 50 mmh−1 was applied to 12 experimental field plots. Two fertilizer application methods, surface application and subsurface application, were investigated for no-till and conventional tillage systems. The no-till system was found to be very effective in reducing runoff and sediment losses. No-till reduced sediment loss and total runo volume by 91–95% and 48–54%, respectively. Observed N yield was highest when fertilizer was surface applied in conventional tillage, and lowest when the fertilizer was incorporated in the no-till system. The effectiveness of no-till for N yield reduction ranged from 50% for NO3-N to 96% for TNsed compared with conventional tillage. Nitrogen yield in runoff from no-till plots was comparable to that from control plots (no fertilizer application) and significantly lower than that from conventional tillage plots. From the results of this study, it was concluded that compared with surface application, subsurface application of fertilizer is very effective for N yield reduction in runoff and is therefore recommended as an effective measure of controlling the nonpoint source pollution of surface waters.}

Pennsylvania adopted “impact fees” in 2012, which have raised more than $400 million for use by county and municipal governments that host UGD. We designed a public opinion survey (N=453) that oversamples residents in UGD counties in Pennsylvania to test whether residents in counties and municipalities that received impact fees are more supportive of a hypothetical UGD project than residents in counties and municipalities that received less or no impact fee revenue. We found that impact fee revenue is positively associated with support for the UGD project. Further, the level of government receiving the funds (county versus municipality) is related to public support for UGD: impact fee revenue disbursed to municipal governments is associated with a higher rate of public support than comparable amounts disbursed to county governments, conditional on the respondent being aware of fracking prior to the survey. Our findings are consistent with the literature on public trust in local government and have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD in the United States and internationally.}

These driverless technologies will create an unprecedented revolution in how people move, and policymakers will need appropriate tools to plan for and analyze the large impacts of novel navigation systems. In this paper we derive semiparametric estimates of the willingness to pay for automation. We use data from a nationwide online panel of 1260 individuals who answered a vehicle-purchase discrete choice experiment focused on energy efficiency and autonomous features. Several models were estimated with the choice microdata, including a conditional logit with deterministic consumer heterogeneity, a parametric random parameter logit, and a semiparametric random parameter logit. We draw three key results from our analysis. First, we find that the average household is willing to pay a significant amount for automation: about $3500 for partial automation and $4900 for full automation. Second, we estimate substantial heterogeneity in preferences for automation, where a significant share of the sample is willing to pay above $10,000 for full automation technology while many are not willing to pay any positive amount for the technology. Third, our semiparametric random parameter logit estimates suggest that the demand for automation is split approximately evenly between high, modest and no demand, highlighting the importance of modeling flexible preferences for emerging vehicle technology.}

When consumer uncertainty is high, restaurants that offer coupons have an average price that is about 60 percent higher than similar restaurants that do not issue coupons. When uncertainty is low, restaurants that offer coupons have an average price that is about 10 percent higher. These findings are consistent with online couponing in the restaurant industry being used for price discrimination and as a promotional device in the presence of higher uncertainty in consumer valuations.}

Additionally, in today's continuous-change business environment, managers are focused on reducing cycle time in nearly all operations, including NPD, in order to realize acceptable returns on investments more quickly. Thus, we must not only be better but also faster at NPD, specifically at compressing the cycle time between new product successes, i.e., accelerating success-to-success velocity and not just accelerating each NPD project. But, how can businesses both improve the probability of new product successes and also speed up the process of doing so? This paper proposes that formalizing front-end processes will certainly help. Specifically, a process is presented which draws on customer value research that ought to help clarify the traditional “fuzzy front end” of NPD processes, resulting in consistently more successful new products.}

Among these, a particular focus is placed on the influence of the CO2 emission reduction targets in both regions and their consequences on the carbon price in 2020. We estimate the resource allocation effects of EU climate change policies on both regions by taking into account the likely labor movement from Turkey to the EU and capital movement in the reverse direction. The results show that different emission targets for the two regions bring about a change in comparative advantages and thus a change in interregional competitiveness.}

VEs can approach each industrial project with tailored manufacturing systems represented by a temporary integration of processes capabilities and resources capacities from multiple enterprises in order to meet or exceed the quality-, time- and cost- frame requirements of the customer.

First, we explore the relationship between design and creativity - a popular concept and an important requirement in engineering design process. A search is conducted across repositories. This includes search in Google, Google Scholar and Google Books databases in addition to others. Findings show that the extent to which the design process requires creativity is somewhat obscure and not generally perceptible. We observe that creativity consists of two aspects: problem-solving and problem-exploring. We also observe that creativity drives the design process, not by the way of problem-solving but by the way of problem-exploring. However, currently, focus is on problem-solving than the equally important problem-exploring. For every 135 studies on problem-solving, there is only one on problem-exploring. Study on problem-exploring is limited. We research further and identify some determinants of the neglect in problem-exploring in design. These determinants are lack of motivation, significant level of difficulty and the presence of many problems yet unsolved. Using the X-Design Process model and Problem-dependent Solution model we show the importance and benefits of problem-exploring in design and why it deserves attention. Consequently, we illustrate the use of emergent technologies to support problem-exploring in design and give reasons why this is possible in Industry 4.0. These technologies include data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, duplication recognition, and so on. We indicate that these technologies will only play subordinate role to humans towards inspiring problem-exploring in design. Also, we state that a precondition to applying these technologies is a study of the human problem-exploring cognition process for subsequent simulation. Success in computational problem-exploring would lead to breakthroughs in global problem-exploring and trigger more creative solutions in coming years.}

abstract = {The continuing trend towards sourcing components and semi-finished goods for less vertically integrated manufacturing systems globally leads to a dramatic increase in supply options for companies. To ensure that companies benefit from the potentials global sourcing offers, supplier-buyer relationships need to be managed efficiently. Due to the decreasing share of value-adding activities provided in-house, suppliers are more and more considered as an essential contributor to the buying company's competitive position. Consequently, to realize and sustain competitive advantages, companies try to establish institutionalized long-term relationships to their most important suppliers and to actively improve the productivity and performance of their supplier base. To support supplier development in practice, researchers have developed decision support models that provide assistance in selecting and implementing suitable supplier development activities. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of decision support models for supplier development and to develop a research agenda that helps to identify promising areas for future research in this area. First, typical applications for supplier development as well as potential development measures that can be adopted to improve the performance of suppliers are identified. Secondly, a systematic literature review with a focus on decision support models for supplier development is conducted. Based on the analysis of the literature, we define a research agenda that synthesizes key trends and promising research opportunities and thus highlight areas where more decision support models are needed to foster supplier development initiatives in practice.}

abstract = {The problem of optimal team formation is domestic to many areas of work organization including education, sport, and business. It is beyond manual implementation to build near optimal teams as soon as the pool of available personnel grows into several tens. The selection process itself is usually well defined — for each team we construct the criteria relating to the required properties (i.e., capabilities) of the team members. Because these properties can be arbitrarily combined in the personnel, the objective function becomes self-conflicting. This aggravates the team formation and calls for a specialized software support. In the paper we present a new fuzzy-genetic analytical model for the problem of project team formation. It builds on previous quantitive approaches, but adds several modeling enhancements like derivation of personnel attributes from dynamic quantitive data, complex attribute modeling, and handling of necessary overcompetency. We improve the flexibility of requirements specification using a special format that expresses the required team capabilities using fuzzy descriptors. We then define a single compound objective function, which incorporates multiple opposing criteria that the solution should maximize. To optimize the selection of multiple project teams with possibly conflicting requirements, we propose a special adaptation of island genetic algorithm with mixed crossover where the fitness of common solution is used to drive the selection within the islands. We test the effectiveness of the system using artificial domains of different complexity and describe some practical experiences of using the system in the educational process.}

This study examines uncertainty from a total cost perspective, with regards to causes of supplier performance and capability on buyer’s organization. The proposed approach is assessed and tested in automotive industry for tier-1 supplier for selecting its own suppliers. To efficiently facilitate expert opinions, we form factors to represent and explain various supplier selection criteria and to reduce complexity. The case study in automotive industry shows several advantages of the proposed method. A BN approach facilitates a more insightful evaluation and selection of alternatives given its semantics for decision making.

abstract = {This paper presents an exploratory investigation of the manufacturing/marketing (hereafter M/M) interface. Drawing on the literature and prior empirical work in M/M strategies, we propose a path model for assessing the mediating impact of the M/M interface harmony—the functions’ ability to work together—on M/M morale and business performance. Using two convenience samples of executives, we empirically test the direct and indirect influence of predisposing factors (antecedents) and performance outcomes (consequences) that are expected theoretically to influence or be influenced by M/M interface harmony. We find that 11 of the 13 hypothesized direct effects are significant at the 0.012 level or below; and attesting to the mediating influence of the M/M ability to work together, 11 of the 12 indirect effects were significant at the 0.02 level or below. Increasing the emphasis on the importance of marketing or manufacturing, or both, improves the ability of both functions to work harmoniously, which in turn impacts M/M morale. Interfunctional harmony appears to have a stronger influence on each function’s morale than the importance attached to that function, ceteris paribus. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study provides insight on the distinctive roles whereby marketing and manufacturing functions influence performance. Marketing acts to improve competitive position and profitability through the mediating influence of M/M interface harmony and improved marketing morale. However, manufacturing morale was not shown to be a significant factor impacting performance. Rather, emphasis on manufacturing impacts competitive position directly, as indicated by the resource-based view of manufacturing strategy. This exploratory study provides new empirical evidence that the M/M interface harmony, as expressed by the functions’ ability to work together, matters significantly to business outcomes directly and indirectly.}

Scant research exists on the three pillars of sustainability ― economy, environment, and society ― in production frameworks through the lens of process improvement tools such as lean and six-sigma. Based on lean six-sigma, this paper develops a sustainable lean production framework (SLPF) for manufacturing companies supported by the theory of practice-based view. Since a high portion of production frameworks failed to reach the sustainability goals in the implementation, we use practitioners’ and scholars’ perspectives to build a framework including five stages and fifteen steps. To validate the framework, we empirically apply practitioners’ opinions using the Delphi method. Moreover, we experimentally verify the framework by implementing it in a cookware manufacturing company. The result showed that the proposed framework can significantly improve sustainability pillars, e.g., after an investment of $10,212, our case implementation was improved in the economy by $120,142 saving per year, the environment by reducing 257.14 tonnes CO2 per year and the society by minimizing 48 safety incidents per year, and 24 worker-absence per year.}

abstract = {Due to increases in world population, rapid urbanization, increasing environmental pollution, and poorly managed food supply chains (FSCs), supplying clean and reliable agri-food has become more critical. Furthermore, increasing concerns of the urban population on healthy and balanced nutrition have increased their demand for fresh foods (FFs). Also, the retail industry has become the leading sector responding to almost all requirements of individuals, including FFs. Heightened awareness of individuals on health, reliability, and quality forces retail chains to provide more qualified, sustainable, and reliable FFs for their customers. Retail chains try to construct and manage well-structured global fresh food supply chains (FFSCs) to respond to customers' needs satisfactorily. Thus, selecting logistics service providers performing FF logistics operations (i.e., cold transportation, warehousing, and other logistics activities) from farms to retailers is essential for reliable and sustainable FFSCs. Because FFSCs are pretty sensitive, and minor mistakes or delinquency may cause severe costs. Global retail chains, in particular, only focus on meeting short-term demand and not on a sustainable fresh food supplier selection; fresh food suppliers are essential to determine sustainability performance. In this context, a more holistic approach is needed, focusing not only on the global retail chain level's direct impacts but also on the positive impacts at the overall system level. While this study fills a gap, it also assesses the long-term and lasting impact of choosing a fresh food supplier. In addition, the impacts of logistics service providers on FFSCs' overall performance have not been addressed adequately in the relevant literature. This work aims to analyze the factors identified by the extended form of the Delphi method developed in the present article, influencing the selection of logistics service providers producing logistics services for fresh fruits and vegetables with the BN-VIKOR procedure. The paper's main significant finding is that the logistics firms' service capacity is the determinative and most influential factor. The current study provides insights and beneficial road maps to the practitioners and decision-makers in retailing industry to structure FFSCs. The results contribute to the literature on criteria for selecting sustainable fresh food suppliers in global retail chains and identify strategies and improvement opportunities that can lead to improvement in practice.}

abstract = {Due to an increased pressure to be environmentally sustainable, many manufacturing organizations, especially from developing countries like Bangladesh, are attempting to make necessary changes in practices and supply chains. However, those attempts need to be applied strategically with the objective to be both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. This paper offers a decision-making methodology by integrating a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating strategies for environmental sustainability based on their impact on the overall supply chain network of an organization. This paper first identifies 18 generic strategies for environmental sustainability and three supply chain performance measurement (PM) factors. Afterwards, the cause-effect relationships among these strategies and PM factors are utilized to capture the complicated relationships by FCM. The extended delta rule (EDR) learning algorithm was used in association with FCM to quantify the impact of those strategies on supply chain PM factors. Finally, DEA is used to prioritize strategies using these impact values. A real-life case using a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturer from Bangladesh is presented to justify the applicability of the proposed methodology. The results reflect the usefulness of this methodology for evaluating strategies for environmental sustainability in a supply chain (SC), specifically in the FMCG sector of an emerging economy. Thus, other manufacturing organizations from any industry can use this methodology to evaluate strategies for environmental sustainability.}

abstract = {The continuing trend towards sourcing components and semi-finished goods for less vertically integrated manufacturing systems globally leads to a dramatic increase in supply options for companies. To ensure that companies benefit from the potentials global sourcing offers, supplier-buyer relationships need to be managed efficiently. Due to the decreasing share of value-adding activities provided in-house, suppliers are more and more considered as an essential contributor to the buying company's competitive position. Consequently, to realize and sustain competitive advantages, companies try to establish institutionalized long-term relationships to their most important suppliers and to actively improve the productivity and performance of their supplier base. To support supplier development in practice, researchers have developed decision support models that provide assistance in selecting and implementing suitable supplier development activities. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of decision support models for supplier development and to develop a research agenda that helps to identify promising areas for future research in this area. First, typical applications for supplier development as well as potential development measures that can be adopted to improve the performance of suppliers are identified. Secondly, a systematic literature review with a focus on decision support models for supplier development is conducted. Based on the analysis of the literature, we define a research agenda that synthesizes key trends and promising research opportunities and thus highlight areas where more decision support models are needed to foster supplier development initiatives in practice.}

Specifically, a theoretical model is developed that hypothesizes that formal processes for market information acquisition and utilization have direct and positive main effects on new venture success and is then tested using a sample of 222 new ventures located in China. Findings indicate that new venture success is positively correlated with the use of formal processes for market information acquisition and use. Moreover, the relative importance of formal processes to the acquisition and use of market information depends on whether the new venture serves an emerging or established market. In particular, the impact of formal processes for information acquisition is higher among new ventures that serve emerging markets. In contrast, the impact of formal processes for information use is higher among new ventures that serve established markets. We present managerial implications of our results. For example, a new venture with a strong market orientation can respond quickly to emerging marketplace needs, and can even seize the advantage from incumbents. If it is in an emerging market, however, the new venture management team should strive to excel at information acquisition; in an established market, it is important for the management team to excel at information utilization.}

Such large vesicles are better suited for studies of protein rotation in reconstituted membranes than vesicles prepared by use of bile salts. At present the octylglucoside reconstituted monooxygenase system seems to be the most appropriate model for studying protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in liver microsomes due to the similarity with respect to the main structural and functional properties, including size.}

Generation of complex shapes in such materials by the traditional machining processes is experienced to be difficult. For effective utilization of the capabilities of different NTM processes, careful selection of the most suitable process for a given machining application is often required. Selection of the best suited NTM process for a work material and shape feature combination requires the consideration of several criteria. In this paper, an analytic network process (ANP)-based approach is proposed to select the most appropriate NTM process for a given machining application taking into account the interdependency and feedback relationships among various criteria affecting the NTM process selection decision. To avoid the difficult and time consuming mathematical calculations of the ANP, a computer program is also developed in Visual Basic 6.0 with graphical user interface to automate the entire NTM selection decision process. It simply acts as an ANP solver. The observed results from the ANP solver are quite satisfactory and match well with those obtained by the past researchers.}

To accomplish this, it addressed three aspects of the task of measurement. First, it surveys several distinct literatures to establish precedence for defining a spacecraft innovation metric. Second, the conceptual trade-offs associated with adopting this principle in the context of communication satellites are elucidated and treated. By defining product boundaries along the dimensions of product scope and market transactions, three paradigms for measurement are proposed; namely: (1) the communication satellite enterprise; (2) the physical satellite; and (3) communication service. Third, under the constraints of historical data collection realities, next-best estimators are put forward as proxies for the parameters required to implement the proposed metrics. Based on these proxies, the relative merits of each measurement paradigm are illustrated through an analysis of the innovation history of communication satellites.}

TODness is a principle that evaluates the extent to which sites meet Traffic-Oriented Development (TOD). To an extent, it reflects some criteria for sustainable transportation development. Based on the TODness, this paper develops a comprehensive index called “Sustainable TODness” around the four dimensions of sustainable development—environmental, economic, social, and transportation efficiency—combined with the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process. Using this index, an evaluation of 13 TOD stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area was carried out, and the impedance pedestrian catchment area of ​​each station was spatially analyzed in conjunction with the geographic information system to generate a heat map of indicators’ distribution. According to the spatial characteristics reflected by the heat map, the stations are divided into three categories. We found that some popular TOD stations have high scores on the economic level, but have more or fewer deficiencies in the other three dimensions. We believe that the research method in this article is applicable to the sustainability evaluation of any TOD site in the world and provides new ideas for the renewal of developed urban areas and new land use in the future.}
