In the last decade, arsenic contamination in water resources from natural and anthropogenic sources has become an important issue in Turkey. In particular, high arsenic levels have been detected in the groundwater of many small towns and villages in the Aegean Region and Central Anatolia. The implementation of appropriate treatment systems is essential to reduce the arsenic concentrations to acceptable levels. The ideal technology for rural areas should be effective in producing arsenic- free water but should also be low cost, have low energy demand and require little maintenance. Although technical and economic parameters play important roles in the selection of technology, it should also be environmentally friendly. As there are several important factors affecting decisions about treatment systems, in this study the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to solve the problem and determine the preferences. In the study, “chemical treatment”, “adsorption”, and “reverse osmosis” were chosen as alternatives. Treatment alternatives were evaluated considering technical, economic and environmental criteria. The results of the AHP analysis show that the operational features and treatment performance were the major influencing factors for rural settlements in decision-making. According to AHP, the best alternative was adsorption. The ranking order of the alternatives for rural settlements was adsorption > reverse osmosis > chemical treatment.}

They offer many advantages, such as saving resources and reducing negative environmental impacts. However, few studies have assessed their incremental costs and social benefits. This study comprehensively analyzed the incremental costs and benefits of green buildings in China through the life cycle stages of preparation, design, construction, and operation-management. The Analytic Hierarchy Process and Matter Element Analysis were jointly applied to establish a comprehensive green-building cost-benefit evaluation system. Based on expert judgment, an embracive two-level index scheme and a three-step grading strategy were developed. A residential case study tested the applicability of the model. It yielded the largest share of incremental cost in the construction phase at 90.5%. The economic benefits accounted for the largest proportion of incremental benefits at 72.22%, meeting the green building criteria and achieving the highest 3-star rating. The study has developed a full life-cycle costing methodology for green building design and quantified the benefits at each stage. The findings offer the theoretical and practical basis to refine the assessment of green building projects and improve green building performance to meet sustainable development goals.}

Determining how to improve the service level and customer satisfaction are the keys to a successful bicycle sharing business in today’s fiercely competitive market and are also the keys to achieving a sustainable operation. In this paper, following a hierarchical structure, five main factors related to the bicycle sharing operations are identified: (1) convenience and flexibility, (2) operation service, (3) economic cost, (4) design and layout and (5) management specification. Eighteen sub factors are then derived. To determine the significant factors affecting bicycle sharing operations, the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach based on Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) are proposed. First, IT2FSs and fuzzy DEMATEL are integrated to analyze the complex relationships among the various factors. DEMATEL is then integrated with ANP to rank the importance of these factors. Results are compared with those of other state-of-the-art MCDM methods. It is concluded that convenience and flexibility, rationality of the layout, and economic cost are the three most important factors impacting the bicycle sharing business model. Based on the findings, theoretical guidance for the development of bicycle sharing operations is provided.}

A strategy map is a visual representation of the strategic objectives and the causal relationships between them in an organization. This work uses this map to align strategic projects to the objectives of the shareholders. Even though there are a large number of articles on the selection/ranking of projects, we found that the literature on the selection/ranking from a strategic perspective is scarce. According to our review, the existing literature does not include any work in which the impact of projects on strategic objectives is established. The work presented here fills this gap. The multicriteria decision-making method DEMATEL is used to rank strategic projects. The method creates a network that includes strategic objectives and projects as nodes and the causal relationships between them. Two types of links between the nodes are included in the model: those representing the direct causal relationships between strategic objectives (strategy map) and those representing the influence of the strategic projects on the strategic objectives. DEMATEL is applied to find the total influence (direct and indirect) of the strategic projects on the strategic objectives of the Financial Perspective of the BSC, which represents the view of the shareholders. The method is illustrated using the case of a real manufacturing company that produces moldings and wall coatings. The managers who participated in the process found it very useful, and the results are being used as a guide for the implementation of strategic projects. The proposed method allows the evaluation of projects in relation to their support to the mission of the organization.}

The problem underlying the right selection of new generations of technologies is, from a methodological perspective, linked to key heterogeneous (technological, economic, human, and organizational) factors. Even though previous research has focused on the selection of technologies within the industrial sector, there is little research on the selection of technology at R&D Institutions and, in particular, at R&D Centers. In this research, a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based evaluation model for decision-making (MIVES), adaptable to one or several technologies, is therefore, employed. In such complex scenarios, MCDM models are a suitable approach to decision-making.

The chronic responses of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to climatic factors on the Three-river Headwaters (TRH) region were assessed for major vegetation types at the herbage developmental stages using the geographical detectors model, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from remote sensing images, and precipitation and air temperature datasets from 2000 to 2019. The results indicated that precipitation was the dominant driver for alpine meadows and steppes, while the impact of temperature on alpine steppes was more evident than that in alpine meadows, and alpine shrubs were more responsive to warming changes. This was possibly because shallower root systems and larger plant leaf area promote the responses of ANPP to precipitation for alpine meadows and steppes, and dormant buds higher from the ground facilitate the impacts of temperature for alpine shrubs. Grasslands also demonstrated differentiated responses to climatic factors at different developmental stages. Precipitation during the previous withering (September–October), pre-growing season (March–April), and vegetative growth (May–June) stages were more influential for ANPP variations. In contrast, ANPP during the reproductive period from July to August exhibited a weaker response to climatic controls. This was possibly attributed to the bud bank replenishment in fall and spring, the largest biomass growth rates in vegetative growth stage, and the non-structural carbohydrates transferred from roots in reproductive stage for perennial herbaceous plants. An elevated temperature, combined with no significant change in precipitation on the TRH may lead to a decrease in ANPP in alpine meadows but alpine shrub expansion, resulting in a reduced supply of palatable forage sources and bringing challenges to grassland management.}

abstract = {Elevated business uncertainties and competition over recent years have caused changes to the data-driven supply chain management of sourcing and inventories across industries. However, only large-sized enterprises have the resources to harness data for aiding their decision-making and planning. By contrast, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) commonly have limited resources and knowledge, which affects their ability to collect and utilize data. Thus, it is a challenge for them to implement advanced decision support tools to mitigate the effects of market uncertainties. This paper proposes a decision support system (DSS) for sourcing and inventory management, with the aims of helping SMEs compile and exploit data, and supporting their decisions under business ambiguities. The DSS was developed using a simulation-optimization approach by incorporating an artificial neural network and a genetic algorithm for problem representation and optimizing decision support solutions. The exploitation of observational and empirical data reduces the burden of data compilation obtained from unorganized data sources across SME operations. Further, uncertainty factors such as raw material demand, price, and supply lead time were considered. When implemented in a medium-sized food industry company, the DSS can provide decision support solutions that integrate the selection of recommended suppliers and optimal order quantities. It can also help decision-makers to shape their inventory management policies under uncertain raw material demands, while also considering service levels, sales promotions, lead times, and material availability from multiple suppliers. Consequently, implementation of the DSS helped to reduce the total purchased raw material costs by an average of 51.62% and reduced the order interval and on-hand inventory costs by an average of 54.24%.}

abstract = {Background
Isotretinoin is a synthetic retinoid, derived from vitamin A, with multiple mechanisms of action and highly effective in the treatment of acne, despite common adverse events, manageable and dose-dependent. Dose-independent teratogenicity is the most serious. Therefore, off-label prescriptions require strict criteria.
Objective
To communicate the experience and recommendation of Brazilian dermatologists on oral use of the drug in dermatology.
Methods
Eight experts from five universities were appointed by the Brazilian Society of Dermatology to develop a consensus on indications for this drug. Through the adapted DELPHI methodology, relevant elements were listed and an extensive analysis of the literature was carried out. The consensus was defined with the approval of at least 70% of the experts.
Results
With 100% approval from the authors, there was no doubt about the efficacy of oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, including as an adjunct in the correction of scars. Common and manageable common adverse events are mucocutaneous in nature. Others, such as growth retardation, abnormal healing, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease have been thoroughly investigated, and there is no evidence of a causal association; they are rare, individual, and should not contraindicate the use of the drug. Regarding unapproved indications, it may represent an option in cases of refractory rosacea, severe seborrheic dermatitis, stabilization of field cancerization with advanced photoaging and, although incipient, frontal fibrosing alopecia. For keratinization disorders, acitretin performs better. In the opinion of the authors, indications for purely esthetic purposes or oil control are not recommended, particularly for women of childbearing age.
Conclusions
Approved and non-approved indications, efficacy and adverse effects of oral isotretinoin in dermatology were presented and critically evaluated.}

FMECA automation enabled by industrial knowledge graph and construction of Bayesian network for failure propagation is introduced in detail to enhance efficient integration of design and maintenance phases. A proof-of-concept simulation based on an electromechanical actuator validates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method, showing a closed-loop optimization of design and O&M services.

An innovation model can incorporate those three components to provide greater value to stakeholders, drive organizational growth, gain a competitive advantage and achieve greater end-user satisfaction. We investigated how an enterprise systems model for open innovation could be created based on existing innovation socio-technical frameworks and how that model may benefit the UK National Health Service (NHS). We carried out a literature review of enterprise systems models, cognitive and social-tech engineering and innovation management. Two researchers undertook a thematic analysis of 46 academic papers. Themes included business sectors, types of innovation strategy and the use of cognitive and social-tech engineering elements. Results show that little application of innovation models within the healthcare sector has been undertaken to foster innovation. We suggest that existing innovation frameworks such as the Innovation Pentathlon Framework, the NASA's partnering incentive and the Tesco club card scheme may be the basis for the creation of a healthcare innovation model that incorporates substantive human aspects, including human cognition and human reward. Since the cost of missing medical appointments in the NHS is around $1390 million dollars per year, our innovation model may be implemented to improve patient attendance to family doctors and hospital appointments. The model strategy comprises rewarding people with shopping vouchers (Tesco club card points or nectar points) each time they confirm or cancel a medical appointment online or by SMS text message. With this model, the NHS would improve the management of their resources, may improve the quality of service and may have higher user satisfaction. Nevertheless, future challenges may include the adaptation of current NHS business processes and the management of the collaboration with private organizations.}

The buzz surrounding technologies like 3D printing and artificial intelligence has many start-ups hoping to capitalise on this dream of creating personalised products at an affordable price, and well-established companies scrambling to innovate and maintain their market share. However, the majority of them are failing as they struggle to understand one key question – where does customization make sense? Customization and personalisation only make sense where the value of the perceived benefit outweighs the cost to implement it. In other words, will people pay for it? Looking at the Kano Model makes it clear that it depends on the product. In products where customization is an inherent need, like prosthetics, mass customization technologies can be highly beneficial. However, for products that already sell as a standard, like headphones, offering customization is likely only an added bonus, and so the product development team must figure out if the customers’ perception of the added value of this feature will outweigh its premium price tag. This can be done through the use of a ‘serious game,’ whereby potential customers are given a limited budget to collaboratively buy and bid on potential features of the product, before it is developed. If the group choose to buy customization over other features, then the product development team should implement it into their design. If not, the team should prioritize the features on which the customers have spent their budget. The level of customization purchased can also be translated to an appropriate production method. For example, the most expensive type of customization would likely be free-form design and could be achieved through digital fabrication, while a lower level could be achieved through short batch production. Twenty-eight teams of final year students from design, engineering, construction and technology tested this methodology when bringing a product from concept through to production plan and found that it allowed them to confidently decide what level of customization, if any, would be worth offering for their product, and what would be the best method of producing it. They also found that the discussion and negotiations between players during the game led to invaluable insights, and almost all teams said they would use the methodology in future product development projects, especially those from non-design backgrounds.}

This study introduces a framework using the Kano model [1] applied to job satisfaction. The model aims to discover job attributes and its affects by categorizing job attributes into three distinct Kano qualities. Importance Grid Analysis was reinterpreted in this study to complement the Kano questionnaire by determining improvement priorities. The steady increase of mature workers in the work force has prompted a relook at job design due to the different needs and capabilities of mature workers as compared to younger workers. The framework was then applied in a case study consisting of 210 mature employees in Singapore. Through this case study, we were able to identify the affect of job attributes and set improvement priorities for mature employees. Age was also found to have a significant effect on overall job satisfaction, stressing the importance of recognizing changing expectations with age. Management can then implement job redesign specifically for mature employees.}

That is consistent with the high complexity of those services, which demand resilient performance. Four H4.0 technologies were top ranked regarding their impacts on the resilience of those services.

To realize a truly sustainable packaging that consumers would actually select, packaging design should integrate consumer-preferred functions with low environmental impact. In other words, packaging design can influence consumer preferences by implementing specific packaging functions. However, the quantitative relationships between the consumer preferences and environmental impact of products with varying packaging designs are still to be revealed, which hinders the integration of these relationships in the packaging design procedure. In this study, a framework was developed to assist packaging designers in integrating consumer preferences and environmental impact during their design procedures. Our framework comprises three stages. The first two stages assess design options with regard to environmental impact and consumer preferences. The last stage integrates the results of the previous two stages based on the concept of eco-efficiency. To demonstrate the practicability of our framework, small portion sizes of potato salad products were analyzed as a case study. In the case study, the environmental impact and consumer preferences were assessed for 18 design options with different packaging functions using life cycle assessment and choice-based conjoint analysis, respectively. Furthermore, the relationships between them were quantitatively examined by integrating the assessment results. The case study results showed the trade-offs between the environmental and functional aspects, and the design option that seemed best in one respect did not always have the highest eco-efficiency. The results also indicated that our framework can support packaging designers in selecting consumer-preferred options with low environmental impact.}

Diurnal net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NECd), nocturnal net ecosystem CO2 loss (NECn) and soil CO2 efflux were measured repeatedly in the third year of CO2 exposure and were used to estimate an annual ecosystem CO2 budget. The CO2-induced stimulation of NECd varied over the year with no measurable stimulation in spring and fall but a high mid-season CO2 stimulation. Respiratory losses of whole ecosystems and soil CO2 efflux alone were both progressively increased with increasing CO2, thus counteracting the CO2 stimulation of photosynthesis per unit ground area. Consequently, the annual net ecosystem CO2 uptake was only moderately and non-linearly stimulated by CO2 (+8%=84 g C m−2 a−1 at 420 and +9%=90 g C m−2 a−1 at 560 compared to 280 μmol CO2 mol−1). We conclude that the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration may lead to an increase in annual net ecosystem carbon gain of rather nutrient-poor spruce communities. Our results further suggest that CO2 fertilization effects may be greatest under current CO2 concentration and that relative increases of net ecosystem CO2 uptake will become relatively smaller as atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise.
Résumé
Des clones d'épicéas (Picea abies) âgés de 4 ans ont été cultivés en compétition dans des éco-systèmes modèles sur un sol forestier naturel pauvre en nutriments et avec une végétation basse naturelle; ils ont été exposés à 3 concentrations en CO2 (280, 420 et 560 μmol mol−1) pendant 3 ans. Le prélèvement diurne net en CO2 de l'écosystème (NECd), la perte nocturne nette en CO2 de l'écosystème (NECn) et le dégagement de CO2 du sol ont été mesurés à plusieurs reprises au cours de la troisième année d'exposition au CO2 et ont été utilisés pour estimer un budget annuel de l'écosystème en CO2. La stimulation de NECd induite par le CO2 varie au cours de l'année sans stimulation mesu-rable au printemps et à l'automne mais avec une forte stimulation du CO2 en milieu de saison. Seuls les pertes respiratoires de l'écosystème entier et le dégagement de CO2 du sol augmentent progressivement avec une élévation du CO2, contrecarrant ainsi la stimulation de la photosynthèse par le CO2 par unité de surface. En conséquence, le prélèvement net annuel de l'écosystème en CO2 n'est stimulé que modérément et de façon non-linéaire par le CO2 (+8%=84 g C m−2 a−1 à 420 et +95=90 g C m−2 a−1 à 560 à comparer avec 280 μmol CO2 mol−1). Nous en concluons que l'augmentation de la concentration en CO2 atmosphérique peut mener à un accroissement de l'accumulation annuelle nette en carbone de l'écosystème de communautés d'épicéas plutôt pauvres en nutriments. Nos résultats suggèrent de plus que les effets de la fertilisation par le CO2 pourraient être très importants pour des concentrations courantes en CO2 et que les augmentations relatives du prélèvement net de l'écosystème en CO2 deviendront relativement plus faibles à mesure que le CO2 atmosphérique continuera d'augmenter.}

Attempts have been made to incorporate LCA in public and corporate processes and product related decision-making. The European Union’s eco-labeling schemes and the United Kingdom’s Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive have tried to integrate life cycle thinking with policy making. However, these efforts still have not made LCA an integral part of process and product selection and design. The absence of an easy to use tool for rapid reconnaissance is a basic limitation of the LCA application. A new life cycle indexing system — LInX — is proposed, which will facilitate the LCA application in process and product evaluation and decision-making. The LInX is comprised of four important sub-indices or attributes — environment, health and safety (EHS), cost, technical feasibility, and socio-political factors. Further, each attribute contains a number of basic parameters, e.g. EHS consists of 11 parameters. Quantification of each basic parameter is performed for the complete life cycle of a proposed process or product. An analytical hierarchy process is used to compute the weights for each basic parameter and sub-indices. A composite process is used to determine the final overall index. This paper explains the methodology for computation of the new indexing system and demonstrates it with an application.}

abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative model designed to predict the optimal product prototype within the framework of sustainable development. The model takes into account both quality and environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle of the product, with a specific focus on light electric vehicles. By incorporating customer expectations using the Weighted Sum Model, the model assesses vehicle quality based on the importance of various criteria. Employing life cycle evaluations guided by the Pareto-Lorenz rule, environmental impact for vehicle prototypes is modeled. The resulting Quality-Environmental Indicator of LCA (QLCA) facilitates a qualitative environmental analysis, aiding in the selection of prototypes that align with customer expectations. The model proves effective in guiding decisions related to product development, providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating product value. Notable contributions to the scientific community include the introduction of the QLCA model, which integrates quality and environmental assessments, and underscores the significance of open innovation, sustainable development, and sensitivity analysis for organizational adaptation. Future research directions involve adapting the model to larger customer samples, exploring production costs, and assessing its applicability across diverse industries and contexts to enhance its universality and practical implications.}

This is achieved through documentation and explanation of goals, constraints and requirements and their interrelations, which the members of the engineering team and individual decision-makers are aware of. This is followed by recurrent discussions and consensuses thereof which enables them to work together more efficiently as roles, tasks and responsibilities are unambiguously defined and effectively as it enables the team to alter a set of objectives in specific aspects and to track progress efficiently. The transfer of the results of existing research in modeling objectives into professional settings is rather difficult and requires methodical support. The requirements for tools, methods and processes to model objectives in predevelopment projects are unclear. Therefore, the perceived added value of existing approaches and tools is too small which leads to restraint in the industry. This research effort identifies requirements for methods and processes to model objectives in predevelopment projects. On that basis, the identified requirements are evaluated regarding their importance. Afterwards, existing methods are summarized and categorized. This is done by means of a systematic literature review and studies based on a predevelopment project with a duration of half a year. 41 graduate students in seven teams develop seven products and showcase their concepts in several prototypes with guidance of methodology experts. Engineers of an industry partner and a research facility review the current results and progress and decide the further course of action in milestones. This research consists of expert interviews, surveys and consulting of the engineering teams.}

Remanufacturing cost, energy consumption and material consumption are taken as the redesign objectives. In accordance with these objectives and its constraints, a dynamic information transfer and feedback model (DITF) is adopted to achieve collaborative optimization between used mechanical equipment and used parts.

Hence, their outcome is not always successful due to information asymmetry among stakeholders. To visualize this disparity, this article proposes a context modelling method, which identifies factor causing information asymmetry in PSS design. A design scene in business demonstrates that the proposed method visualizes the asymmetry among various PSS stakeholders.}

We propose a methodology using descriptive analytics and axiomatic design framework. In this study, we have analysed injury, and ‘property-damage’ data, collected for 45 months from a large integrated steel plant. The data are analysed using the contingency table, Cramer’s V, Phi coefficients (ϕ) and Fisher’s exact test. The ‘wire-making division’ is the most injury-prone. Unsafe acts done by fellow workers are significantly causing injuries in ‘support services’, maintenance and ‘steel-making’. The property-damage cases are mostly reported in ‘steel-making division’, and caused by material-handling, crane-dashing, toxic-chemical, hot-metal and process-related incidents. It is also found that SOP inadequacy and non-compliance are significantly associated with ‘property-damage’ incidents. The key interventions from axiomatic design are as follows. For process-related incidents, regular inspection and maintenance of safety-critical equipment should be done. Safety-critical instrument and alarms can also be used to monitor safe operating limits of processes. Unsafe acts by fellow workers are the result of lack of coordination and communication. So, the management should identify and provide the types of safety training necessary to improve the same. The material-handling related problems can be handled through improved staff competency and communication. To address the SOP related issues, operating procedures should be reviewed, revised and communicated regularly.}

In fact, supply chain vulnerability is now a major concern in many organizations as some research programs have started to illustrate that modern supply chains are at greater risks than their supply chain managers could even recognise. The aim of this article is to analyse these risks and discuss how they could be prevented and/or managed. In addition, by implementing ICT in collaboration with certain strategies, a resilient supply chain could be developed. Moreover, in case any of these risks occur, the possibility for an organization to be able to bounce back and start operations in the shortest possible time is also considered.}

Corporate CE entails the adoption of several value-retention options (R-strategies) throughout companies’ operations, which aim at creating, preserving and recovering the value of assets and products. The sustainable product development (SPD) process, in which around 80% of the total environmental impact of a product is determined, is employed to translate R-strategies into new product requirements. This study is aimed at investigating the implications of R-strategy adoption for decision-making in SPD. The research follows an empirical approach, combining a literature review and in-depth semi-structured interviews with product developers and sustainability experts working in companies operating in the technical material cycles of the CE. Thus, implications for product dimensions, inter- and intraorganisational actors, decision-making support types and lifecycle information flows so that SPD processes further accommodate CE principles into products are investigated. This study reveals new directions to adjust the contextual factors of SPD to further align existing processes with widely expanding CE organisational cultures.}

This technology has automated the day-to-day jobs and thus made our lives easier. But, real-time analysis of data is not always possible in a typical cloud-IoT architecture, especially for latency-sensitive applications. This led to the introduction of fog computing. On one side, fog layer has the capability of data processing and computation at the network edge and thus provides faster results. But, on the other hand, it also brings the attack surface closer to the devices. This makes the sensitive data on the layer vulnerable to attacks. Thus, considering Fog-IoT security is of prime importance. The security of a system or platform depends upon multiple factors. The order of selection of these factors plays a vital role in efficient assessment of security. This makes the problem of assessment of Fog-IoT security a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. Therefore, the authors have deployed an Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IVIFS) based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for the said environment. Using this integrated approach, the Fog-IoT security factors and their sub-factors are prioritized and ranked. The results obtained using above hybrid approach are validated by comparing them with Fuzzy-AHP (F-AHP) and Classical- AHP (C-AHP) results and are found to statistically correlated. The ideology and results of this research will help the security practitioners in accessing the security of Fog-IoT environment effectively. Moreover, the outcome of this analysis will help in paving a path for researchers by shifting their focus towards the most prioritized factor thereby assuring security in the environment.}

Then DEA is used to compare the outputs of different scenarios. These scenarios are generated by observing the effects of various parameters such as lengthening or shortening treatment times, decreasing or increasing patient volumes and removing or adding staff members. As the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that presents an integrated approach based on computer simulation and DEA to concurrently incorporate the stated factors and parameters for optimization of complex ICUs in developing countries.

It exhibits dynamic nature and is multidimensional, since a large network of stakeholders are usually involved in the design and development of PSS eco-systems and their influence must be considered during the evaluation of the PSS offering. Nevertheless, an effective PSS evaluation can determine the market success of the PSS offering, leading to fewer design modifications and shortened time-to-market. Still, existing literature lacks an exhaustive review and classification of PSS evaluation approaches. Moreover, a lack of critical in-depth validation of performance approaches in real industrial environments is observed. Towards bridging this gap, the present work identifies the most important perspectives in the PSS ecosystem, such as supplier selection and service level, and discusses the utilised evaluation approaches used for each of them. Based on this review, a classification of existing PSS evaluation approaches is provided, by mapping these PSS eco-system perspectives to the methods most frequently used for their evaluation. The results can be used as guidelines for PSS vendors to select the most suitable method for the evaluation of their PSS offerings.}

However, when there is interaction among the evaluation objectives, existing decision methods are difficult to determine the influence degree of each objective on the overall design desirability, which can lead to an unreliable decision regarding the most optimal scheme. In addition, it is difficult to deal with the vague judgments for qualitative objectives in decision-making under subjective decision environment. To maximize the overall design desirability of the scheme, An integrated product conceptual scheme decision approach based on Shapley value method and fuzzy logic model is proposed to transform the multi-objective conflict into a game problem of multi-objective trade-offs. The model is divided into two parts. First part is to use the evidence-based trust function and fuzzy logic model to integrate the group of detailed or imprecise evaluation data; this improves the reliability of the empirical data. Second, by aiming to maximize the overall design interest, SHVM in the coalitional game solves the optimal expectation for each objective and decides the optimal scheme. Finally, a shearer rocker height-adjusting device case study is presented to illustrate the applications, and a conceptual scheme trade-off decision prototype system is developed based on the approach for verification.

abstract = {In this article, a usage-driven perspective is taken to analyze the lack of industrial uptake of ecodesign tools in the construction sector. Eleven interviews with professionals were carried out to gain insight into the building design process, the roles of the different actors and their interactions. Nineteen further interviews investigated ecodesign knowledge and practice, and the barriers to wider implementation of this approach. The data drawn from the interviews were analyzed with the Dependency Structure Modelling Value Bucket (DSM VB) algorithm. The algorithm maps usage situations, designer issues and existing ecodesign tools to highlight gaps in the available offer for ecodesign tools. It appears that ecodesign tools are missing in the early design stages, and that what is most needed in these phases are tools for multicriteria analysis (economic, social, and environmental) and benchmarking. Tools answering these needs, combined with desirable changes we identified in the design process, would help ecodesign adoption.}

abstract = {COVID-19 has been impacting worldwide supply chains causing interruption, closure of production and distribution. This impact has been drastic on the supplier side and, as a consequence of disruptions, strong reductions of production have been estimated. Such a circumstance forces companies to propose innovative best practices of supply chain risk management aimed at facing vulnerability generated by COVID-19 and pursuing industrial improvements in manufacturing and production environments. As a part of supply chain strategy, supplier selection criteria should be revised to include pandemic-related risks. This article aims to propose an answer to such a problem. In detail, a comprehensive tool designed as a hybrid combination of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods is suggested to manage important stages connected to the production development cycle and to provide companies with a structured way to rank risks and easily select their suppliers. The main criteria of analysis will be first identified from the existent literature. Risks related to COVID-19 will be then analysed in order to elaborate a comprehensive list of potential risks in the field of interest. The Best Worst Method (BWM) will be first used to calculate criteria weights. The Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) will be then applied to rank and prioritize risks affecting suppliers. The effectiveness of the approach will be tested through a case study in the sector of automotive industry. The applicability of the designed MCDM framework can be extended also to other industrial sectors of interest.}

Rather than explaining them again, this paper's objective is to explore the sequence of events leading to JPM as a competitive force globally, as well as its impact on theory and practices in operations management. JPM's evolution includes shifting terminologies, fusions and adulterations; limited extensions from manufacturing into services and innovative enhancements, largely of Western origin. Longitudinal research data, based on inventory trends, provide insights on JPM's diffusions and its uneven results. Latter-day puzzling lapses and disappointments, among Japanese as well as Western companies, raise questions about JPM's sustainability, as well as some of its changing manifestations.

Green packaging design must follow the principles of sustainability, that is, reducing the consumption of packaging materials, refilling packaging containers, recycling and recycling packaging materials, and degrading packaging materials, but how to implement its basic ideas into conventional product design and development In order to form a practical overall pattern of the green packaging design process, it is the key to the universal acceptance and application of green packaging design. The goal of this study is to create a long-term solution for disposing of single-use food packaging waste. The Internet of Thing (IoT) technologies and alternative management techniques for throwaway food containers are the designed model for the suggested solution. The key to running cold chain logistics in a sustainable and low-carbon manner is proper optimization modeling, which also provides the required groundwork for creation of a data-driven modeling system. The final efficiency of the packaging throughout circulation is crucial for achieving constant loss minimization and efficient supply, as effective packaging is required for loss control. Therefore, it is crucial to figure out how to make use of these continually collected data and ways to develop a extra precise packing efficiency control mechanism in the cold chain for agri-products. By concentrating on the idea of data-driven assessment modeling as well as the dynamic creation mechanism of complete packaging efficiency, researchers continuously monitored the viability of this topic. The assessment of efficiency index system and approach for data-driven assessment described were evaluated using the packaging efficiency of cold chain for table grapes as an instance. The solution encourages the creation of regional socio-economic ecosystems for a circular economy.}

The problem with this approach is that introduction of new technologies leads to increased functionality that alters the economic and environmental impacts. In addition, a growing market leads to the demand for higher volume of products. When these factors are combined, overall increase in economic and environmental impacts occurs in the society even though improvements were made at product level. Therefore, this research article proposes a new approach to product assessment to cater for technology changes and increasing volume. Using Axiomatic Design Theory, the drivers of economic and environmental impacts are identified by characterising these impacts as a function of product features. The assessment method is applied for a range of functionality and increasing volume to determine the total economic and environmental impact caused in society. Furthermore, ratio analysis is used to determine the economic and environmental impact changes over product generations to identify additional environmental improvements needed to reach target score. The methodology is validated using a comparative case study of different battery technologies for a range of functionality and assumed volume increase in the next generation of batteries to be produced.}

The idea is that the configuration decision-making process is regarded as the game for different disciplines and technologies, and the aircraft components are players. The payoff function with highest total gain means that according to the game protocols and multidimensional theory, the optimal aircraft configuration within the strategy set will be chosen. The decision-making model is applied to conceptual design process of the high altitude long endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on the assessment of technological risk. The obtained optimum configuration is quite consistent with the current HALE UAV development trends. Thus, taking into account the coupling and interference factors, the multidimensional gaming model based on aircraft components will be an effective analysis method in the decision-making process of aircraft optimum configuration.}

DMADICV is a novel method proposed in the current study for Six Sigma. The proposed DMADICV framework consists of six key constructs: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Improve, and Control & Verify. These constructs are used as layers in smart cities, and relevant literature is reviewed to highlight the key factors and groups related to each layer. A conceptual framework is provided for smart city management and an assessment mechanism presented for measuring and testing the performance of smart city integrated processes. This is achieved by measuring and controlling the cost of quality non-conformance, right documentation in the first time, and timely implementation of control measures, the activity processing index, and quality controls. Improvement construct has a percentage of 35.67 % share in the DMADICV framework followed by define (16.76 %), design (15.52 %), control & verify (14.33 %), measure (10.08 %), and analyze (8.15 %). The top ten factors for managing smart cities through the Six Sigma method include process quality improvement, organizational development, process analysis, quality management, cost control, DMAIC, change management, project management plan, waste reduction, process quality measurement, and value creation, respectively. The DMADICV framework and its dynamic relations are shown through a system model and its key groups represented in layers of the smart cities whereby the city governance and management teams can provide services to their smart citizens effectively and efficiently. The proposed DMADICV method and associated smart city management framework are a humble addition to the body of knowledge that can be adopted and utilized in other knowledge fields.}

Automotive companies trail top supply chains in implementing risk management practices. Prediction of potential failure points and overall impact of these risks is challenging. In this research, we aim to assess the major risks that are encountered in supply chain of automobile industry. The purpose of this paper is to develop a holistic, systematic and quantitative risk assessment for measuring the overall risk behavior.

However, the AD theory does not provide such an approach to support the transformation from FRs to DPs. As the meantime, there is a trend to use internet-based knowledge service in a distributed resource environment to efficiently generate a design concept. The authors aim at developing an improved axiomatic design approach. This approach consists of two parts, part 1 built a new model for the transformation from FRs to DPs in a distributed resource environment; part 2 proposed an achieving algorithm for the generation of Function unit chain sets (FUCSs). The studies are based on a hypothesis that almost all of the FRs can be met by a function unit set. The DPs of each Function Unit (FU) are provided by knowledge service suppliers. In such a distributed resource environment, designers only need to search function units via their inputs and outputs and integrate them into a concept solution to meet a functional requirement. This paper firstly defined the basic definitions of Functional Requirements (FRs), Functions (Fs), Function Units (FUs), Function unit sets (FUSs), Function unit chain sets (FUCSs) and Design Parameters (DPs), then described the transformation process in detail, thirdly, proposed principle forms for calculating the outputs in FUSs, finally, used a case study to illustrate the proposed approach by analyzing the design process of a friction-abrasion testing machine.}

Because of being limited by the known and inherent features, KE can only generate a limited number of new modeling without providing a rich source of creativity. To get rid of the shackles of inherent characteristics, KE and Association Creative Thinking Method (ACTM) are combined in this paper to stimulate the bionic design creativity. The creativity of bionic design comes from the association of highly ordered Kansei vocabulary, and the product form derived from this can significantly enhance emotional value and user satisfaction. The electronic scale is taken as an example and the research is divided into three stages. Firstly, samples and Kansei words are widely selected; the priority order of each Kansei word is obtained after continuous fuzzy Kano model analysis. Secondly, after morphological analysis deconstructs product features, support vector regression establishes an engineering model between the highest-ranking Kansei words and products’ form features so as to generate the optimal product design. Finally, after six operational steps of ACTM, a series of biologically inspired creative designs are obtained. The research results found that: 1. Customers ranked their Kansei needs for electronic scales in order of cute, fashionable, and elegant. 2. The circular appearance, square screen, U-shaped mechanical key and other styling components can easily trigger customers’ cute emotional needs. 3. The biomimetic design of fish tail, cat paw, and octopus style meets the Kansei needs of customers and provides parameter guidance for manufacturers. Compared to traditional KE, which only obtains the optimal design combination for morphological analysis table, combining ACTM’s biomimetic inspired design makes creative shapes more vivid and interesting, improving market sales and the success rate of new product development.}

Discussions on how to achieve this target are usually mass-driven focusing on recycling quotas but neglecting quality targets. However, the circular economy aims to preserve resources at their highest possible value focusing on both mass and quality conservation, to close material loops in the long term. Therefore, changes in physical properties of recycled plastics compared to virgin plastics should be addressed, but measuring quality is a complex task. This article introduces a functional requirement matrix approach to assess mass and quality conservation using an indicator called circularity potential based on physical properties. The indicator is demonstrated in a case study on a non-food pouch made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Two samples from mechanical and dissolution recycling were examined in a laboratory and compared to virgin LDPE. We built on existing studies, but further introduced thermal and aesthetic requirements as well as established weighting and compliance parameters to address the complexity of quality conservation. The exemplary case study shows a circularity potential of 49% for recycled LDPE from dissolution recycling and 30% for mechanically recycled LDPE Mass and quality conservation are higher for dissolution than for mechanical recycling, but also rely on different waste streams that offer future research need. Further sensitivity analysis demonstrated the significance of weighting and compliance parameters. The provided approach is configurable for specific product applications and applicable in the context of life cycle assessments.}

: App developers spend exhaustive manual efforts towards the identification and prioritization of informative end-user reviews. Informative reviews are those that express end-users’ requests for new features, bug fixes and possible enhancements. Problem Statement: While prior studies have proposed approaches to convert app reviews into actionable knowledge, these are limited in utility due to being domain knowledge dependent or manually-based.
Objective
: In this study, in order to facilitate app maintenance and evolution cycles, we develop two novel automated prioritization techniques to rank informative reviews, and also compare their performances.
Method
: We developed the techniques comprising of entropy, frequency, TF-IDF and sentiment scoring methods using reviews from four popular apps comprising more than 1000 informative reviews in each app. Time and accuracy metrics were then used to measure the performance of our techniques. We performed evaluations where the ranking outcomes generated by our techniques were compared to those provided by regular app users and developers using two rounds of evaluations (internal and external evaluations).
Results
: Our results show that the time required for prioritization was in the range of 17–25 s and the accuracy of prioritization was in the range of 73–90%.
Conclusion
: These are promising outcomes when compared to prior work, where our outcomes were 4% and 185% better in terms of accuracy and time respectively. Thus, it is anticipated that our proposed techniques could support app developers in identifying and prioritizing informative reviews.}

abstract = {Supply chain resilience (SCRES) is an emerging research area, which plays a crucial role in protecting supply chains (SCs) against small- to large-scale disruptions. Over the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing SCRES strategies that have significantly contributed to mitigating SC disruptions. While the number of papers on this subject has been gradually increasing, the absence of a systematic literature review means that it is unclear which SCRES strategies for mitigating SC disruptions have already been studied and which issues still need to be investigated. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a systematic literature review to provide a comprehensive overview of SC resilience initiatives and strategies. For the review and synthesis conducted in this paper, 151 relevant articles were identified through a systematic search and selection of papers published between 2010 and 2021. First, the main themes of the SCRES strategies were categorized. The development of SCRES strategies for preparedness, response, and recovery, aimed at mitigating SC disruptions, was reviewed. Second, a detailed analysis of research developments in SCRES strategies was conducted, along with an investigation into the methodological, theoretical, and contextual justifications for tackling SC disruptions. Third, literature on SCRES strategies was synthesized for mapping and identifying potential research gaps. The analysis revealed that there is a scarcity of simulation model-based and theoretically grounded studies to mitigate large-scale SC disruptions. Moreover, it was also found that most studies have identified SCRES strategies for low-demand luxury products, while high-demand essential products and services have largely been ignored. Finally, based on the analysis, this article identifies research questions and future research directions for the field of SCRES research. These can guide academics and practitioners in designing and leading effective research in the field.}

Based on the concept of “focus first, then extend”, this study presents a new approach called the New Comprehensive Patent Analysis model (NCPA) which combines the patent family with patent citation analysis in a new product design process. The procedure includes the following features: (1) integrating the perspective of management-based and technology-based design for patent searching, (2) building a patent family based on industry basic patents, (3) filtering the patent family to obtain key patents, (4) utilizing patent citations to gain necessary technology information in product development design, and (5) combining TRIZ theory to construct patent technology performance maps, and to discover product niches. This NCPA model is empirically applied in a real case. The results show that the NCPA improves the overall efficiency of new product designs, but also involves higher cost than other approaches.}

abstract = {In recent years, the economic circumstances spur many companies in changing their traditional product-oriented value proposition toward a more customised and sustainable offer referred as Product-Service Systems (PSS). The main advantages of the new solutions are related to their customisation which can grant an improved customer experience. However, while pursuing greater differentiation from competitors and ‘locking-in’ customers and ‘locking-out’ competitors, many of the above-cited companies either miss interesting business opportunities or bet on the wrong solution concept. Early stage engineering phase plays a crucial role concerning the subsequent lifecycle phases, guiding the identification and the selection of valuable solutions while preventing commitment of resources on poor design alternatives. In the light of the criticality of this phase, this paper builds on empirical studies in the manufacturing industry and highlights the need for systematic procedures, methods and metrics able to encompass customer satisfaction together with the producer’s value perspective during the early design assessment. The outcome of the paper is the Engineering Value Assessment (EVA) method. It is a 2 step procedure composed of multi-criteria decision-making methods with specific criteria for a comprehensive value assessment of PSS from both the customers’ and the provider’s perspectives. The EVA also guides the identification of trade-off between the two through the Importance-Performance Analysis. Verification activities in the power and automation industry highlight the main benefits and the implications of the EVA method in guiding the decision making in the early stages of design and in balancing the trade-off between customer and provider value during the PSS assessment phase. Further developments and improvements are also discussed.}

The physical flow of products in traditional supply chains is replaced by the digital flow of information in DSCs. This digitalization has changed the conventional supplier selection processes. We propose an integrated and comprehensive fuzzy multicriteria model for supplier selection in DSCs. The proposed model integrates the fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) with the fuzzy multi-objective optimization based on ratio analysis plus full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA), fuzzy complex proportional assessment of alternatives (COPRAS), and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy BWM approach is used to measure the importance weights of the digital criteria. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA, fuzzy COPRAS, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods are used as prioritization methods to rank the suppliers. The maximize agreement heuristic (MAH) is used to aggregate the supplier rankings obtained from the prioritization methods into a consensus ranking. We present a real-world case study in a manufacturing company to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on selecting suppliers in the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry by developing a comprehensive approach for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on alternative methods capable of assessing different aspects of supplier selection uncertainty in terms of utility functions and criteria related to efficiency. The O&G industry has a key role in the public sector of various countries such as Iran with its revenues being of prime importance to develop infrastructure facilities such as for healthcare, education, and transportation. This comprehensive approach walks through various stages for selecting Critical Success Factors (CSFs), ranking suppliers, and for setting partial weighting alternatives. While CSFs are selected using a traditional Delphi approach, the partial supplier rankings are defined based on Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) utility functions together with criteria weights derived from Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) for each CSF. As it concerns information reliability of utility and efficiency functions of both methods obtained via expert preferences or perceptions, Z-numbers are used to address the intrinsic fuzziness level inherent to each analytical stage. Iran's economy depends on revenues from oil and other related production, which means that by earning more income from this industry, most of its economic indicators such as GDP and employment rate should increase significantly, thus leading to economic growth. Various countries put plans in place related to production for increasing their social economics. One of these plans is focused on suppliers since they have a high impact on providing essential items such as equipment, HR, and transportation, so by choosing the best suppliers in all fields, costs will decrease and consequently revenue will increase. This research points out how to rank O&G industry suppliers using MCDA methods in an uncertain environment. An example based on actual data from an Iranian O&G company is provided to show the applicability of the approach proposed. Results suggest that the complexity of O&G operations on selecting suppliers can be adequately handled by information reliability techniques applied to traditional economic concepts such as utility- and efficiency-related factors, particularly in business environments characterized by a trade embargo.}

abstract = {Faced with fierce competition in marketplaces, manufacturers need to determine the appropriate settings of engineering characteristics of the new products so that the best customer preferences of the products can be obtained. To achieve this, functional models relating customer preferences to engineering characteristics need to be developed. As information regarding functional relationships between customer preferences are generally subjective or heuristic in nature, development of the customer preference models involve two uncertainties, namely fuzziness and randomness. Existing approaches use only fuzzy-based technologies to address the uncertainty caused by fuzziness. They are not designed to address the randomness of the observed data which is caused by a limited knowledge of the variability of influences between customer preferences and engineering characteristics. In this article, a fuzzy ordinary regression method is proposed to develop the customer preference models which are capable of addressing the two uncertainties of crispness and fuzziness of the customer preferences. A case study of a tea maker design which involves both uncertainties is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

With changing societal requirements in terms of the global risk-based economy, SCMs should be resilient and flexible to handle risk and quickly respond to disruptions. A food supply chain (FSC) is a critical global supply chain network due to its crucial role in meeting the growing consumer demand for edible products. Any disruptions and risks in FSC management (FSCM) may lead to irrecoverable and costly consequences; therefore, the resiliency of key players in the food SCM is very important. In this regard, this paper develops a decision-making model using the best worst method (BWM) and fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (fuzzy MARCOS) to measure the resiliency of key players in the FSCM with respect to different resiliency and risk factors. Sensitivity analysis tests to examine the reliability of the model are conducted. A case study of the agricultural FSCM of Andalusia Province of Spain is used to investigate the practicability of the proposed model. The results indicate that natural disasters and water system failures are two important risk factors with the highest weight coefficients, and excessive inventory was determined to be the least important risk factor. Moreover, supermarkets and wholesalers are determined to be the most resilient players in the FSCM of Andalusia Province of Spain.}

Four leading vendors including Victory XR, ARuVR, zSpace, and Varjo Technologies are assessed, with zSpace emerging as the most favorable alternative with the highest overall utility value of 0.6889.

Fueled by the growing popularity of energy-saving and environmentally friendly ideas and policies, new energy technologies and their supporting industries are experiencing constant development and refinement. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs) are steadily displacing traditional fuel-powered vehicles as the dominant force in the vehicle market. The experience economy is driving a significant shift in the direction of EV development, which is transitioning from improving functionality to optimizing the emotional connection consumers have with their vehicles. This means the form factor of the vehicle itself is becoming a key element in attracting consumers and influencing purchasing decisions. Over half of China's EV consumer market is comprised of females. However, many companies continue to develop products solely from a male perspective, missing out on a vast market opportunity. Therefore, incorporating design elements that cater to female aesthetic preferences into EVs can undoubtedly play a crucial role in unlocking this significant segment of the market. Based on this, the paper proposes a form generative design approach that specifically caters to the preferences of female consumers within the theoretical framework of Kansei engineering. The research process begins by obtaining Kansei imagery through the collection and analysis of big data. Subsequently, eye-tracking experiments are conducted to define the key design elements of the automobiles. Concurrently, appropriate aesthetic measurement indicator (AMI) system is established. Next, AMI values are computed for the sample set. This data is then leveraged to create a mapping relationship with the Kansei imagery, enabling the objective reflection of subjective aesthetic evaluations. Finally, an integrated Kansei evaluation equation serves as the fitness function within a generative approach that utilizes genetic algorithms and visual AI to produce form design solutions for electric vehicles. The evaluation confirms that the proposed design approach successfully generates a substantial number of high-quality creative solutions that align with female aesthetic preferences, while maintaining low cost and high efficiency.}

abstract = {Background
Studies focusing on hemorrhagic presentation of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have largely limited their analysis to angiographic features. We report the importance of race/ethnicity as a clinical factor associated with hemorrhagic AVM presentation in addition to previously reported angiographic features.
Methods
Data were prospectively and retrospectively collected on patients (N = 194) during the period 1993–2010 who presented with a single intracranial AVM, and baseline characteristics were compared for hemorrhagic presentation versus nonhemorrhagic presentation. Features that were statistically significant in univariate analysis or clinically significant were included in a multivariate analysis.
Results
The median age at presentation was 32 years; 37.2% of patients were male. Spetzler-Martin grades were I in 17.5%, II in 37.1%, III in 28.9%, IV in 14.9%, and V in 1.5%. Baseline characteristics that differed significantly between patients presenting with hemorrhage compared with patients without hemorrhage were the following: race (P < 0.01), AVM size (P < 0.01), <3 feeding arteries (P = 0.01), absence of middle cerebral artery supply to AVM (P < 0.01), and AVM location (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed nonwhite race (odds ratio [OR] = 3.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52, 6.44], P < 0.01); smaller AVM size (OR = 0.65 [95% CI = 0.19, 0.86], P < 0.01); and nonfrontal lobar (OR = 2.61 [95% CI = 1.2, 5.59], P = 0.02), basal ganglia (OR = 6.20 [95% CI = 1.52, 26.26], P = 0.01), or brainstem locations (OR = 4.41 [95% CI = 1.38, 14.92], P = 0.01) as factors associated with hemorrhagic presentation of brain AVMs.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that race/ethnicity is significantly associated with hemorrhagic presentation of AVMs. We also confirmed previous observations that AVM size and location are associated with hemorrhagic presentation.}

abstract = {Some important trends can be noticed in the global market place. Such trends are increased demands on more individualized products, cheaper product prices, faster delivery, improved product quality, and shorter product life cycles. These trends call for stability and efficiency at the same time as they call for creativity and flexibility, which is a contradiction. To solve one part of the problem, two types of organization must live side by side; the innovation push project organization for new innovations, and the process-centered organization that takes care of the present market need. A recommendation is that 20% of the total R&D budget is allocated to innovation push projects. Money is, however, not enough to be successful. By using methods that shorten the product development time and that simultaneously increase creativity in the product and process development processes, the odds for success are improved. Dynamic Product Development (DPD) is such a method. However, another annoyingly strong trend is that larger companies are increasingly outsourcing their production, which means a step backwards as new physical and mental walls are raised between product developers and production process developers. This paper also points out the importance of distinguishing between customers and users when performing product development.}

More recently, environmental concerns required that disassembly and recycling issues should be considered during the design stages. The effort to reduce total life-cycle costs for a product through design innovation is becoming an essential part of the current manufacturing industry. Therefore, researchers begin to focus their attention on design for environment, design for recyclability, design for life-cycle (DFLC), etc. These studies are sometimes referred to as Design for X (DFX). Since the late 1990s, hundreds of papers have been published pertaining to DFX applications in manufacturing. Most of them are widely distributed over many different disciplines and publications. This makes it very difficult for one to locate all the information necessary for the application of DFX in manufacturing. A paper that can help researchers and practitioners applying this emerging technology is highly desirable. The objective of this paper is to present the concepts, applications, and perspectives of ‘DFX’ in manufacturing, thus providing some guidelines and references for future research and implementation.}

The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, served as the objective function for optimization in Taguchi methods, is a useful tool for the evaluation of manufacturing processes. Most studies and applications focus on the calculation of S/N ratios with deterministic observations, and the literature receives little attention to the consideration of S/N ratio with fuzzy observations. This paper develops a fuzzy nonlinear programming model to calculate the fuzzy S/N ratio for the assessment of the manufacturing processes with fuzzy observations. A pair of nonlinear fractional programs is formulated to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy S/N ratio. By model reduction and variable substitutions, this pair of nonlinear fractional programs is transformed into quadratic programs. Solving the transformed quadratic programs, we obtain the optimum solutions of the lower bound and upper bound fuzzy S/N ratio. By deriving the ranking indices of the fuzzy S/N ratios of manufacturing process alternatives, the evaluation result of the alternatives is obtained.}

To that end, an exploratory research was carried out in two steps: (i) narrative bibliographic review and (ii) a field research. The (i) bibliographic review was conducted in the “Web of Science” and “Scopus” databases. The (ii) field research was executed with managers of 18 industries of different segments. Regarding the theoretical research, results show the state-of-the-art in academic research on product development process and sustainability practices, which provided support for the design of the data collection instrument and for the reference system suggested at the end of the work. As to the field research, results show that the sampled organizations understand the need for product and process environmental sustainability and they define internal drivers for the adoption of adequate practices, adapting such practices to the regulatory pressures and to market demands. Nevertheless, environmental matters do not comprise a dominant topic on product development. In this sense, we propose a reference model that aims to support companies to strategically align environmental aspects to the product development process. Although literature describes specific reference models, the need for a new system is justified since previous models presented specificities, lacked both post development assessment phases and introductory phases of product planning before the conceptual design. Therefore, the reference system proposed present phases that precede the development process (Sustainability-Oriented Organizational Strategic Planning; Portfolio Strategic Planning; and Project Strategic Planning), followed by the development phases (Operational Planning of the Product; Production Preparation; and Product's Launch Plan), and one post-development phase (Market Follow-Up of the Product). Future studies can apply the model in real cases through the action research method.}

Taguchi's Parameter Design links and optimizes the outputs of tasks (2), (3), and (4). In this paper, an L27 orthogonal array was constructed and seven injection process parameters were tested for a circular plate.

Yet, the outcome of a successful design results from a definition of the functional requirements that accurately reflect the customer needs. The contribution of this paper is to help defining a theoretical framework to describe the customer needs and the related functional requirements, using the ‘Theory of Practices’ (TP). This theory highlights every human activity in terms of a set of actions called ‘practices’. Practices relate to the actions required to fulfill a need through three variables: a material support, a competence to perform the action and a meaning that arises from the action. TP also takes into account the surrounding functions of the practice, defining them according to the milieu of its usage. Thus, TP allows a clear identification of the customer needs to fulfill and facilitates the scrutiny of the related functional requirements.}

Corers are multi-part products, encompassing extensive redundant assembly information stemming from the intricate assembly processes and numerous components. Thus, designing assembly systems for corers poses complexity challenges. This paper proposes an automated assembly system design framework, comprising assembly process analysis and system development. The proposed framework offers comprehensive design processes for multi-part product assembly systems, emphasizing managing information amount and complexity during the design phase. Specially, design principles and methods for minimizing information amount are analysed. And the directed graph is utilized to express the assembly information. Building upon this foundation, automated assemblability assessment and assembly process modular clustering is proposed to amalgamate and streamline assembly information, thus reducing design complexity. Leveraging pre-processed assembly information, the sub-functional solutions for assembly system are solved and optimized with AD (Axiomatic Design) and TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving). A case study of the deep-sea gas hydrate corer validated the effectiveness of the proposed methods in reducing information amount and yielding sub-functional solutions, thereby facilitating overall system design realization. Assembly experiments verified the designed system accomplished functional requirements. This study serves as a valuable reference for automated assembly analysis and system development for multi-part products, offering technical insights into developing deep in-situ cores from an assembly perspective.}

abstract = {The potential positive contributions of urban factories towards the sustainable development of cities have been increasingly recognized in recent years. Urban factories can contribute to the economic development and social welfare of cities. However, factories embedded in urban surroundings are still often associated with negative impacts such as noise, light, or particle emissions. The impacts of a specific urban factory result from the interrelationship between the factory, its products and the city. Products define the design and operation of its factory system in various aspects. In order to capture potential interdependencies and impacts of urban factories on their urban surroundings, it is crucial to take a holistic product perspective to avoid problem shifting. We propose a framework and an analytical methodology based on an influence analysis to elaborate the impacts resulting from manufacturing products in urban areas. First, relevant product characteristics are identified that mainly determine the design and operation of their urban production system. In a second step, urban impact categories are investigated to elaborate the potential influences of urban factories on their urban surrounding. The developed methodology can help to identify the product characteristics with the main leverage to reduce negative impacts. Based on these findings, the methodology subsequently can serve as a tool for designing urban products considering the most relevant characteristics towards the vision of a positive impact factory.}

The following four intertwined mechanisms were identified as key integrators: (1) Standards, procedures and plans, (2) milestone and design review practice, (3) individual integrator and (4) cross-functional team. R&D–production integration in the case-projects was characterized by the use of a portfolio of the four mechanisms. The case-studies suggest a number of management challenges related to the use of the above integration mechanisms. First, the organization of a cross-functional project planning process was found to be elementary. Second, in order to effectively support the planning process, the level of detail and timeliness of the NPD-process descriptions should be carefully managed. Third, concerning the individual integrator and cross-functional team, the case-studies highlight the importance of ensuring early production resources by focusing the product development effort, by distinguishing between operational activities and NPD, and by carefully balancing the recruiting between R&D and production.}

However, the mapping relationship between this kind of effect expectation requirement and product design knowledge is difficult to explore and establish, and it is more difficult to guide designing process objectively. In order to expand product conceptual design ideas, professionally search the design solution space, and improve user satisfaction, this article proposes product design knowledge and engineering parameter mapping technologies that support conceptual design: First, construct a domain knowledge graph based on patent text. Extract entities-such as effect knowledge, functional knowledge, technical knowledge, and structural knowledge-and inter-entity relationships from patent texts through BERT technology to realize the construction of domain knowledge graph; Second, in view of the fuzziness and incompleteness of the front stage design requirements, by introducing General Engineering Parameters (GEPs), construct the domain product-engineering parameter-structure (PGS) mapping relationship library. On the one hand, the library realizes the professional representation and completion of the product design requirements from the engineering perspective; on the other hand, it improves the mapping relationship between the difficult-to-identify relationships between design requirements and their structural solutions in the domain knowledge graph; Third, a product conceptual design process model based on PGS is proposed. The model takes the professional and complete requirements expressed as engineering parameters as input, which matches patent candidate sets through effect knowledge in the domain knowledge graph. Then select and construct a structural solution morphology matrix through computational evaluation methods to support the generation of product design conceptions; Finally, an example of manipulator design verifies the effectiveness of the knowledge library and the technical solution proposed by this research.}

abstract = {Currently, new product concepts are often evaluated by developing detailed virtual part and assembly models with traditional computer aided design (CAD) tools followed by appropriate analyses (e.g., finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, etc.). The creation of these models and analyses are tremendously time consuming. If a number of different conceptual configurations have been determined, it may not be possible to model and analyze each of them due to the complexity of these evaluation processes. Thus, promising concepts might be eliminated based solely on insufficient time and resources for assessment. In addition, the virtual models and analyses performed are usually of much higher detail and accuracy than what is needed for such early assessment. By eliminating the time-consuming complexity of a CAD environment and incorporating qualitative assessment tools, engineers could spend more time evaluating concepts that may have been previously abandoned due to time constraints. To address these issues, the Advanced Systems Design Suite (ASDS), was created. The ASDS incorporates a PC user interface with an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment to ease the creation and assessment of conceptual design prototypes individually or collaboratively in an immersive VR environment. Assessment tools incorporate metamodeling approximations and immersive visualization to evaluate the feasibility of each concept. In this paper, the ASDS system and interface along with specifically designed immersive VR assessment tools such as state saving and dynamic viewpoint creation are presented for conceptual large vehicle design. A test case example of redesigning an airplane is presented to explore the feasibility of the proposed system.}

We followed three innovation networks over a three-year period and examined how they successfully used information systems (IS) to respond to these challenges. On the basis of their experiences we identify IS categories and measures that support setting up an information management for networked innovation.
