abstract = {Symmetry plays a double role in modern particle physics. As global internal symmetry, it gives structure to the wealth of experimental data concerning quarks and leptons. As gauged internal symmetry, it fixes the dynamical content of three of the four basic interactions in nature: electromagnetic, strong and weak. In electromagnetism, the one global internal symmetry is that of “electric charge,” and its gauging led—by 1950—to the highly successful (Abelian) U(1) gauge theory of electromagnetism—quantum electrodynamics (or QED for short). It took several more decades to identify the correct global internal symmetries in the strong and weak interactions to be gauged. For the strong interaction (among the quarks) the gauging of the three “color” internal degrees of freedom associated with each quark produced the phenomenologically correct (non-Abelian) SU(3) color gauge theory of the strong interaction—quantum chromodynamics (or QCD for short). For the weak interaction (among quarks and leptons) the proper choice was the seven chiral quark and lepton flavors in each generation and their gauging gave rise to the equally successful (non-Abelian) SU(2) × U(1) dynamical theory of the electroweak interaction—quantum flavordynamics (or QFD for short). The remarkable triumphs of the gauge theories of QED, QCD and QFD are testimony to the power of the old Einsteinian dictum: “symmetry dictates dynamics.”}

abstract = {In liquid metal (LM) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows in the access ducts of a breeding blanket of a fusion power reactor, the spatially varying fringing magnetic field can be responsible for high MHD pressure drop, which is one of the blanket feasibility issues. In this study, the velocity field and the pressure drop of the LM MHD flow in a square non-conducting duct have been characterized via numerical computations with COMSOL Multiphysics for the case of a non-uniform magnetic field that decreases in the flow direction. In the computations, four configurations of the fringing magnetic field varying in magnetic field gradient and a wide range of Hartmann (1000<Ha<10,000) and Reynolds (1000<Re<10,000) numbers have been employed. A total of 80 cases were computed providing a database for construction of a pressure drop correlation. The obtained correlation relates the pressure drop coefficient k to Ha, Re and the magnetic field gradient with a high accuracy with the coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.9967. Detailed analysis has been performed on the effect of the flow parameters and the magnetic field gradient on the recirculation flow bubble, which was found to form in the flow in most of the computed cases due to strong 3D MHD effects caused by the magnetic field gradient. Strong inertia effects have been found at higher Re and lower Ha numbers by comparing computed results between full and inertialess flow models.}

abstract = {Extant literature on sustainability in procurement and supplier selection suffers from a number of deficiencies. First, studies pertaining to the dynamic nature of stakeholders’ expectations of sustainability and its impact on determining a supply portfolio have not been studied before. Second, there is a genuine lack of study linking the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements, firm procurement strategies, and eventual supplier selection. Third, most of the existing studies address sustainability issues in procurement and supplier selection but fall short of determining an optimal portfolio of suppliers and corresponding optimal order quantities. This study addresses the above research gaps by developing a sustainability-focused multi-criteria decision model for supplier evaluation and determining optimal order allocation among the suppliers linking the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements and firm procurement strategies. Based on dynamic capability theory, we develop a decision support framework integrating multi-phased quality function deployment and dynamic optimization. We apply the decision support framework to a European apparel company which sources apparel from Bangladesh: a country that is a low cost sourcing destination. First, this study identifies the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements. It then explicates the company’s procurement strategies in terms of stakeholders’ requirements followed by translating the procurement strategies to relevant supplier assessment criteria. Finally, a linear optimization model is developed to maximize the suppliers’ sustainability performance in order to determine the optimal supply portfolio. The results identify two distinct groups of suppliers satisfying the overall sustainability performance. However the optimal order quantities among the suppliers vary randomly depending on the variations in demand and priority weights of the suppliers. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the results and implications.}

The authors are conducting research on the application of support systems in engineering (CDSS) to methodologies that support design (conceptual design) in the information systems field. Based on the results of applying CDSS to the digital field, this paper defines a new CDSS methodology that incorporates new "storytelling" and "digital business strategy" in the problem understanding phase to derive solutions to human and economic requirements.

The design requirements of S/H-UAVs were analyzed firstly. The proposed process used Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) to establish logical and quantitative standards. Moreover, in order to appropriately describe the hesitancy of experts while making decision, it used Q-Rung Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (QRDHFS) to score the correlationships. In addition, a decision-making framework is proposed to perform a logical selection of typical layouts based on defuzzification method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The present process has been applied for S/H-UAVs. The resulting set of design requirements consists of three categories: Mission Requirements (MRs), Engineering Characteristics (ECs) and Technical Indicators (TIs). Four typical layouts of S/H-UAVs were sorted and determined. The performance of four typical layouts were evaluated and the Strut-Braced Wing (SBW) with external hydrogen storage was selected as the best layout for S/H-UAVs.}

abstract = {Understanding the reasons of process variation is recognised as a key to the successful management of business processes. Various exploration methods give the prospective users a chance to tackle such complex problems by means of computer. This paper considers two key methodologies within the domain of exploration methods: simulation modelling and value analysis (VA). With worked-out examples, this paper shows, by using the techniques adopted from traditional manufacturing process control, how this problem can be tackled. For retrospective studies focusing to understand and manage internal process variation, statistical process control (SPC) charts together with the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) method is a powerful tool. For prospective studies, focusing to understand and manage the effects due to variability of customer needs, information generated in quality function deployment (QFD) analysis is suggested to be used. All information generated by studies can be used in simulations using Taguchi cross-product redesigns. When the object of VA is a business process instead of a product, the paper also describes how these methods can be applied to business process re-engineering (BPR). The creative problem solving power of VA is especially helpful in BPR. The small improvements can be achieved via the logical analysis and modelling methods but the radical breakthrough improvements require often creative problem solving in addition to modelling. Application of the methods is exposed through a business process example of Neste Advanced Power Systems Finland solar power systems manufacturing, using IDEFO models to be translated for simulation via coloured Petri nets. The conclusion of the paper is that the joined methodology offers a practical advantage for managing simulation studies needed in business process redesign.}

We first forecast the total carbon emissions in 2030 for each city, state, and major industry in Hunan Province through a scenario and then innovatively use the mass function allocation theory in marketing to sort out the logical ideas of the optimization model. More importantly, we combine the zero-sum game theory to build the zero-sum game-data envelopment analysis model to continuously reallocate the carbon emission allowances of each city and state and major industries in Hunan Province until the optimal allocation scheme is reached. From the perspective of each city and state, the initial carbon emission efficiency level of fourteen cities in Hunan is high, but there are still some differences. From the perspective of industries, the initial efficiency of carbon emission of six major industries in Hunan is lower, and the difference in efficiency values is evident.}

abstract = {The universal adaptive strategy theory (UAST) describes how the ecological strategy of plants changes along the succession after disturbance. However, whether it applies to those off-peak successional pathways in extremely heterogeneous forests is uncertain. This study established a series of forest dynamic plots along the natural regeneration in subtropical karst forests, and aimed to verify whether UAST applied to the succession in extremely heterogeneous forests. By measuring the dominant plant functional traits (PFTs) and quantifying the plant ecological strategy spectrum, we found that the PFTs varied significantly along the natural regeneration, as did plant ecological strategies. Further results showed that the C- and S-strategy dominated the community-level ecological strategy spectrum. In addition, the C-strategy gradually increased along the natural regeneration, while the S-strategy exhibited a decreasing trend. The community spatial structure and abiotic factors including soil physicochemical properties and topographic factors jointly drove the ecological strategy spectrum of the plant community, with the community spatial structure playing a more important role. This study provided clear evidence to support Grime’s CSR theory and the UAST, which emphasized the abiotic stress conditions supported the S-strategy plants, while the C-strategy would dominate in relative fertile soil conditions.}

However, design assessment in the early stage of residential design is a complex problem due to multifactor coupling, the diversity in user needs, and the incompleteness of design knowledge. This study proposes an integrated framework of knowledge-based decision support system (KBDSS) to mitigate such problems. In this framework, the user segmentation is performed in accordance with people’s particular requirements priority and, thus, enables design decisions that create better satisfaction among a wider audience. Meanwhile, the quality function deployment approach, decision support system, and fuzzy set theory are used to translate user requirements into quantifiable design specifications, thereby making the design a multicriteria decision-making problem. To illustrate and validate the proposed framework, a case study of a KBDSS for a multiunit residential building kitchen design is demonstrated to explore a user-centered residential design with such decision support. This proposed framework provides naive design practitioners with specific knowledge about decision problems and assists them in consistently making user-centered design decisions. The research results represent a further step toward a systematic methodology of user-centered built environment design.}

In competitive business circumstances, management continually asks: (1) How flexible must the firm be in investing in IT in order to meet unknown business needs in the future? At the same time, how efficient must the firm be in order to meet current business needs?; (2) How well must the firm align its business strategy with IT investment in order for it to support its strategic goals?; (3) how to construct a decision path for IT investments with respect to flexibility, efficiency and alignment between business strategy and IT investments? Although many researchers have struggled to answer these questions, they generally provide no means for incorporating these factors into the IT investment decision process. This paper suggests a method that identifies the degree of flexibility required (α-value), and accounts for and incorporates the α-value in making IT investments.

Futuristic airport designs will be innovative in achieving sustainable development practices such as clean and affordable energy, protection of natural resources, waste reduction, natural features and green space around an airport, sustainable transportation system, natural storm water management of airports, etc. In classical Quality Function Deployment, crisp numbers are used to determine the priorities of the passenger requirements, design requirements, and their relationship matrix to evaluate airport quality. However, vagueness and impreciseness are inevitable uncertainties in those kinds of human judgments, which are generally realized by linguistic terms, and traditional Quality Function Deployment is not associated with “sustainability.” The main contribution of this paper is to present a new approach that integrates Hesitant Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis and Hesitant Fuzzy Sustainable Quality Function Deployment method to enhance the sustainable airport quality. Hesitant fuzzy set theory reflects the hesitancy in human nature while making a decision to the fuzzy numbers, compared to other fuzzy set theories, such as traditional fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, etc. In this study, the importance degrees of sustainable passenger requirements were evaluated by considering Hesitant Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis in the first stage of Hesitant Fuzzy Sustainable Quality Function Deployment method. Then sustainable design requirement was prioritized to develop the sustainable quality management of the airport. Finally, a case study concerning the sustainable development of the airport was used to elucidate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed framework. The results obtained from the case study showed that Hesitant Fuzzy Sustainable Quality Function Deployment could be a practical and structural methodology in the early planning stage of a sustainable airport design.}

This data is plentiful and often designers lack the knowledge with satisfying accuracy. This paper suggests a machine learning approach in which a neural network automatically determines the data by learning from examples. Unlike conventional neural networks which are treated as black boxes, the topology and the weight values are not random but represent real circumstances and can directly be interpreted in the terms of the application.

Within the R&D organization, information must flow into and among numerous teams. This network of interpersonal communications can go a long way toward determining the success of a company's innovation efforts. In an exploratory study of a Belgian company operating in the telecommunications industry, Rudy K. Moenaert and Filip Caeldries examine the effects of interpersonal communication on market and technological learning in R&D. Trying to improve the flow of information into and within its R&D organization, this company designed its new R&D facility with an eye toward improving both market and technological learning throughout the organization. By locating R&D personnel in closer proximity to one another, management hoped to provide them with improved access to market and technological information, and thus increase their innovativeness. Contrary to expectations, placing R&D professionals in closer proximity to one another did not increase technological learning in this organization. In fact, technological learning actually decreased slightly during the period studied, though the change is not statistically significant. On the other hand, market learning and product innovativeness improved significantly during the period studied. For an R&D professional in this company, members of other R&D teams seem to be more important as sources of market information than as sources of technological information. Surprisingly, the relocation of R&D personnel also did not increase the amount of communication that takes place, either within a project team, between members of different teams, or between R&D professionals and the management steering committee. However, the architectural redesign does appear to have improved the quality of communication. R&D team leaders report that since the relocation, the information flowing into R&D has been more customer focused. This is attributed to the company's ongoing efforts to provide the tools and structures necessary for supporting the objectives of the architectural redesign. For example, implementation of quality function deployment (QFD) has helped innovation team members to focus more clearly on relevant information. The success of the architectural design required approaching this effort as a complex, ongoing process, rather than a quick-fix solution.}

abstract = {With the gradual diversification of personalized usage scenarios, user requirements play a direct role in product design decisions. Due to the problem of fuzzy demand caused by user cognitive bias, traditional design methods usually focus on realizing product functions and cannot effectively match user requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a complex product module division method for user requirements. The method constitutes of three tasks, requirement analysis of module division, design mapping of module division and scheme implementation of module division. Firstly, based on the progressive architecture from initial requirements to precise requirements, the effective user requirements are obtained through similarity recommendation. Secondly, according to the four types of knowledge of function, geometry, physics and design, the design structure matrix is constructed to complete the Requirement-Function-Structure mapping. The improved Fuzzy C-means Algorithm is used to solve the mapping model, and finally a module division scheme that meets the user requirements is obtained. Taking the chip removal machine as an example, the rationality and effectiveness of the method are verified. The results show that the product modules divided by this method can effectively meet the multiple user requirements.}

However, traditional ecodesign approaches in product redesign often focus on modifying hotspots that may not always reflect the improvement potential or align with the designers' controllable design variables. To optimize ecodesign efforts, this study emphasizes the importance of targeting design variables that exert the most significant environmental sustainability influence on the product. To facilitate such targeted design efforts, an influence assessment was developed to evaluate the environmental sustainability impact of design variables using a four-step framework that adapts Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA). The framework was demonstrated through two redesign scenarios of a handheld fan considering the design tri-factor (choice of material, manufacturing process, and design geometry). In scenario 1, where only the handheld fan's stand was considered, design geometry was identified as the most influential factor in the component's environmental sustainability. In scenario 2, involving four components required to be fabricated from the same material, the material choice was collectively found to exert the greatest influence, even though the stand and battery cover showed alternative design variables with higher influence individually. In both scenarios, the designs generated based on the most influential design variable yielded the lowest carbon emissions among the modifications generated. These results underscore the framework's potential to guide designers towards more effective and sustainable product redesigns.}

In order to reduce the influence of user requirement ambiguity on design results in the product design process and improve the accuracy of user requirements in the function-behavior-structure (FBS) design model, this paper proposes an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy set-based FBS model integrating AHP and HOQ methods. Firstly, the design model will use IVPF-AHP method to study user requirements and use interval-valued Pythagorean linguistic terms to replace the traditional scoring method of AHP to get the weight of each user requirement. Secondly, the conversion between user requirements and functions will be realized by IVPF-HOQ method, which converts customer requirements into functional characteristics and calculates the weights of each functional characteristic. Finally, the design focus will be filtered according to the order of importance of the functional characteristics, which will be used as functions to guide the development of the FBS model. In this paper, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method will be verified by an application example of a hand-held fluorescence spectrometer. The results show that the proposed FBS model can effectively reduce the subjectivity and ambiguity in the decision-making process, improve the accuracy and information richness of user requirements, and effectively highlight the focus of the design study. The innovation of the proposed method is to provide a more objective and accurate innovative design method for user requirements through the integration of AHP, HOQ and FBS to effectively explore and analyze user requirements. The use of IVPFS to deal with fuzzy information in the design process in a more flexible manner can reduce the ambiguity of requirements when user data is small, and effectively improve the limitations of the FBS design model which is more subjective.}

abstract = {In mass customization, companies have built product families to enhance design efficiency and meet customer requirements. However, the complex and diverse customer requirements make the traditional process of mapping customer needs to product families challenging and heavily reliant on prior knowledge. To address this challenge, the mapping task is treated as a classification problem, with customer requirements as classification features and product families as category labels. Based on information theory, this study considers the information gain (IG) and mutual information (MI) between the classification features and the labels. The uncertainty relationship between the two is explored using grey relational analysis (GRA). A hybrid weighting matrix is constructed by combining the effects of these three aspects, which is then used to improve the calculation of the classical support vector machine (CSVM) kernel function, forming a multi-information fusion weighted support vector machine (MIFWSVM) model. This model can take new requirements as input and output product variants that may satisfy the customer. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study of a mechanical press company was reported, comparing the MIFWSVM model with classical classifiers and exploring the impact of different weighting methods on the performance of CSVM. The MIFWSVM model achieved an average accuracy of 0.9205 with a standard deviation of 0.0506 and a macro F1 score of 0.9032 with a standard deviation of 0.0589, outperforming other methods. These results indicate that the MIFWSVM model significantly improves the accuracy and stability of customer demand mapping.}

Four experimental diets were formulated to be iso-proteinic (50 %), iso-lipidic (19 %), and iso-energetic (22 MJ/kg), with FM replaced by SCM at rates of 0 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % (SM0, SM50, SM75, and SM100, respectively). These were manufactured and tested on 240 fish with an initial average weight of 82.61 ± 1.40 g. The growth performance of sea bass significantly improved with the replacement of FM with SCM. Fish fed the SM50 diet exhibited the highest weight gain (96.24 g compared to 63.85 g for the SM0 control diet), and the best specific growth rate (SGR) was observed in fish fed the SM50 diet, followed by those fed the SM75 diet. Conversely, fish fed the SM100 diet demonstrated similar weight gain (WG) and SGR as those fed the SM0 control diet. The best feed conversion rate (FCR) was recorded in fish fed the SM50 diet (1.42 compared to 1.76 for those fed the SM0 control diet). The findings revealed that replacing 50 % FM with SCM considerably enhanced the zootechnical performance while maintaining the analytical composition of the whole fish and intestinal microflora. Furthermore, replacing 50 % of FM in the experimental diets significantly enhanced the environmental and economic sustainability indices. The environmental sustainability index was considerably reduced with the use of SCM (fish-in fish-out (FIFO) ≤ 1) and had a favorable economic impact, reducing feed costs by 24.3 % ($0.84/kg compared to $1.11/kg for the SM0 control diet), and saving 38.9 % on the cost of converting feed into fish biomass ($1.19/kg compared to $1.95/kg in the SM0 control diet).}

These emissions originate from different sectors however, one of the major contributions comes from the transportation sector. In order to tackle this problem, greener modes of transportation like Electric Vehicles (EV) are introduced as an alternative option. Currently, different types of EVs are available in the market, with Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) being the most popular type of EV in developing countries. Nevertheless, a lot of customers are still preferring Conventional Vehicles (CV) over EVs, which is inevitably damaging the market share of EVs and creating problems in their wider acceptance. Thus, the aim of this study is to solve two problems. First, to identify the factors which make CVs more appealing to the customers. Secondly, how these shortcomings can be overcome for HEVs. For this purpose, the relationship of different parameters with CVs is evaluated using the multiple regression method, which is then incorporated into the Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) model to find the best solution for adding those parameters to HEVs. The analysis resulted in the identification of affordability, reliability, variety and fuel consumption as the key contributors that made CVs, a more attractive option to the customers. Furthermore, local manufacturing was identified as the best solution for improving the quality of HEVs and make them market competitive in developing countries. The practical applications of this research, along with the contextual analysis of the developing countries are the principal novelties of the study.}

However, researches seldom focused on determination of criteria weights, although they were also important components for FMCDM. In fact, criteria weights can be computed through extending quality function deployment (QFD) under fuzzy environment, i.e. fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD). By FQFD, customer demanded qualities expressing the opinions of customers and service development capabilities presenting the opinions of experts can be integrated into criteria weights for FMCDM. However, deriving criteria weights in FQFD may be complex and different to multiply two fuzzy numbers in real world. To resolve the tie, we will combine FQFD with relative preference relation on FMCDM problems. With the relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers, it is not necessary multiplying two fuzzy numbers to derive criteria weights in FQFD. Alternatively, adjusted criteria weights will substitute for original criteria weights through relative preference relation. Obviously, adjusted criteria weights are clearly determined and then utilized in FMCDM models.}

Quantity (Q), frequency (F), and duration (D) of cocaine use during a person’s heaviest use period are important aspects of cocaine use patterns that associated with cocaine use disorder (CocUD).
Methods
A total 2988 lifetime cocaine users who met CocUD after the onset of cocaine heaviest use were identified from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III). QFD were each categorized into four levels. Hierarchical regressions were used to examine the association between QFD of cocaine use and CocUD. Two-way interactions between QFD were also examined.
Results
As the level of cocaine use increased from low to very high, the prevalence of CocUD increased. Compared to people with low F, cocaine users with very high F were 12.09 times (95 %CI 6.33, 23.07) as likely to meet criteria for CocUD. Similarly, Q was associated with 4.84 (95 %CI 2.55, 9.18) times the risk of CocUD. D was not significantly associated with the risk of CocUD. Significant additive interaction was identified between Q*F on CocUD prevalence. Approximately one-third of the excess risk associated with having high Q & high F was due to the interactive effect.
Conclusion
Of these three cocaine use patterns, F had the strongest association with CocUD, followed by the Q. High Q and high F was a very dangerous pattern of cocaine use as the combination had as a synergistic effect on the risk of CocUD. It is important for intervention programs to focus on the reduction of both Q and F.}

Although maritime logistics resilience (MLR) has garnered growing attention, the field still lacks a unified theoretical framework and standardized evaluation indicator system, exposing a significant research gap. This study seeks to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of 163 papers from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, covering the period from 2009 to August 2023. The study defines maritime logistics resilience, identifies its four key attributes—robustness, vulnerability, redundancy, and rapidity—and explores their interrelationships, establishing a theoretical framework. Based on this foundation, an innovative evaluation indicator system is proposed for the first time, designed to assess resilience across the three main clusters of the maritime logistics system: ports, shipping networks, and the maritime supply chain. The proposed framework and indicator system provide a novel, comprehensive approach to evaluating MLR, offering both theoretical contributions and practical tools for industry practitioners. This research fills a critical gap in the field and lays the groundwork for future empirical studies and policy development.}

abstract = {In these days, when the concepts of sustainability and circular economy are extremely prevalent, the most critical issue to be addressed is food. Since food is a basic need, circular economy practices have become extremely important, especially in food packaging. Not only the robustness or minimization of the package, but also the fact that the material used can be evaluated within the scope of circular economy ensures that food packaging is sustainable. Therefore, the first aim is to investigate the impact of food packaging design on sustainability. Moreover, to determine the relationship between circularity and food packaging design, and to minimize the conflicting food packaging design characteristics against sustainability by circular design are other aims of this study. With this aim, Quality Function Deployment method is applied for 29 consumer expectations about circular food packaging design (What's) and 34 technical requirements for these expectations for circular food packaging design (How's). The novelty of this study, since food packaging design is a newly discussed topic, it is important to consider the customer and technical expectations together in terms of circularity and sustainability. As a result, the most important consumer expectations are determined and relationship is presented with technical requirements each other. It is expected that this study will be beneficial for managers and practitioners.}

abstract = {Customer-driven product design process is critically an important part of concurrent engineering (CE). Many new principles and approaches, such as quality function deployment (QFD) and axiomatic design, have been introduced to help designers identify the relationship between customer requirements and design characteristics. However, identification of customer requirements and evaluation of design alternatives are still heavily reliant on designer's experience and knowledge. This will affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the customer-driven design process and even make the development of design automation become more difficult. This paper presents a framework that integrates the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to assist designers in identifying customer requirements and design characteristics, and help achieve an effective evaluation of the final design solution. The proposed approach starts with applying the AHP method to evaluate the relative overall importance of customer requirements and design characteristics. The TOPSIS method is then used to perform competitive benchmarking. Finally, a search strategy is employed to set target values for design characteristics of the recommended design alternative. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated and validated using a personal digital assistant (PDA) design example. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of helping designers to systematically consider relevant design information and effectively determine the key design objectives and optimal conceptual alternatives.}

abstract = {The contribution of agriculture to the welfare of society is determined by its economic, social and environmental performance. Although theoretical discussions can be found in the literature, few reports exist that integrate the social demand for multifunctional agriculture in the evaluation of the sustainability and the global welfare of society. This paper presents a methodology that combines economic valuation, integrated modelling, stakeholder analysis, and multi-criteria evaluation. It consists of three steps to determine: (1) social demands for multifunctional agriculture; (2) feasible technical alternatives available from the supply part of the market; (3) the net utility of alternatives for society measured as the change in social net benefit, i.e. the sum of changes compared to the current situation expressed in utility of market and non-market net benefits. Market net benefits are represented by their monetary value. Quality Function Deployment combined with Analytic Network Process (QFD/ANP) were used to estimate the non-market net benefits. The methodology is applied to the case study of a dairy-farming based agricultural landscape in the Northern Friesian Woodlands, The Netherlands. Social net benefit depended on land use, i.e. pasture management regimes on each of the agricultural fields and on presence or absence of hedgerows around the fields. Changes in market net utility were expressed in terms of changes for farmers, consumers and government. Changes in non-market net utility were expressed in terms of changes in landscape quality, nature value and environmental health for Dutch society as a whole, as estimated from European public surveys (Eurobarometer). The complete solution space defined by the market and non-market net benefits of landscapes with alternative patterns of land use was estimated to offer insight in the trade-off between market and non-market performance and enable selection of ‘icon’ landscapes to target or avoid. Improvement of the current landscape towards the social optimum would involve changes in pasture management resulting in higher gross margin for farmers, slightly relaxing current environmental restrictions, which could be reached at lower levels of subsidies in agri-environmental programs. In addition to such overall optimum the results demonstrate the trade-off between market and non-market benefits and the characteristics of current, utopian and dystopian landscapes. The approach provides an alternative to current economic valuation methods which focus on assessment of economic value as an input to analysis. Here, economic value emerges as the trade-off between market and non-market functions which is an output of the analysis.}

abstract = {With the increasing public awareness of packaging and the environmental impact caused by it, companies are driving their businesses to introduce and promote practices that help ease the negative impact of packaging on the environment. Studies done on consumer behaviour show that decisions nowadays are influenced by sustainability. Yet, companies struggle with changing practices and justifying adopting environmentally friendly packaging materials. The current paper presents a holistic approach, addressing the need for identifying, assessing, and selecting sustainable materials for packaging applications. The Kano model prioritises features that are then used with Ashby plots for identifying alternative materials. Life cycle assessment, as well as life cycle costing, are used for assessing the environmental and financial impact of the use of such materials. Automatically weighted Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Analysis (MCDA) is used to select the most appropriate packaging material. This methodology provides a combinatorial ranking for each criterion set by four pre-defined weight distributions for Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The proposed methodology allows for a systematic and holistic design process when deciding on packaging materials for any product. The methodology is validated for the case of packaging weather-sensitive cast stone products and carbonated drinks. In cast stone, three packaging materials are ranked for pallets based on their attributes. Similarly, for carbonated drinks, three packaging materials are recommended at the end of the study.}

The second fold introduces a new customer-oriented method, termed FAQT-2, for group-MCDM by improving and extending an existing method termed FAQT. Three new stages are integrated. A preliminary stage is assigned to manage the information flow to/from the consultation team. An intermediate stage is assigned to construct the final decision matrix. A post-analysis stage is assigned to verify, report, and revise the obtained solution. This represents the main novelty of the study. Thus, the decision maker can obtain a feedback report on the rationality of the final weights, trade-offs between the alternatives, and the individual effect of alternatives and customer’s requirements on the solution. This supports reinstalling the inputs if any inappropriateness arises. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are considered to study the effect of changes in customer’s expectations. The developed method is framed in a C# code software for use in research and industry. The third fold implements a case study and discusses the results, which approved the capability of FAQT-2 to improve the selection decisions.}

abstract = {It is crucial to define product specifications (a series of engineering characteristics and their corresponding values) reasonably and scientifically in the early phases of product development. The product specifications should consider multiple decision-making factors (external situations, internal situations, laws and regulations, and other product lifecycle requirements), which requires several cycles of iterations, tradeoffs, and modifications. During this decision-making process, two key challenges must be overcome. The first is how to organize all of the related factors in a manner that adequately assists, clarifies, and expresses the iterative decision-making process. The second is how to abstract this decision-making problem with iterations and tradeoffs into an approximate optimization model. To overcome these two challenges, a bilevel-optimization approach to determine product specifications during the product planning and concept design phases is proposed. First, an iterative decision-making process, which includes customer value-driven product planning based on quality function deployment, design risk-reducing concept design using cost-based concept failure mode effects analysis, and the interactions between the product planning and concept design phases, is constructed to solve the first challenge. Second, a bilevel-optimization model is proposed to determine the best product specifications and product concepts, which clarifies how the tradeoffs between these two phases are reached, solving the second challenge. Subsequently, a case study of developing an integrated washer and dryer machine is used to explain and prove the validity of the proposed bilevel-optimization approach.}

This paper describes a systematic method similar to quality function deployment (QFD) methods for carrying out these process steps. The feasibility (time and costs) of the rapid prototyping (RP) application depends to a large extent on the correct decision but also on the nature and quality of the product data given to the contract suppliers. The designer must therefore be in a position to evaluate the RP-specific quality of his design and to provide the supplier with optimized data. Product development costs can be effectively reduced by employing a neutral test environment to verify the GPP suitability of the generated product data.}

abstract = {This study hybridizes the Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) and Evidential Reasoning (ER) approaches to prioritize the Transportation Design (TDs) based on Transportation Requirements (TRs) in Road High-demand Public Transportation (RHDPT). This six-step approach identifies the TRs and their Trapezoidal Weights (TWs) using the FQFD approach and based on Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) assigned by decision-makers. The second step identifies the TDs based on TRs aided to the FQFD approach. In the third step, the relation matrix between TDs and TRs is configured. Then, the fuzzy interaction weights of TDs are calculated, where TFNs consider the fulfillment of each one of the TDs on TRs. The output of the mentioned step is the Interaction Trapezoidal Weights (ITWs) of the TDs. Finally, the fourth step calculates the TWs of TDs. At the fifth step, we configure the Belief Structure (BS) of ER in order to convert the TWs of TDs to BS of ER. In fact, this step converts the output of the FQFD approach to input on ER. Finally, the priority of TDs is calculated based on the upper and lower bounds of expected values of TDs. Moreover, the superiority of TDs over each other is calculated. This paper not only smooths the chaos and ambiguity aspects of decision makers’ opinions via an efficient Lemma, but it also considers the weights of decision-makers, along with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. A case study is implemented for the prioritization of TDs in Arba'een event as an RHDPT. The case study results and sensitivity analyses showed the excellent performance of our hybrid FQFD-ER approach to prioritize the TDs in RHDPT.}

Rigor and discipline during the later phases of system design (preliminary and detail) cannot compensate for an ill-conceived concept and for premature commitments made during the conceptual design phase. Its significance notwithstanding, conceptual design analysis and evaluation has been largely ignored by the research and development community. This paper addresses the feasibility of system reliability during the conceptual design analysis and evaluation process. Feasibility assessment involves compliance analysis (versus separation or ranking analysis) between the required and predicted values of the reliability parameter. A fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) mechanism is applied for the delineation of a fuzzy target or required value of system reliability. Thereafter, system reliability is predicted or estimated for each potential system design concept. These predictions and estimations may be expressed as fuzzy or stochastic measures. More often than not, however, the resolution and extent of information available during conceptual design may only allow fuzzy estimations and predictions. This paper presents the development of a weighted wedge to facilitate compliance analysis between fuzzy required and predicted system reliability values.}

The pH and soluble solids were similar among the three beverages and did not change after heat treatments. The content of cyanidin-3-malonyl-glucoside, a polyphenol, significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by 35–45% with the hot-fill process in all beverage prototypes. Turbidity was not significantly affected by the type of heat treatment, but the viscosity of the hot-filled beverages was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the pasteurized and non-pasteurized prototypes. No significant differences (p < 0.05) in color parameters L*, a*, and b* were observed. Total color difference (DE*) values indicated differences in perceivable color among samples of the same beverage exposed to the heat processing regimes. DE* values for prototype 1 processed by pasteurization and commercial sterilization were distinct from non-pasteurized beverage. DE* values for prototypes 2 and 3 processed by pasteurization were distinct from those of the non-pasteurized beverage. Pasteurization allowed higher retention of bioactive compounds and had a lower impact on the physicochemical properties of the blackberry-soy-flaxseed beverage.}

A Swedish SME building company was investigated from the viewpoint of customer orientation, production and design of multi-storey timber frame houses. The company uses industrial fabrication of volumes. The aim was to analyse how the production can benefit from an integration of a customer-oriented design and production. First, a model based on the QFD method is proposed on how requirements from customers, i.e., tenants, can be taken into account in the design process and how CE can be adapted to a SME design process. Second, a preliminary model is proposed considering disturbances and relative cost effects on the production due to changes in the design solutions. The presented model aims to predict the total cost for a customer affected design on the used building system to forecast the costs for the main contractor and building owner for a similar integrated design in the future. All observations are based on case studies of the design process and the industrialised production of a three-storey timber frame house with three different floor designs.}

The helmet must be designed to provide the user with the most lightweight, formfitting system, while meeting other system performance requirements. This can be achieved through a complete analysis of the system requirements. One such technique for systems analysis, a quality function deployment (QFD) matrix, is explored for this purpose. The outcome of the QFD matrix would then be utilized in the advanced helmet development process. The advanced helmet development process for developing aircrew helmets includes the use of several emerging technologies, such as laser scanning, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-generated patterns from 3D surfaces, laser cutting of patterns and components, and rapid prototyping (stereolithography). Advanced anthropometry methods for helmet development are also available. Besides the application of advanced technologies to the development of helmet assemblies, methods of mass reduction are also discussed. The use of these advanced technologies will minimize errors in the development cycle of the helmet and moulds, and should enhance system performance while reducing development time and cost.}

abstract = {Vertical fuel structure is critical for fire hazard assessment in forest ecosystems. Forest stands with ladder fuels are more prone to crown fires because of canopy fuel continuity. However, characterization of ladder fuels is difficult in the field and few studies have developed explicit measurement procedures to account for these hazardous fuel situations. This study compares vertical profiles derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and stereoscopic hemispherical images obtained in Pinus sylvestris stands in central Spain to test their ability to detect the presence or absence of vertical fuel continuity (VFC). Vertical fuel profiles based on canopy cover fraction estimations at different height strata were assessed at plot level and compared with field observations. The quadratic form distance (QFD) was the metric used to quantify the similarity between histogram distributions defined by the vertical profiles from different datasets. Logistic regression analysis was tested to discriminate areas with and without VFC from ALS data at two threshold levels (15% and 30%). The vertical fuel profiles of canopy cover showed a different level of correspondence depending on the relative amount of ladder fuels. Significant logistic models were found (p < 0.0001, c-index>090) for different combination of ALS metrics, with low percentiles (up to P30), canopy relief ratio (CRR) and the percentage of returns normalized by height strata (PRN) up to 8 m as the best predictors to identify the presence of VFC. Results indicated that both datasets were useful in retrieving variability of forest fuel distribution, but further methodological improvements (e.g. understory segmentation in stereoscopic images, new algorithms to better account for occlusions, or ground calibration for laser attenuation in ALS) are needed to increase accuracy in highly continuous areas.}

This integrated approach helped in identifying safety interventions, which added a new dimension to the safety intervention design in the operational study at the workplace. By observing the effectiveness of the immersive safety training in identifying the accident path elements such as hazards and initiating mechanisms, a three-dimensional (3D) VR environment is created for safety training of Electric Overhead Travelling (EOT) crane operators of the studied manufacturing industry. This study is carried out in two phases based on accident path elements identified before and after safety training in the VR platform. Three House of Safety (HoSs) are used in this study to establish a relationship between tasks and hazards, hazards and initiating mechanism, and initiating mechanism and safety interventions. Priority weight of interventions in the last HoS is fed as input to the capital budgeting methodology for the selection of an optimal number of interventions for safety improvement. 0–1 multi-dimensional knapsack model is used in capital budgeting considering safety budget and cost of each intervention. We have introduced Z- number approach in capital budgeting methodology to characterize the reliability of experts’ opinion considered in this process. A 15% improvement in safety performance is observed after safety training. Further, it is observed that technology-based interventions (laser scanner, smart helmet, smart jacket, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to monitor Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), immersive safety training) are having more weightage than traditional safety interventions after safety training.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing processes are inevitably associated with sustainable development. To unleash the potential of remanufacturing for circular economy transition, practitioners have introduced several strategies. Despite the important role of remanufacturing in circular economy, the final sales of remanufactured products are often less than anticipated targets. While several challenges may impact smaller sales, a primary challenge is a lack of focus on marketing strategies. Accordingly, only a small number of published studies explore marketing in the remanufacturing field. This study explores potential marketing opportunities in remanufacturing and focuses on improving warranty management; one approach is through increasing the reliability of quality by integrating smart technologies and, specifically, machine learning (ML). To achieve effective integration of machine learning in a new application, such as remanufacturing, more primary assessments are required. This study is the first to explore critical success factors (CSF) of machine learning with the integration of remanufacturing. A Danish case context has been chosen to explore the CSFs on machine learning integration in the quality process, especially with inspection of end-of-life (EoL) brake calipers. The study employs various theories, including CSF theory, Technology-Organization-Environment (ToE) theory, and stakeholder theory to analyze problem. 22 common CSFs were collected from existing studies, and they are validated and categorized based on ToE theory. The results show that 'expand the reach of algorithms' (T5), ‘scalability’ (O2), and ‘inspection policy’ (E2) are the most important success factors under these three dimensions, respectively. Several contributions were drawn from the results obtained that could directly help industrial leaders with the effective integration of ML in remanufacturing.}

Therefore, to make up for the shortcomings in the traditional coal mine safety management model, this paper introduces digital twin technology into coal mine safety management to achieve intelligent and efficient management of coal mine safety accidents. Firstly, we introduce the digital twin technology, select the five-dimensional model as the modeling basis, based on the existing twin model architecture, analyze the types of coal mine accidents and disasters, select the most destructive gas accidents as the research object, construct a twin safety management model for coal mine gas accidents using the digital twin five-dimensional model. Secondly, analyses of the actual operation mechanism of the digital twin model, and the advantages of the twin model in achieving prior prevention, rapid response and accurate control of gas incidents are pointed out. Finally, the house of quality of the gas accident digital twin model is established through the quality functional deployment tool, and key technical requirements for the construction of the twin model are given to accelerate the application of the gas accident twin model in the field.

The procedures may be adopted for passive or active solar still systems. The water level is optimized to be fixed as it shall reduce due to continuous evaporation if no automatic method is used. That will improve the performance of the solar still and increase its output yield. The design procedures considered customer needs which are surveyed and products specifications are decided. Design targets are specified using the quality function deployment. Three design alternatives are proposed and compared, and the best alternative is chosen based on the decision matrix. An auxiliary tank was added between the storage tank and the solar still with a ball valve to maintain a constant water level inside the auxiliary tank and a screw jack to control the elevation of the auxiliary tank and water level. Based on the hydrostatic principle, the elevation of the water level inside the auxiliary tank and solar still must be the same. Therefore, controlling the elevation of the water level inside the auxiliary tank using the screw jack controls the water depth inside the solar still. The proposed feedwater system can maintain the water level inside the solar still to its optimum value that improves the solar still productivity and convenience for the end-user.}

Common challenges associated with generation and evaluation of system functional architectures include search of the expansive design space and assessment of key performance attributes that are particularly “fuzzy” and qualitative in early architecture development. Several assessment approaches have been presented in the literature to address the assessment challenge to include Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Value-Focused Thinking (VFT), and fuzzy logic. In this research we combine the use of value functions and fuzzy assessment to assess a functional and system architecture. There are several benefits of a methodology that combines value-focused thinking and fuzzy assessment. A distinct advantage of the methodology presented is the explicit inclusion of the customer in the assessment process through validation of the TPM value functions Involving the customer in TPM value function development and validation ensures the customer has direct input regarding the TPMs and their associated value across the range of discourse The methodology presented is flexible enough to assess architectures early in the process when things are “fuzzy” as well as later when subsystem and component performance are well defined. The methodology can also be used to analyze and assess impacts of interface changes within the system architecture. . The methodology is domain independent and can be coupled with executable models linked to scenarios. The assessment methodology is applied to the architecture for a soldier knowledge acquisition system for which the key performance attributes are affordability, performance, flexibility, updateability, and availability.}

abstract = {Customer preference-involved product concept evaluation is a vital stage for developing new products. One of the key factors in this stage is to mine the potential relationships between customers’ needs and technical requirements. In most new product development (NPD), design characteristics (DCs) are employed as performance indicators to describe the technical requirements of a scheme. Previous studies have focused on evaluating the degree to which a scheme meets the performance value of DCs, disregarding the relationship between DCs and potential user preferences. This oversight leads to an inability to accurately predict customer satisfaction with the candidate schemes based on their preferences. Previous research, which was aimed at ensuring the preference value of schemes by utilizing mapping data between design preference (DP) and DCs, overlooked users' psychological states and thus failed to accurately capture their cognitive preferences for the schemes. To address these issues, an electroencephalogram (EEG) data-driven, implicit DP prediction approach is proposed. The method characterizes the implicit cognitive relationship between DP and DCs by mining EEG data and utilizes a back propagation (BP) neural network to predict DP. First, a user's DP word pairs were constructed based on the approach of statistical analysis, and the best-worst method (BWM) was introduced to obtain the importance of DCs. Second, an experiment was designed based on the extracted preference word pairs to collect EEG data that reflect a user's DC preference, record the user's stimulation state toward the DCs, and label their DP based on the segmentation results of preference evaluation. Third, a BP neural network was employed to construct a preference prediction model for DCs, and the reliability of the proposed preference prediction model was validated by using the forklift design example. The prediction results further exhibited the potential association between user preferences and DCs that can be acquired by EEG data mining. The results also provide support for designers to promptly acquire design concepts that satisfy user requirements (URs), thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of product development in a highly competitive market.}

The evolving system architecture gave the system an adaptive feature in the sense that it accepted alternative components based on the simulated changes in the environment. Architecture alternatives were generated through genetic algorithms (GA), while fuzzy logic was used to determine the fittest architectures based on the ambiguous multi-dimensional performance attributes provided by the customer modeled in quality function deployment (QFD). The weights of fuzzy associative memory (FAM) rules were randomly changed to simulate results of environmental effects and demonstrate how the system would self-adapt.}

To meet those needs, functional requirements are defined, which ultimately determine the product's physical characteristics and manufacturing. However, the functional and other non-geometrical information becomes less noticeable as the process advances, since the primary representation of the product design in the latter stages of the product development is often a purely geometrical model, causing information fragmentation. This fragmentation hinders the collaboration between different stakeholders while neglecting valuable product information that could facilitate its manufacturing. Research to date has not yet provided a suitable way to link the geometrical model of a product with its non-geometrical information. Focused on the assembly domain, this work proposes a way to integrate functional information into the product's geometrical model by using assembly features, which could be employed in the latter stages to extract process constraints and additional product details relevant to assembly process planning, as shown in the developed case study. This paper provides new insights into the value of the assembly feature as a functional information carrier and a tool for improving the collaboration between different stakeholders during the product development process.}

There exists an issue of loss of information and correlation during the extraction of edges in color images. To resolve it, a novel quaternion domain based Riesz fractional order directional derivative approach is presented in this paper to extract more edge details in color images. The Riesz fractional masks obtained by utilizing Aitken interpolation are applied on color images in the quaternion domain for yielding the edge map as there is no need for recalculation of basis polynomials in case of the addition of any data point. The performance of the proposed quaternion based technique is analyzed on the benchmark BSDS300 and BSDS500 datasets in the terms of Figure of Merit and F-Score. The results obtained exhibit the efficiency of proposed technique over the classical and state-of-the-art edge detection approaches. The robustness of this approach is further established by taking into account uncontrolled conditions such as noise, JPEG compression, and varying illumination as it provided more features than the classical integer-order detectors. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed quaternion based technique is validated for medical images as well as its application in image enhancement.}

In this work, we describe a robust methodology to determine process parameters to intentionally seed three distinct types of pore defect structures (i.e., lack of fusion, keyhole/trapped gas, and planar/linearly aligned defects) in AM builds, alongside control specimens with minimal porosity, through a design of experiments (DOE) study for alloy 718 (also known as IN718). Normalized enthalpy and melt pool overlap were considered to adequately populate the DOE space by varying laser power, scan speed, and hatch spacing, and porosity as a function of laser energy density was compared to the literature. Builds were characterized using optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), two computed tomography (CT) techniques with an order of magnitude difference in resolution, and strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiments. EBSD and cyclic straining revealed that the process parameters identified to seed different pore defects did not significantly affect the microstructure. LCF tests revealed a fatigue life delineation between baseline (i.e., minimal porosity) and seeded defect samples as described above. Common porosity metrics such as volume fraction and maximum defect size did not strongly correlate to fatigue resistance but did reveal the need to closely consider the CT (or other non-destructive evaluation technique) resolution to adequately characterize pore defects. The methodology established in this work will be vital in future modeling efforts to assess potential debits to fatigue resistance in the presence of pore defects.}

Most of these tools and systems are disconnected from product data/information management systems. The downside of disconnected tools for quality management is that the repeating issues that appear in multiple systems can obscure root cause investigations by isolating related data elements, with no means to understand relationships among them. Redundant work identifying and resolving quality issues can happen in multiple tools without an automated way to communicate knowledge learnt to other teams. This leads to inconsistent and incomplete problem resolutions that impede, not improve, product and process quality. In the recent development of new technologies, many IT tools have become available on the market and among them are the PLM systems proving very popular among companies which enable the creation and maintenance of complex industrial products. A comprehensive solution in the PLM Platform is presented in this paper that aims to link quality to product design, manufacturing planning, and business-critical processes such as change management. The approach provides cross-disciplinary teams and the extended supply chain with powerful closed-loop capabilities to identify and manage risk, improve quality, meet customer requirements, and attain environmental, safety, and information management compliance.}

A total of 27 environmentally stable QTL were identified in at least five environments, 20 of which were derived from Ae. tauschii T015, explaining up to 24.27% of the phenotypic variations. The major QTL for kernel length (KL), QKl-2D.5, was delimited to a physical interval of approximately 2.6 Mb harboring 52 candidate genes. Three Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers were successfully developed based on nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations of candidate gene AetT093_2Dv1G100900.1 and showed that A-WI lines with the T015 haplotype had significantly longer KL than the Zhou18 haplotype across all 11 environments. Four primary valuable A-WIs with good trait performance and carrying yield-related QTL were selected for breeding improvement. The results will facilitate the efficient transfer of beneficial genes from Ae. tauschii into wheat cultivars to improve wheat yield and other traits.}

abstract = {Lack of methods on standardising the prioritisation of technologies within the context of Through-life Engineering Services (TES) has been identified. Inspired by the TES value streams and support activity assets, existing within a common TES framework, a new design framework for technologies prioritisation is proposed. A dynamic toolkit to identify the most suitable technology is also developed, using a Quality Function Deployment method, Analytic Hierarchy Process and ROI analysis. A real case study from the defence sector is employed to validate the developed design framework and toolkit; the results show a well-structured guide that can effectively simplify the decision-making process.}

abstract = {Traditional Kansei Engineering (KE) often relies heavily on the designers’ prior knowledge to study user emotional requirements. However, cognitive differences between designers and users can result in Ming-style furniture failing to gain consumer acceptance when introduced to the market. To enhance the objectivity and accuracy of the design process, this study proposes an improved evaluation and design method that integrates Game Theory (GT) with Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) based on KE. This approach aims to identify truly critical emotional requirements and accurately translate them into design characteristics. First, emotional requirements are collected, and the product form is analyzed and deconstructed. Next, the Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SFAHP) and Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) are employed to calculate the subjective and objective weights of emotional requirements, respectively. Then, GT is used to find the optimal equilibrium weights to select the critical emotional requirements. Finally, an intelligent evaluation system is built using a combination of PSO and SVR to determine the relationship between critical user emotional requirements and product design characteristics, thereby identifying the optimal design parameters for Ming-style furniture. The results reveal that the most critical user emotional requirements are “concise”, “ornate”, and “dynamic”. In addition, the user evaluation results of the optimal design closely match the system’s predicted outcomes, validating the feasibility and advancement of the proposed method. Compared to most KE studies that focus solely on expert knowledge, this study better balances the subjective experience of designers with objective information of users, improving the accuracy of product design decisions and helping designers develop innovative products that align closely with user requirements.}

abstract = {Design for upgrade remanufacturing (DfURem) of used products is the generation of the optimal scheme in remanufacturing, with the purpose of improving function and performance to overcome functional obsolescence. However, the demands for upgraded remanufactured products are often characterized by individuation and diversification. Moreover, due to the wide variety of used parts, failure forms and failure degree, the failure characteristic presents DfURem with a unique challenge. As a result the generation of DfURem schemes for used products is currently prohibitively individual and inefficient. To address this, this paper develops a customized method to implement DfURem task based on individual demands and failure characteristics of used products. Firstly, the Quality Function Deployment for Life (QFDL) model is constructed to transform the multi-attribute life and performance demands into engineering characteristics through data analysis theory, aiming to satisfy customer demands more accurately. Secondly, a hybrid approach integrating Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Constraint-Function-Behavior-Structure-Upgradation (CFBSU) is proposed to generate the DfURem scheme. Engineering characteristics and failure characteristics are used to drive the CBR-CFBSU hybrid approach together, and compatibility constraints are identified and addressed. The DfURem scheme is retrieved in CBR by the nearest neighbor algorithm to calculate similarity, and the knowledge representation model of CFBSU model is constructed complementary to CBR, which transforms the engineering characteristics into implementable DfURem schemes by layer mapping. Finally, a case study of a used lathe part is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Background
As the market demands change, SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) have long faced many design issues, including high costs, lengthy cycles, and insufficient innovation. These issues are especially noticeable in the domain of cosmetic packaging design.
Objective
To explore innovative product family modeling methods and configuration design processes to improve the efficiency of enterprise cosmetic packaging design and develop the design for mass customization.
Methods
To accomplish this objective, the basic-element theory has been introduced and applied to the design and development system of the product family.
Results
By examining the mapping relationships between the demand domain, functional domain, technology domain, and structure domain, four interrelated models have been developed, including the demand model, functional model, technology model, and structure model. Together, these models form the mechanism and methodology of product family modeling, specifically for cosmetic packaging design. Through an analysis of a case study on men’s cosmetic packaging design, the feasibility of the proposed product family modeling technology has been demonstrated in terms of customized cosmetic packaging design, and the design efficiency has been enhanced.
Conclusion
The product family modeling technology employs a formalized element as a module configuration design language, permeating throughout the entire development cycle of cosmetic packaging design, thus facilitating a structured and modularized configuration design process for the product family system. The application of the basic-element principle in product family modeling technology contributes to the enrichment of the research field surrounding cosmetic packaging product family configuration design, while also providing valuable methods and references for enterprises aiming to elevate the efficiency of cosmetic packaging design for the mass customization product model.}

Thus, traditional ecodesign methods are not appropriate because they reason by fixing the functional definition of products/systems and address the complexity of these new systems in a simplistic way, which leads to a marginal reduction of impacts. Moreover, these methods do not consider the attractiveness for users, leading to an optimization oriented towards functional reduction. In this paper, a comprehensive ecodesign approach is presented suggesting a paradigm shift, which involves a hybrid ecodesign approach based on constraint modeling of systems based on the constraint satisfaction problem formalism (CSP) with more traditional environmental assessment methods to decide which design choices to make. This approach was applied to generate and characterize product and life cycle architectures of a serial hybrid vehicle powertrain focusing on the use and end-of-life phase.}

However, public transit infrastructures are generally facing extensive deterioration that requires extensive funds by governments to retain back the desired performance levels. The real case is that most governments are heavily facing a budget scarcity dilemma, and cannot withstand the acquired maintenance costs to maintain a proper operation for subway network. This research aims at introducing a new risk-based multi-objective optimization framework for optimizing performance and budget allocation among subway systems in fulfillment to maintenance planning development in this domain. This would extensively ease the decision-making process for subway asset managers by providing the optimal allocated budget for each subway system in an automated way. The framework targets the vital subway operating systems, namely: railway tracks, overhead catenary, lighting & power supply, centralized control, communication, signaling, rolling stock, and ticketing. The research framework develops four main modules; Reliability Centered Maintenance Database, Deterioration Modelling, Multi-objective Optimization, and Decision-Making. Reliability Centered Maintenance Database where subway operating systems are decomposed to components levels showing their functions, operational failures, failure causes, failure effects, failure consequences, responsive maintenance actions, and the hourly maintenance costs. Deterioration Modeling using deterministic and artificial intelligence models to estimate future conditions of subway components. Multi-objective optimization, and decision-making are developed to decide the optimal maintenance frequencies that derive lowest maintenance costs and lowest risk of failure for each functional failure. An actual case-study is worked out to verify the proposed framework. The results reveal the greatest share of the maintenance budget was allocated to lighting & power supply rectifier station with a 54% of the total maintenance budget, followed by rolling stock system with 32%, railway tracks system with 7%, signaling system with 3%, and approximately 1% for each of the remaining systems.}

Hazelnut is an essential fruit for meeting the energy needs of the body, and it grows in temperate climates, with Turkey being the largest producer in the world. However, changing climatic conditions, activities carried out unconsciously in the field of production, and the use of agricultural products and their content affect the quality of hazelnuts. To survive in this competitive environment, hazelnut producers in Turkey need to improve the cultivation process and meet customer expectations. In this context, the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PF-AHP) integrated Quality Function Deployment methodology is employed to analyze the cultivation process of hazelnuts grown in Turkey. Firstly, customer expectations are defined through literature review, experts' opinions, and customers' opinions on the Quality Function Deployment application. The expectations are then prioritized using PF-AHP. In order to meet the customer expectations, strategies to achieve required technical characteristics are designed based on interviews with producers. A relationship matrix is established to examine the impact of customer expectations on the product and production process, taking into account the technical characteristics. This process is examined using Quality Function Deployment. The results show that “Price stability due to state policies” is the most important customer expectation, and “Low costs” is a vital strategy to improve the quality of hazelnut production. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are performed to evaluate the proposed method and test its accuracy. This study presents a practical and effective approach for farmers and companies to improve the quality of hazelnut production, and can be used as a reference for other agricultural products. The results of the study can provide directions to be developed in the cultivation process for hazelnuts grown in Turkey.}

abstract = {At first, this research seeks to develop the technology required to fabricate two surfaces of revolution via filament winding: a concavity and a convexity. Concerning mandrels technology, the detachable mandrel concept is chosen among others. Their engineering is conducted conventionally based on free-thinking design approaches, as well as expertise and overconfidence. Consequently, the demoulding process of the concave surface is inefficient due to the lack of adequate dismantling functions of the respective mandrel, leading to damage of the composite material during demoulding, mandrel rework and delays. These inconveniences motivated a reexamination of the mandrels design process. Thus, three structured design methods were incorporated: Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA), Functional Analysis (FA) and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, a.k.a. TRIZ). Their synergistic implementation allowed the correct demoulding of the concave surface of revolution. In a second stage, this experience serves as reference for proposing a comprehensive, iterative, prescriptive and unified approach aimed at filament-wound products. It focuses on the base material (composites) and the manufacturing process (filament winding), being applicable to other fabrication processes of composite products. It is based on three models reported in the literature: one for metals, one for composites and one for filament-wound composites. Each of its steps is carried out with well-known structured design methods employed in products and systems engineering, including but not limited to DFMA, FA and TRIZ. As regards results, at the level of the design problem of the mandrels, the importance of the correct establishment of mechanical functions – dismantling in this case – is observed. In particular, how the lack of demoulding functions impacts unfavorably the quality of the final product. As respects the comprehensive approach, a significant outcome is the “filament winding thinking,” as an evolution of other schemes such as “metals” or “composites thinking” followed to generically develop products according to the nature of their base material.}

In addition, the modeling approach presented makes it possible to assess separately the effects of possibility and flexibility inherent or permitted in the design process on the overall design. Knowledge of the impact of the possibility and flexibility on customer satisfaction can also serve as a guideline for acquiring additional information to reduce fuzziness in the system parameters as well as determine how much flexibility is warranted or possible to improve a design.

Integrating and considering sustainability in product development requires the definition and review of appropriate metrics. However, there are no standardized approaches to formulating technical requirements based on standards and guidelines for developing sustainable products. The key question is therefore how sustainability can be projected from the high-level of abstract guidelines to the granular component level to achieve data-based improvement with targeted measures. This paper presents a novel method that employs use-case specific metrics to select existing sustainable development frameworks and to translate them into technical requirements on the product level. The result is a computer-aided method to formulate sustainability requirements based on standardized guidelines. With the help of a discrete manufacturing use case, the concept is validated and discussed.

However, the current techniques employed for selecting architectural glass material do not take into account the aspect of sustainability in the ultimate adoption of material solutions, as perceived by the stakeholders. This study aims to develop a comprehensive evaluation criteria system and introduce a group decision support framework that utilizes Building Information Modeling technology to facilitate the selection of SAGM in large-scale projects, in accordance with the demands of various stakeholders. The proposed framework is utilized to address a selection problem related to SAGM faced by a large construction corporation in Wuhan. The findings indicate that the criteria of daylighting and thermal insulation performance hold significant importance, with insulating glass being a subtype of SAGM exhibiting superior performance. Ultimately, the proposed model is subjected to sensitivity and comparative analyses to validate its advantages over several existing methodologies. The proposed model in this study offers practitioners an optimized methodology for the selection of SAGM, while also providing a framework for the selection of other sustainable building materials.}

The foundation of the HOQ is the belief that products should be designed to reflect customers' desires and taste. HOQ is performed by a multidisciplinary team representing marketing, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and any other functions considered critical by the company. In general, it provides a framework in which all participants can communicate their thoughts about a product. More specifically, HOQ is often used to identify the relationships between requirements based on different viewpoints. There are two issues in analyzing these requirements using HOQ. First, requirements are often described informally using vague terms. However, lack of formal way in interpreting the semantics of these requirements makes it difficult to determine if a realization of the system meets its customer's needs. Second, identifying relationships between requirements is often time consuming. Sometimes, it is difficult to arrive at a group consensus on a particular relationship between requirements. To address these issues, we have developed a fuzzy logic-based extension to HOQ for capturing imprecise requirements to both facilitate communication of team members and have a formal representation of requirements. Based on this representation, we developed a heuristic inference scheme to reason about the implicit relationships between requirements. We illustrate our approach using a textile mill supply business application.}

Among them, the aesthetic value of biodiversity is of strong importance as it contributes to human well-being and increases the collective willingness to engage in conservation efforts. Using the endangered coralligenous reefs along the French Mediterranean coastline as a case study, we propose a quantitative approach to estimate the aesthetic and ecological values of a marine ecosystem. We combined human image evaluation and deep learning algorithms to provide a quantitative estimation of the aesthetic value of 7692 photographic quadrats among 160 stations located between 20 and 90 m depth and gathered on 95 sites. To understand how aesthetic value is related to biodiversity metrics, environmental variables and anthropogenic pressures we used a structural equation modelling approach. We found that taxonomic diversity and species composition explained a significant part of the aesthetic value of the coralligenous reefs. Taxonomic diversity showed a net positive effect and species composition analysis highlighted both positive and negative effects of some species on the aesthetic value. Net negative effects of functional and phylogenetic diversities were found, which illustrates an aesthetic bias in human perception of ecological value. The aesthetic and ecological values were mapped along the French Mediterranean coastline in three dimensions (longitude, latitude, depth); this synthetic visualization could be of strong interest for conservation and communication purposes about this endangered benthic key-ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea. Overall, our approach provides a geographically scalable estimate of the aesthetic value of biodiversity which is still an underestimated facet of nature contributions to people. It could be transposed to other marine ecosystems such as coral reefs but also to terrestrial landscapes for which an increasing number of images evaluated for human preference are becoming available.}

abstract = {Hydrodynamics is often applied to quantum phenomena such as heavy-ion collisions. But here it should be noted that local equilibrium is not always realized in these collision processes and also the quantum effect is not fully taken into account in hydrodynamics. In this sense, a fluid-dynamical treatment of quantum many-body systems which does not presuppose local equilibrium is required. As an attempt in this direction, we derive simultaneous equations governing the motion of local variables such as the particle density ρ(r, t) and velocity field ν(r, t) by averaging a many-body wave function. The equations obtained will be shown to unify into a single nonlinear Schrödinger-type equation. Hence this is worthy of being called a quantum fluid dynamics (QFD). In deriving the QFD, we have employed the time-dependent Hartree-Fock and the generalized scaling approximation. Particularly, in order to attain self-containedness, we have assumed a certain relation which is valid in the case of the locally isotropic strain tensor. The introduction of anisotropy requires other local variables reflecting explicitly the deviation from local equilibrium and thus has been left as a future task.}

Most research solves this prioritisation problem based on the high risks identified in Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). However, an empirical case study on a UK-based engine manufacturer highlights that the aim of testing is not only to detect technical failures but also to validate customer requirements. Based on the findings identified from the empirical study, this paper proposes a systematic approach for testing activity prioritisation, where fuzzy relational decision matrices are established to link customer requirements, technical objectives and testing activities. An XOR Best–Worst Method (BWM) and an extended simple additive weighting (SAW) method are developed to calculate the weights of customer requirements and score the testing activities. The approach also handles two uncertainty scenarios during the prioritisation process, i.e. the subjective judgements of choosing from options and the linguistic vagueness of the decisions. The application in a case from the engine manufacturing company illustrates the methodological improvement in the prioritisation process. The proposed method ranks the testing activities, which suggests an order of effort distribution for the test plan.}

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of C. burnetii exposure in a cohort of Australian wildlife rehabilitators (AWRs) and assess Q fever disease and vaccination status within this population. Blood samples were collected from adult participants attending the Australian Wildlife Rehabilitation Conference in Sydney in July 2018. Participants completed a questionnaire at the time of blood collection. Antibody titres (IgG, IgA and IgM) against phase I and phase II C. burnetii antigens as determined by immunofluorescence assay, revealed that of the unvaccinated participants, 6.1% (9/147) had evidence of exposure to C. burnetii. Of the total participants, 8.1% (13/160) had received Q fever vaccination, four of whom remained seropositive at the time of blood collection. Participants reporting occupational contact with ruminants, were eight times more likely to have been vaccinated against Q fever, than those reporting no occupational animal contact (OR 8.1; 95% CI 1.85–45.08). Three AWRs (2%) reported having had medically diagnosed Q fever, two of whom remained seropositive at the time of blood collection. Despite the lack of association between macropod contacts and C. burnetii seropositivity in this cohort, these findings suggest that AWRs are approximately twice as likely to be exposed to C. burnetii, compared with the general Australian population. This provides support for the recommendation of Q fever vaccination for this potentially ‘at-risk’ population. The role of macropods in human Q fever disease remains unclear, and further research into C. burnetii infection in macropods including: infection rate and transmission cycles between vectors, macropods as reservoirs, other animals and humans is required.}

To address the problem, this paper proposes a DfRem scheme generation method that combines the Quality Function Deployment for Low-Carbon (QFDC) model with the FMAS (Functional-Motion-Action-Structure) model. Firstly, the demands are categorized into customer, remanufacturability and low-carbon demands, and the FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) is used to evaluate the weight of demands. Secondly, the QFDC model is developed to convert demands to engineering characteristics, and to determine the design priorities. Thirdly, the FMAS model is established to map engineering characteristics into related structures, and a low-carbon and customer-satisfied DfRem scheme is generated. Finally, the efficacy of proposed method is demonstrated through a case study on the remanufacturing of a CNC milling machine, displaying its superiority in reducing carbon emissions while meeting customer demands.}

Therefore, lightweight design emerges as one possibility to reduce material and energy consumptions across the entire product life cycle. The resulting demand for lightweight products and systems has led to a large diversity of strategies, construction techniques and methods (summarized as tools), whose application has not yet proceeded in a systematic and target-oriented way. Therefore, this publication presents a methodology for the situation-appropriate selection of lightweight design tools along the product development process. For this purpose, requirements of lightweight design as well as generic targets and boundary conditions have first been identified, followed by the determination of their interrelationships with existing lightweight design tools based on an expert survey. This facilitates the selection of appropriate tools for optimal lightweight design through a quality-function-deployment-oriented approach. The proposed methodology is validated on the conceptual design of two bicycle trailers (cargo vs. children’s trailer) with distinct requirements. The results indicate that the methodology provides a strategic and systematic guidance for the implementation of lightweight design in products to developers and can thus reduce development efforts.}

A three-stage framework is developed on supply chain quality, configuration and technology management. This is based on a survey of the perceptions of practicing managers from an OEM (original equipment manufacturer). The three-stage process involves empirical assessment of strategic supply chain quality, configuration and technology variables and then using quality function deployment to deploy them to improve the competitiveness of the supply chain. The focus of this multi-dimensional approach is on the selection of a suitable supplier considering multi-criteria by integrating Quality Function Deployment (QFD) tool with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution TOPSIS. A number of decision determinants for supply chain resilience have been chosen as technical requirements and customer criteria's. Furthermore, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has also been embedded to deal with linguistic judgments expressing relationships and correlations required in QFD. TOPSIS is used to develop the ranking of a number of suppliers considering different multi-dimensional parameters in a uniform system. To illustrate the practical implications of the methodology, the approach are exemplified with the help of a case study in the automobile OEM scenario. This concept has helped in decision making in the occurrence of disruption on the performance of the supply chain system. Based on the strategic model developed, some very interesting managerial insights are offered with respect to the effect of cost efficient operations and resiliency in volatile or competitive global market scenario for choosing alternate suppliers, which in turn affects the overall supply chain performance. Finally decision maker's perception has taken an important role for the supplier selection i.e., whether he is much more worry about cost or rational to pay moderately for developing a resilient system in the supply chain.}

The House of Quality, Morphological Chart, and Pugh tools were adopted to select the best conceptual design among the available design options. The approach of product design selection is based on ranking in engineering characteristics to generate design options. The benchmark design in this study is a timer system with two stock tanks. Conceptual Design 4 was selected as the advanced conceptual design because this system uses a Programmable Logic Controller to control the blending process of fertiliser solutions precisely with minimal nutrient loss and water runoff. A design prototype was developed for Design 4 using SolidWorks by considering all selection parameters of chosen criteria that were analysed based on the HOQ and Pugh methods. Conclusively, the proposed design of the Automated Fertilizer Blending System can provide technological innovation in designing this device. This will assist in coordinating better product development for potential product commercialization toward achieving sustainable and precise agriculture.}

The way technologies are assessed in the early design stages plays a crucial role in the integration of sustainability into innovation activities – a necessary step towards the development of products and processes with better environmental and social consequences. However, existing sustainability assessment tools are difficult to deploy in the highly uncertain and data-scarce front-end of innovation. In order to ascertain the efficacy of technology assessment methods, a systematic literature review was conducted to systematize best practices in technology assessment and establish a set of design propositions to improve early-stage sustainability assessment. Subsequently, recommendations for designing and effectively implementing sustainability assessment tools in technology development were elicited. Several avenues for future research are proposed, including the testing and refinement of the design propositions and how to operationalize early-stage sustainability assessment.}

abstract = {A Rough Modelling Methodology is presented, using the European Prestandard ENV40 003 1990-04-18 “CIM-Systems Architecture-Framework for Enterprise modelling” (“CIM-OSA Cube”) as a guiding framework. The phases of the modelling project, Requirements Definition, Design Specification and Implementation Description, are derived from it. The “learning from others” dimension of CIM-OSA is applied by looking for reference solutions from other plant projects. Instead of the preliminary CIM-OSA modelling methods, the current industry practice methods and tools are used as the basis of the development. Othermodelling methods, like QFD, SA/SD etc. are considered to be linked into Rough Modelling Methodology. This research is been done in the project “Rough Modelling”, which is included in the Finnish national technology programme “Developing the Implementation of Plant Project Deliveries”(PRODEAL). The participating companies and organisations of the “Rough Modelling” project are the following: Wärtsilä Diesel Power Plants, AGA Consulting, IVO Engineering International, Federation of Finnish Metal Engineering and Electro technical Industries (FIMET), Helsinki University of Technology Institute of Industrial Automation, and Technology Development Center of Finland (TEKES).}

abstract = {Scrum is an iterative and incremental development framework that, nowadays, is mainly used for software development. In this work, a Scrum-Based New Product Development (SBNPD) approach is introduced. This new framework stems from the basis of Scrum and incorporates tools suitable for being applied to the design and development of physical products. The proposed approach implies that feedback from early adopters is to be gathered throughout the whole project, thereby driving to validated learning within a co-creation process. A case study illustrates how the SBNPD framework is applied for the development of a physical product within the dental industry.}
