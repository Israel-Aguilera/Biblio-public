abstract = {Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is one of the most powerful reliability analysis techniques for identifying and preventing potential risks across various fields. Current FMEA methods, while effective, still present several shortcomings. For example, using experts’ subjective pairwise comparisons of risk factors to determine their weights reduces the stability of the result; different relationships among failure modes are often ignored. To improve the performance of FMEA, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have been employed to support risk evaluation and prioritization in recent years. This paper proposes a novel FMEA method by exploring several MCDM techniques. First, the Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation (ELICIT) are utilized to generate group risk assessments under uncertainty. Then, grey relation analysis (GRA) is incorporated into the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to objectively determine the weight of risk factors. Afterward, the traditional ORESTE (organísation, rangement et Synthèse de données relarionnelles (in French)) method is generalized to the ELICIT environment to prioritize the failure modes, in which the Besson’s ranking is replaced by deviation measure for more accurate ranking results. Finally, a case study of FMEA for electro-mechanical actuators is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that our approach can express risk information more flexibly, determine the weight of risk factors more objectively, and prioritize failure modes more reasonably.}

Above all, the delivery of the 1150°C hot glass gob and its loading into the mould is a critical procedure. On machines used today with up to 12 forming sections the current delivery system is reaching its limit. The objective of this work is solving the contradiction – improving gob loading, i.e. temperature constancy, homogeneity, and speed without altering the machine setup – by using the TRIZ method. The result, a modified path of the movement with the trajectory of a clothoid, has been derived theoretically, put into practice, and tested experimentally. Assessment of the new trajectory has been performed by measuring the gob velocity and by recording the gob fall with a high speed camera. By means of the newly designed trajectory, wear of the delivery channel has been reduced. The variation in travelling speed of the gob on its way through the delivery system has also been able to be reduced. Furthermore, the gob loading into the mould has been improved as well. The gob remains standing vertically in the mould and will not tip off to one side. The result of this measure does not only increase the service life, but also improves the quality produced.}

abstract = {Objectives
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) improve outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) but are infrequently used. We sought to compare the locations of OHCAs and AEDs in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona.
Methods
Public location OHCAs and AEDs were geocoded utilizing a statewide OHCA database (1/2010–12/2012) and AED registry. OHCAs were mapped using kernel-density estimation and overlapped with AED placements. Spearman's rho was obtained to determine the correlation between OHCA incidents and AED locations.
Results
A total of 654 consecutive public location OHCAs and all 1704 non-medical facility AEDs registered in the study area were included in the analysis. High OHCA incident areas lacking AEDs were identified in the kernel-density surface map. OHCA event/AED correlation analysis showed a weak correlation (Spearman's rho=0.283; p=0.002). Events occurred most frequently at locations categorized as “In Cars/Roads/Parking lots” (190/654, 29.1%) and there were no identified AEDs for these areas. AEDs were placed most frequently in “Public business/Office/Workplace” and cardiac arrests occurred with the second highest frequency in this location type.
Conclusion
There was a weak correlation between OHCA events and deployed AEDs. It was possible to identify areas where OHCAs occurred frequently but AEDs were lacking. The ability to correlate the sites of OHCAs and AED locations is a necessary step toward improving the effectiveness of public access defibrillation.}

In such decisions, managers can find it difficult to select the right device for their company. To address the Smart Watch (SW) selection problem, this article introduces an assessment framework established on a Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) Multi-Criteria Decision-Making technique to collectively consider parameters affecting the eventual decision. Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) are utilized to integrate choices of decision makers into the decision-making procedure, where their thoughts and ideas about a decision problem can be of an uncertain nature, making it hard to express their assessments with crisp numbers. The proposed method handles the partiality in decision-making processes with a Group Decision Making (GDM) approach. This paper first showcases an integrated HFL Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)-HFL Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) method. The framework’s functionality is then illustrated in a case study about SW assessment. The originality of the paper is based on its evaluation framework using an integrated SAW-ARAS approach in the hesitant fuzzy environment, its research method and case application in the logistics sector. This approach can guide managers and practitioners for an effective SW selection process.}

Since buildings are the largest contributor to global warming emissions, improving their energy performance through the implementation of renewable energy technologies is a way forward to reduce energy use and thus carbon footprint. This article presents a new building envelope system that harvests solar energy through the steel skin of the façade of the building. The energy is generated by a steel sandwich panel featuring a modular design that enables full integration into the building envelope of both new constructed and refurbished buildings. The heat transfer means is a glycol and water mixture that flows inside a pipework arrangement embedded into the sandwich panel and connected to a distribution system. This distribution system deploys the energy generated into a buffer tank for further production of heating, cooling and domestic hot water through the use of a heat pump. The elements of this solar system were developed under the framework of the Building Active Steel Skin Envelope (BASSE) project funded by the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS). A detailed description of the components of the BASSE system as well as how they were developed is presented. Building on satisfactory thermal testing and the successful implementation of the system on a pilot building, the BASSE system was validated. The experimental results have shown that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is in between 4.1–4.6. A validated simulation tool estimated that the cladding panel generates 3321.14 kWh/year which is 30.4% efficiency. Simulation results showed that a 35 BASSE panel installation on residential buildings subjected to temperate climate are Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB).}

Japanese companies and other foreign competitors have moved into markets that were once dominated by American companies, by producing higher quality products. The problem to date in the U.S. has obviously not been the lack of resources or documentation on quality and improvement programs, but the misdirection of these programs and the lack of total management commitment. Total Quality Management (TQM) is seen as an effective method that will accomplish the task of higher quality levels, and increased productivity. The purpose of Total Quality Management is to implement a process that is long term and continuous, in which all of management participates in establishing continuous improvement initiatives throughout the organization, beginning with their own function in the organization. TQM integrates the fundamental techniques and principles of Quality Function Deployment, Taguchi Methods, Statistical Process Control, Just-In-Time, and existing management tools into a structured approach. The primary objective of this approach is to incorporate quality and integrity into all functions at all levels of the organization. This paper examines the TQM process, philosophy, concepts, attributes and how it can be used to develop a “quality-based” culture. The paper also examines the introduction and implementation of the TQM process at an electronic's manufacturer.}

This circumstance demands accurate and timely maintenance actions in alignment with the organizational objectives. Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is a strategy that considers information about the equipment condition to recommend appropriate maintenance actions. The main purpose of CBM is to prevent functional failures or a significant performance decrease of the monitored equipment. CBM relies on a wide range of resources and techniques required to detect deviations from the normal operating conditions, diagnose incipient failures or predict the future condition of an asset. To obtain meaningful information for maintenance decision making, relevant data must be collected and properly analyzed. Recent advances in Big Data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT) enable real-time decision making based on abundant data acquired from several different sources. However, each appliance must be designed according to the equipment configuration and considering the nature of specific failure modes. CBM implementation is a complex matter, regardless of the equipment characteristics. Therefore, to ensure cost-effectiveness, it must be addressed in a systematic and organized manner, considering the technical and financial issues involved. This paper presents a literature review on approaches to support CBM implementation. Published studies and standards that provide guidelines to implement CBM are analyzed and compared. For each existing approach, the steps recommended to implement CBM are listed and the main gaps are identified. Based on the literature, factors that can affect the effective implementation of CBM are also highlighted and discussed.}

The focus of this work is on the provision of a hybrid decision model and framework for improved cooperative design decision support. The novelty of the work is in combination of different models or methods, algorithms for making collaborative design decisions in both objective and subjective natures, in particular the fuzzy negotiation mechanism using the hybrid decision model.

In this paper the authors identify a set of challenges related to the design of mechatronic systems. The challenges are mostly related to integration of design and analysis tools, and automation of current design practices. Addressing these challenges enables the adoption of a concurrent development approach in which the synergetic effects that characterize mechatronic systems are taken into account during design. The main argument is that in order to deal with software development problems for complex mechatronic systems, there is a need to look at system design practices beyond concurrency, i.e., there is a need to consider the complex interdependencies among subsystems and the designers that develop them. A review on current methods and tools is carried out to identify possible solutions proposed in previous works. The purpose is not to make an extensive review, but to show that integration, from different points of view, is a major issue and that increasing the level of abstraction in the description of systems can help to overcome the integration challenges. An increased level of abstraction also forms a basis for addressing other issues in mechatronic product development, which are presented in this work. With that in mind, concepts for an integration framework are proposed. The goal of the framework is to support a multi-disciplinary design team to (almost) automatically generate and verify control software. Based on high-level architectural descriptions, the software generation and verification process can be supported by knowledge-based methods and tools. Other goals are to support communication among engineers, improve reliability of designs, increase reuse of design knowledge, and reduce development time and development costs.}

In application domains such as health care, this technology can become pervasive only if the perceived ”quality in use” is appropriate. How to measure chatbot quality is an open question. The international standard ISO/IEC 25010 proposes a set of characteristics (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom from risk, and context coverage) to be considered when the ”quality in use” of a software system has to be measured.
Basic procedure
This study proposes a clinical chatbot comparison method based on quality. The proposed approach is based on Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology (AHP).
Findings
Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a set of measures for each characteristic of ISO/IEC 25010 according to three classes of functionality: providing information, providing prescriptions and process management. Moreover a quantitative method is proposed for making homogeneous the pairwise weights when the AHP is used for the ”quality-in-use” comparison. As a case study, a comparison of two versions of a chatbot was performed.
Conclusions
The results show that the proposed approach provides an effective reference base for performing quality comparisons of medical chatbots compliant with the ISO/IEC 25010 standard.}

The generation of a range of feasible action plans is a difficult task because many production variables need to be taken into account. Traditionally, such decisions were often made primarily on intuition and past experience. These approaches, though appropriate at times may not give the best results. To some extent, various techniques and decision support systems have helped managers to explore the issue, but with limitations. This paper describes the ongoing study to develop a software tool (TAPS) to assist managers in the generation of action plans, and the creation of a process to guide industrial companies through making such decisions. TAPS is based on Burbidge's Connectance Concept. TAPS helps managers to visualise and represent their perceptions of the relationships between variables and objectives through a sequential, analytical process. A manufacturing objective is linked to relevant variables to provide managers with a coherent picture of the levers that could be manipulated to achieve the desired outcome. This enables several possible action plans to be created. Saaty's analytic hierarchy process is used in the process for the evaluation and selection between alternative actions. This paper describes TAPS and its process, as well as its application in an industrial case and concludes with a discussion of its contribution to managerial practice.}

The effect of an increase in the excited-state contribution in a two-state ensemble is more pronounced in global reactivity parameters than the local ones. Global reactivity indices are found to be more sensitive to the external perturbation, for the whole time-dependent process, than the local indices. Most of the local quantities show drastic changes only at the beginning of the processes. In the atom–field interaction problem, electronegativity, polarizability and entropy oscillate with the field and hardness attains a steady value after the initial transients die out. The ion–atom collision process can be divided into three distinct regimes in terms of the time-dependent electronegativity profile. In the encounter regime, hardness and entropy maximize and polarizability minimizes. Dynamical variants of the principles of maximum hardness, maximum entropy and minimum polarizability are shown to be operative.}

Meanwhile, the contact between the coating and substrate or rust was relatively close. Additionally, the corrosion potential and corrosion current density respectively were −0.465 v/7.247 × 10−7 A/cm2, -0.736 v/5.958 × 10−5 A/cm2, and -0.574 v/2.305 × 10−6 A/cm2.

The prevalence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is well known; however, statewide variability exits across the United States. The aim of our study was to determine the overall incidence, socioeconomic and racial disparities in the development of CRC in the state of Arizona.
Methods
We performed a 16-year (1995 to 2011) retrospective review of the Arizona Cancer Registry including all patients with CRC. Patient demographics, stage of CRC disease, and patient outcomes were recorded. The outcome measures were incidence of CRC and the difference in racial and economic characteristics among patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the incidence of CRC.
Results
A total of 40,314 patients with CRC were included of which 16% (n = 6,450) were stage IV. The overall incidence of CRC decreased 17% over the study period. The highest incidence rates were seen in White non-Hispanic and African American populations. Right-sided tumors were more common in White non-Hispanic and African Americans whereas American Indians had higher incidence of rectal tumors and Asian/Pacific Islanders more commonly had left-sided tumors. African Americans had the highest occurrence (42.8%) of more advanced disease (stage III and stage IV). A negative correlation existed between socioeconomic status and the incidence of CRC.
Conclusions
Overall CRC incidence decreased in Arizona by 17%, with greatest decrease rate among, White non-Hispanic and African American populations. Educated patients with higher economic earnings experienced a lower decrease in the incidence of CRC.}

This paper dedicates to filling this research gap by introducing a utility-based hybrid FAD approach with an ordinal aggregation method. To do so, methods to calculate the possibility of achieving the functional requirements are firstly proposed to deal with five widely used evaluation expressions. In addition, a target-based weighted average operator is integrated with the FAD method so as to determine the whole ranking set of alternatives. Finally, given different evaluation standards used by different individuals, to avoid losing original opinions in information aggregation process, an ordinal aggregation method is developed to integrate the subordinate rank sets derived by individual experts into a collective one. An application to a credit risk assessment problem in supply chain finance is provided and the comparative analyses are conducted to highlight the developed method.}

Findings from the review are indicative of the fact that socio-technical complexity of industrial systems has increased. Recent developments in the area of risk management highlight the need for implementation of the latest robust techniques of risk assessment in the mining sector. In consideration of the present scenario, the development of a model for risk analysis having an interface between hazard identification and risk assessment, along with an interface between risk assessment and accident causation to predict if an accident will occur under given conditions, has become dire necessity. This will increase hazard awareness and enable mine management to select and prioritize problem areas and identify safety system weaknesses in both underground and surface mining. This will ultimately help decision makers, risk analysts and safety managers make a major contribution in the development of workplace safety with a near-to-zero accident rate.}

abstract = {The shipping industry has witnessed fiercer competition and more volatility. As a new source to increase profits, more and more liner companies are beginning to encroach on the downstream market, forming a co-opetition relationship between liner companies and freight forwarders. Insufficient (globally or regionally) capacity is also becoming a common problem to liner companies. This paper uses a game-theoretical model to study how can resilience be improved through capacity allocation and pricing in a shipping supply chain with insufficient capacity. We solve the model analytically and find that: The establishment of a direct selling platform (encroachment) helps the liner company to expand his competitive advantages, the price and profit of the liner company are higher than the counterparts of the freight forwarder. Moreover, with the spot market, deliberate capacity allocation and pricing strategy can help to enhance supply chain resilience in case of capacity shortage.}

Due to the complexity of assembly processes, a high ratio of tasks is still performed by human workers. Short-cyclically changing work contents due to smaller lot sizes, especially in the varied series assembly, increases both the need for information support as well as the risk of rising physical and psychological stress. The use of technical and digital assistance systems can counter these challenges. Through the integration of information and communication technology as well as collaborative assembly technologies, hybrid cyber-physical assembly systems will emerge. Widely established assembly planning procedures only facilitate the design of purely manual work system. In this paper, two new planning approaches for digital and technical support systems in cyber physical assembly systems will be outlined and discussed with regard to synergies and delimitations of planning perspectives.}

This class of ecodesign methods relies on - and is limited by - the creativity and previous knowledge of the designer. In contrast, bio-inspired design creates new concepts using analogical transfer from existing solutions found in nature. The resulting designs however do not necessarily have a lower environmental impact. This paper proposes to join ecodesign and bio-inspired design, combining the strengths of both and making them more accessible. The general recommendations resulting from ecodesign are used to steer the selection of relevant biological strategies, resulting in more tailored inspiration with the clear direction of improving the environmental impact. Starting from a single ecodesign recommendation, a number of diverse biological strategies are presented. Both the principles used by termites to passively regulate the temperature of their mound and the principles used by sharks and fish to reduce the drag across their skin can be used as an embodiment of the guideline to reduce energy consumption during use.}

The elements that impact SCS encompass all kinds of waste, emissions, green management, workers’ health and well-being, market competitiveness, transportation, and financial aspects of the network. Supply chain experts should integrate sustainability practices in different phases of the supply chain and encourage organizations to orient their efforts toward designing sustainable supply chains. In this study, we present a new metric, “supply chain sustainability index (SCSI)” to assess the overall sustainability of a biomass supply chain network through three criteria: environmental, social, and economic sustainability. To pursue the objective of the study, a Bayesian Network approach is implemented to depict the causal relationship among different variables and to demonstrate a better analysis of the subject. For further assessment and analysis of the overall sustainability of the supply chain network, sensitivity analysis and belief propagation are performed. Results indicate that all three criteria are imperative to SCSI prediction; however, economic sustainability has a slightly higher effect among the three criteria, while social criteria have the lowest effect on SCSI.}

The framework is called ‘total view framework’ because it provides the total set of product, process and organisation elements and their interactions from the outset in the development process. It uses systems engineering (SE) and concurrent engineering (CE) in an integrated manner, as part of the same framework. The framework extends the application of the SE process to life cycle processes and their performing organisations and applies CE at all levels of the hierarchical product breakdown structure. The ‘total view framework’ is supported by a method, called ‘concurrent structured analysis method’, that consists of the three analysis processes: requirements, functional and physical. These processes mirror the bulk of the SE process and are applied concurrently to product, process and organisations. The outputs of the method are requirements, functional attributes, physical attributes and the interactions among them. These outputs are then analysed using a clustering algorithm and a complexity metric based on cohesion and coupling shows the clustering effects.}

Most of the available Service Engineering models, methods and tools come from traditional engineering, business and computer science approaches adapted to the Service System or Product-Service System. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes a Service Engineering framework that integrates a product-service design modelling tool developed at the Tokyo Metropolitan University with a discrete event simulation test-bench, which enables the comparison of several PSS configurations and the evaluation of both customer and internal performance.

However, the quest for a reliable methodology to evaluate these platforms has remained pressing. While several studies have explored this domain, none have integrated decision experts’ confidence levels. This study bridges this gap by seamlessly incorporating confidence levels into Dombi aggregation operators within an intuitionistic fuzzy framework. The study introduces two innovative operators: the confidence-level intuitionistic fuzzy Dombi weighted averaging operator (CIFDWA) and the confidence-level intuitionistic fuzzy Dombi weighted geometric operator (CIFDWG). These operators are employed to form a novel multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) approach, which is demonstrated by applying them to select the optimal e-learning website in a real-world scenario. The “Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)” method is utilized to determine criteria weights. The findings highlight the critical importance of sub-criteria such as topic diversity, pricing, content credibility, data security, and user interface simplicity. The analysis reveals Unacademy as the leading platform, closely followed by Byju’s. Through meticulous comparative analysis and sensitivity evaluations, we underscore the stability and coherence of the proposed model. The study’s novelty lies in its innovative approach to integrating confidence levels in multi-attribute group decision-making scenarios, promising broader applications across various real-world contexts. Educational advisers and management can leverage this methodology to empower students with informed choices.}

However, few of previous literatures have proposed systematic product family design method based on data mining technology. To make up for this deficiency, this research put forward a systematic data-mining-based method for product family design and product configuration. First, the customer requirement information and product engineering information in the historical order are formatted into structural data. Second, principal component analysis is performed on historical orders to extract the customers' differentiated needs. Third, association rule algorithm is introduced to mine the rules between differentiated needs and module instances in the historical orders, thus obtained the configuration knowledge between customer needs and product engineer. Forth, the mined rules are used to construct association rule-based classifier (CBA) that is employed to sort out the best product configuration schemes as popular product variants. Fifth, sequence alignment technique is employed to identify modules for popular product variants, so that the module instances are divided into optional, common and special module, respectively, thereby the product platform is generated based on common modules. Finally, according to new customer needs, the CBA classifier is used to recommend the best configuration schemes, and then popular product variants are configured based on the product platform. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by the product family design example of desktop computer hosts.}

Unfortunately, correlating energy consumption with the products’ design features during the design process is a difficult task. To address this challenge, this paper uses the Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology as a bridge to link design features and energy consumption throughout the design process and proposes a FBS-based energy modelling method. This method divides the energy modelling process into two steps. The first is to identify the required energy information and characteristics from available data on the design. The second step is to arrange the obtained information in a logical order to create energy models. Two tools, namely the modified FBS framework and the energy flow diagram, are introduced to aid designers in respectively dealing with the two energy modelling steps. To demonstrate this method, a case study considering mechanical linkage servo press is carried out.}

By preprocessing using semi-fuzzy kernel clustering algorithm, original samples are divided into two subsets: deterministic samples and fuzzy samples. Only the fuzzy samples, rather than all original ones, require expert judgment to decide their categories and are selected as training samples to accomplish SVDD specification. Therefore, the samples preprocessing method can not only decrease experts working strength, but also achieve less computational consumption and better performance of the classifier. Nevertheless, in order to accomplish practical decision making, another condition has to be met: good explanations to the decision. A rule extraction method based on cooperative coevolution algorithm (CCEA), is introduced to achieve the target. To validate the proposed methodology, samples from real world were employed for experiments, with results compared with conventional multi-classification support vector machine approaches and other artificial intelligence techniques. Moreover, in terms of rule extraction, experiments on key parameters, different methods including decompositional and pedagogical ones etc. were also conducted.}

For example, ETC is a fundamental parameter for characterizing energy exploitation and utilization, such as the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical process. During the energy extraction from the deep subsurface, the effective pressure (the difference between the confining pressure and the pore pressure) will alter the microstructure of the porous medium, which will then change its ETC value. In light of the intrinsic randomness and disorder in the distribution of grains and pores in the deep subsurface, many researchers have focused on heat conduction to develop theoretical models of ETC. Less attention has been paid to the thermal and mechanical coupling processes. In this paper, a novel analytical model was derived to study the effect of effective pressure on ETC of porous materials based on fractal theory, Laplace′s equation and the theory of elastic mechanics. The newly developed ETC model considered the effective pressure, the liquid saturation, and the microstructure parameters. The model has also been validated against the experimental results. The model demonstrated that effective pressure increases the ETC of a given porous medium. Moreover, there is a larger change in ETC in porous materials with a smaller initial porosity compared to porous materials with a larger initial porosity. This work constitutes a comprehensive investigation of pressure-dependent ETC, which is a key issue in heat transfer in porous media.}

The prevalence of hypertension was highest in African Americans and Caribbean blacks, whereas Caribbean Hispanics were more likely to smoke and have dyslipidemia. Despite similar vascular risk factors and a shared genealogy, the proportion of LI differed in African Americans and Caribbean blacks. Conversely, no difference in the prevalence of LI was seen in African Americans and Caribbean Hispanics, even though the 2 groups had differences in vascular risk factors.

An organization has to compete to ensure its survival and the dimensions of competition are cost, quality, reliability, flexibility, service, and speed of delivery. Major commitments to these dimensions are usually made during the design stage of the product. Unfortunately, we observe in most organizations a widening gap between design and other business functions (Meikle (1989)). This article attempts to bridge this gap by: (1) defining “design” as a strategic activity to facilitate its participation in the corporate debate, and; (2) presenting a conceptual framework which integrates design with manufacturing and marketing as equal partners to support the overall corporate mission. In this article we examine the strategic nature of design. We define “design” and “design strategy” in a language that is familiar to business and present a conceptual framework that can be used to plan, implement, and control design activities strategically. According to this framework all dimensions of competition can be expressed by two basic design variables, complexity and innovation. The design strategy formulation process consists of two stages. In stage one we position a design using complexity and innovation levels to identify threats and opportunities, to evaluate consistency of design strategies, and to obtain an aggregate measure of effort required to support a design strategy. In stage two we use the strategic insight gained in stage one to select an appropriate infrastructure to support our design objectives. The framework presented in this article extends the manufacturing strategy framework by Hill (1989) to provide an effective interface between design, manufacturing, and marketing functions. We have used the dimensions of competition as the integrating force. This article also provides a foundation on which future empirical and analytical research can be based. It emphasizes the need for strategic management of design activity instead of relegating design to a traditional reactive role. In this respect the framework is a significant step towards reducing the existing gap between design and the other business functions, and can help corporate strategists use design as a competitive weapon.}

Our simulations show that most of the exchange of quanta between the electrons and the radiation occurs within the emitting metal tip. In typical experiments (λ=670nm with tungsten metal) the depth of penetration for the radiation is four times the mean free path for electrons at the Fermi level, so it is necessary to allow for scattering. We use a Floquet expansion with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to allow for the exchange of quanta between the electrons and the radiation field. Multiparticle effects are modeled with the density functional theory within the local density approximation for the Kohn–Sham exchange and correlation, and the Fokker–Planck formulation is used to determine the effects of scattering on the energy distribution of the electrons.}

This research is on product cost optimization projects applied by companies that follow a lean approach. The studied company, a first-tier supplier of the automotive industry, developed a cost reduction methodology to be applied in the production phase named Ratio Project Planning (RPP). This methodology was analysed from a project management perspective. To turn it more effective and efficient, a dashboard that includes the performance indicators regarding RPP was developed and implemented.

The various alternative solutions directly affect the implementation of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing as well as its benefits. However, there is currently no scientific and reasonable quantitative method to compare various options and determine the optimal solution. This paper aims to propose a decision-making method of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing based on the AHP-entropy weight and extension theory. Firstly, an evaluation criteria system of heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing is established, covering economic criteria (including remanufacturing cost and remanufacturing time) and technical performance criteria (including accuracy, reliability, processing efficiency, processing range, and ergonomics). Secondly, the decision-making model is presented to determine the optimal alternative solution for heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing based on extension theory, in which weight for each evaluation criterion is defined by a method of AHP-entropy weight. Finally, combined with the remanufacturing of a heavy-duty horizontal lathe, the proposed decision-making method is verified and analyzed. The results show that the alternative for heavy-duty machine tool remanufacturing determined by this method can obtain better comprehensive benefits and reduce the potential risk of remanufacturing for various stakeholders.}

abstract = {Acknowledgements
The authors are grateful to the men and women who participated in our Focus Groups and shared with us their very personal cancer experience. Their insight is valuable, and will inform and improve cancer care for future generations. The authors thank the Greensboro area Community Research Advocates – especially April Durr, Elvira Mebane, Marie McAdoo, Kathy Norcott, and Cindy Taylor – who assisted in the conduct of the study, including interpretation of results. They also thank Gratia Wright of First Research Group for her expertise in moderating and executing all of the focus groups, and Lindsey Haynes-Maslow for her assistance in responding to reviewer comments. The study was funded as a part of the Carolina Community Network program, funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (U01-CA114629). This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Objective
The problem of cancer health disparities is substantial. Clinical trials are widely advocated as a means of reducing disparities and bringing state-of-the-art care to the broader community, where most cancer care is delivered. This study sought to develop a better understanding of why disproportionately few African American men enroll in clinical trials given their substantial cancer burden.
Design
This study applied community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to design and conduct four focus groups of African American male cancer survivors and their caregivers in North Carolina.
Results
Among major themes, participants expressed confusion about the relationship between clinical trials, treatment, and research: signifying patient confusion and misinterpretation of common clinical trial terminology. Social norms including gender barriers and generational differences remain problematic; participants often reported that men do not talk about health issues, are unwilling to go to the doctor, and exhibit misapprehension and distrust regarding trials. Participants perceived this misunderstanding as detrimental to community health and expressed the need for more clarity in clinical trials information and a more fundamental social openness and communication about cancer detection and treatment.
Conclusion
Findings indicate the importance of clinical trial education in both traditional provider referral to trials and also in general patient navigation. To dispel pervasive misapprehension regarding placebos, clinical trial information should emphasize the role of standard care in modern cancer treatment trials. Many participants described willingness to participate in a trial upon physician recommendation, suggesting merit in improving patient-physician communication through culturally competent terminology and trial referral systems.}

The three models drawn from the literature are, respectively, a `linear independence' CE tools model, a `reciprocal interaction' CE tools model, and a `serial' CE tools plus intervening team effectiveness model. Comparison of the model tests lends support to a composite, serial multipath specification where both team effectiveness and the CE methods for increasing development process simultaneity contribute directly to project performance and mediate the contributions of other CE tools. Team effectiveness was higher for teams using CE tools and methods which standardize engineering methodologies. The use of simultaneity methods was higher for project teams using some other CE tools. CE Tools for data integration and for increased customer input made no contribution to project task performance. The model specifying an interactive synergy between the tools and methods of CE was the least successful. Most of the benefits from the tools and methods of CE can be achieved by focusing implementation effort on increasing simultaneity in the development process and improving team decision-making effectiveness.}

However, the various dimensions of quality performance and the relationship between them have received less attention from the research community. More specifically, the role of design quality has not been fully addressed in empirical studies. To address this gap we developed a path model incorporating design quality, conformance quality, external quality-in-use, product cost, time-to-market and customer satisfaction. The model was tested with data collected from 351 manufacturing companies in the Republic of Ireland. Analysis of the data indicated considerable support for the conceptual model.}

Finally, the implementation stages were proposed and effects of C2B were summarized. In addition, in the prospect of subsequent research, combining with the existing analysis and C2B projects we involved in, we will derive an overall framework of C2B.

abstract = {Supplier selection is the process of finding the right suppliers, at the right price, at the right time, in the right quantities, and with the right quality. The aim of this paper, is supplier selection in the context of supply chain risk management. Thus nine criteria of quality, on time delivery and performance history and six risks in the supply chain including supply risk, demand risk, manufacturing risk, logistics risk, information risk and environmental risk considered for evaluating suppliers. Shannon entropy is used for weighing criteria and fuzzy TOPSIS is applied for ranking suppliers. Findings show that, in the spare parts supplier selection problem, demand risk is the most important factor.}

abstract = {In the past the main processes in the introduction of a new vehicle into the market were developed by large manufacturers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and the vast majority of concurrent engineering (CE) research work was based on issues relevant to them. Today the situation has changed world-wide. Large companies outsource a great deal of high level engineering work to suppliers. This outsourcing is justified by lower costs and higher quality, and at the same time every company can use its resources in the areas it has technical expertise. However, most suppliers still follow the ‘build and break’ approach. The cost of introducing new approach such as CE, and adopting new technologies such as computer aided engineering (CAE) is substantial, as this cost adds to the operating costs and is only justifiable if it enables the development of higher quality products in less time with fewer people. The authors have examined a number of available CE frameworks and noted that these frameworks dealt with different aspects of CE in different degrees of detail. But they did not differentiate between the introduction of CE in large manufacturers on one hand and their suppliers on the other. This project is based on the recognition that a different approach to CE implementation is needed at the suppliers’ level. A three level framework has been proposed, i.e., (i) the environment in which the suppliers operate, (ii) a five stage implementation approach, and (iii) a CE tool portfolio. Implementation of the three level framework has started successfully at Tickford Engineering Ltd., which is a typical and fast growing supplier to the automotive industry.}

In this regard, environmental factors have been considered within the supplier selection process which is a major decision point in supply chains. Hence, in addition to the optimization of the traditional criteria, green criteria have also started to take its place in the supplier selection problem. In this study, an integrated methodology including the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (IF-TOPSIS) and a modified two-phase fuzzy goal programming model are proposed to better address this selection problem in a multi-item/multi-supplier/multi-period environment. The detailed steps are explicitly provided within the proposed methodology. In this respect, the criteria importance weights are determined via IF-TOPSIS which enables the opportunity to handle the vagueness within the evaluation process of decision-makers. Afterward, the obtained importance weights are used in the modified two-phase fuzzy goal programming model for selecting the best suppliers. An application in the air filter industry is performed to demonstrate the validation of the proposed methodology. Consequently, the proposed methodology successfully provides the best selection of suppliers by satisfying both classic and green criteria.}

Hence, structure of competition requires a fuzzy and multi criteria approach. The aim of this study is to determine the competition power of a corporate based on the driver analysis concept by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. In the study, firstly the factors that have affected the competition power of corporate and strategies were selected. Then factors have been classified as drivers or brakes according to the effects on the competition power of corporate. After these steps integrated, the model has been formed with performance driver analysis and AHP technique. The weight of factors has been calculated by using fuzzy number.

The requirements of a PSS often interact with each other, hence significantly influencing requirements evaluation and decision-making processes. The recent literature has proposed some methods such as fuzzy ANP and rough DEMATEL to evaluate interacting PSS requirements and to focus on requirements prioritization. However, aggregation with respect to interacting PSS requirements is seldomly considered. Alternatively, the weighted arithmetic mean method is implicitly used as the aggregation operator to aggregate PSS requirements. Hence, different effects of interactions among any subset of PSS requirements are not considered. This may result in sub-optimal alternatives being adopted for further PSS development. In order to solve this specific problem, a systematic method based on rough-fuzzy DEMATEL, 2-additive fuzzy measures, and the Choquet integral is proposed for aggregating interacting requirements for PSS development along with requirements prioritization. The proposed method utilizes the rough-fuzzy DEMATEL method to determine the weights of interacting PSS requirements when there is a group of experts providing subjective and linguistic assessments of influence strengths. By integrating the Choquet integral with 2-additive fuzzy measures, the proposed method can aggregate interacting PSS requirements non-additively by considering 2-order interactions between any two requirements. To demonstrate its feasibility and advantages, the proposed method is applied to evaluate requirement interactions for a smart wearable medical system.}

To solve this problem, this study proposes a new low-carbon design method based on a multi-layer carbon footprint information model. The hierarchical carbon footprint information model is the combination of direct structural design elements with indirect design elements such as functions and principles. The study also proposes a method for qualitative/semi-quantitative carbon footprint calculation. To achieve this, design information is combined with product structure tree (PST) to form a greenhouse gas (GHG)-product structure tree (G-PST) based on the carbon footprint design information. The influence degree (Id) of each design element in the G-PST is evaluated by the analytical network process (ANP) method and the optimizable degree (Od) of each design element for low-carbon design is obtained. The low-carbon product design is divided into four categories—structure optimization design, principle optimization design, function optimization design, and process optimization design—and the corresponding innovative design strategies are proposed. The results of this research can effectively obtain and standardize various low-carbon design elements, and provide targeted methods and tools for guiding designers to implement innovative low-carbon designs. The effectiveness of this low-carbon design method proposed is then tested on a Haier automatic washing machine, EB72M2JD.}

abstract = {The process for evaluating and selecting design alternatives is a key stage in the development of a product and can, in essence, be considered a decision-making process. In order to manage this process, Value Methodologies are considered as an important decision support tool, especially by means of the calculation of the Value Index factor, Ivf, for each one of the product functions as a representation of its ‘satisfaction’-to-cost relationship. However, given the subjective nature of the ‘satisfaction’ metric used in its calculation, the process of formulating the Value Index for the different product functions is a complex matter. In this paper, a novel expert system is described for evaluating and selecting design alternatives based on the development of a new methodology for calculating the Value Index factor. The system takes into account efficient management of the uncertainty inherent in the operations by using two concurrent fuzzy-inference processes. The first of these processes manages the determination of the Value Index factor, while the second calculates the Perceived Value factor, a term associated with the risk derived from not modifying the initial parameters in the calculation of the Value Index itself. An autonomous decision system is thus obtained that not only evaluates, selects and recommends the best design alternative, but which also determines the strength of the selection. In addition to the description of this system, a case study is presented that shows the potential benefits obtained from the new methods thus developed. These methods make it possible to improve the use of Value Indices as decision factors in the design process and also to provide new perspectives on the selection of alternatives in the context of Value Methodologies.}

Therefore, in the literature, there are various risk assessment methods utilizing various parameters. One of them is safety and critical effect analysis (SCEA) which is the method that calculates risk magnitude based on the highest number of parameters that are probability, severity, frequency, and detectability. However, the risk assessment phase includes uncertainties and inconsistencies caused by both evaluations of experts and the complex structure of the handled process. Therefore, we proposed a new risk assessment approach to cope with these uncertainties and inconsistencies by extending SCEA with the Neutrosophic sets. In this study, each parameter, probability, severity, frequency, and detectability, is defined by using truth membership function, falsity membership function, and indeterminacy membership function in Neutrosophic sets (NSs) to deal with incomplete, indeterminate, and inconsistent information existing in the expert preferences and complex structure of the handled process. It is the first time, the indeterminacy of NSs is defined based on truth and falsity definitions by using a rule-based system based on probability, severity, frequency, and detectability parameters. Furthermore, Mamdani fuzzy inference system used in the SCEA method is adapted to NSs. The proposed approach is applied to the metalworking and woodworking workshop of a university. The obtained results are compared with the results of the SCEA method. It is concluded that the proposed approach is better than SCEA method to consider inconsistencies in the risk evaluation.}

Firstly, priority values of criteria in software selection problem have been determined by using fuzzy extension of AHP method. Fuzzy extension of AHP is suggested in this paper because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures. Then, the result of the fuzzy TOPSIS model can be employed to define the most appropriate alternative with regard to this firm's goals in uncertain environment. Fuzzy numbers are presented in all phases in order to overcome any vagueness in decision making process. The final decision depends on the degree of importance of each decision maker so that wrong degree of importance causes the mistaken result. The researchers generally determine the degrees of importance of each decision maker according to special characteristics of each decision maker as subjectivity. In order to overcome this subjectivity in this paper, the judgments of decision makers are degraded to unique decision by using an attribute based aggregation technique. There is no study about software selection using integrated fuzzy AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS approach with group decision-making based on an attribute based aggregation technique. The results of the proposed approach and the other approaches are compared. Results indicate that our methodology allows decreasing the uncertainty and the information loss in group decision making and thus, ensures a robust solution to the firm.}

The samples of observation are three full Islamic banking system and 19 conventional banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) purposefully from 2004.03 – 2010.4. The result showed that Islamic Banks are superior in the achievement of technical efficiency, but the average cost efficiency is much lower than Conventional Banks. Cost inefficiency of Islamic-Banks come from allocative inefficiency.}

abstract = {A common feature of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate sustainable manufacturing is the participation (to various extents) of Decision Makers (DMs) or experts (e.g. to define the importance, or “weight”, of each criterion). This is an undesirable requirement that can be time consuming and complex, but it can also lead to disagreement between multiple DMs. Another drawback of typical MCDA methods is the limited scope of weight sensitivity analyses that are usually performed for one criterion at the time or on an arbitrary basis, struggling to show the “big picture” of the decision making space that can be complex in many real-world cases. This work removes all the mentioned shortcomings implementing automatic weighting through an ordinal combinatorial ranking of criteria objectively set by four pre-defined weight distributions. Such solution provides the DM not only with a fast, rational and systematic method, but also with a broader and more accurate insight into the decision making space considered. Additionally, the entropy of information in the criteria can be used to adjust the weights and emphasise the differences between potentially close alternatives. The proposed methodology is derived generalising a problem of material selection of automotive parts in metal casting manufacturing systems. In particular, three typical aluminium, magnesium and zinc alloys in a High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) process are compared using the deterministic Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) combining 18 criteria organised in 4 main categories (cost, quality, time and environmental sustainability). A detailed and systematic approach to calculate the considered criteria is also provided and it includes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considerations. Results show that, although in most of the cases the aluminium alloy is the best option, there are a few areas in the decision making space where magnesium and zinc alloys score better without a simple correlation to categories. This shows how valuable the proposed mapping process is to understand the complex MCDA analyses. The methodology does not make specific assumptions about metal casting and can be applied to sustainable manufacturing in general.}

The aim of this paper is to provide an exploratory analysis of the fit between existing home delivery innovative services, requirements, and issues that users might have. To do so, we review the main features of innovative services and we compare them with the findings from an online survey. For each service, we identify the value propositions, and the issues the service aims to address. In particular, four innovative services are reviewed. Through the online survey, we identify user’s habits, requirements and perceptions regarding the effectiveness and features of the innovative services.}

abstract = {Several years ago, an editorial in a software industry journal asked readers, “Why aren’t they using all those marvelous methods?” The focus of the editorial was on software engineering methods, but the question also applies to the broader realm of new product development (NPD). Proven tools exist for gathering, disseminating, and using market information. But despite widespread recognition of the important role that market knowledge plays in NPD, most firms fail to employ these tools in a consistent manner. Marjorie E. Adams, George S. Day, and Deborah Dougherty contend that the tools for successful NPD cannot be implemented successfully until we understand the barriers that hinder an organization’s capabilities for learning about markets. To foster that understanding, they describe the results of a study that explores the organizational barriers to learning about markets for new products. The study examines 40 NPD efforts in 15 large firms, and it has the following goals: identifying the processes through which organizational barriers impede market learning, developing specific ideas for how NPD professionals can cope more effectively with these barriers, and offering suggestions for improving market tools and techniques to help overcome these barriers. The study identifies three organizational learning barriers: avoiding ambiguity, compartmentalized thinking, and inertia. For the participants in this study, these barriers persistently act in specific ways to inhibit market learning. In acquiring market information, people typically focus on less ambiguous, more easily understood technologies and business truisms. Dissemination of market information is hindered because people focus on their own goals, which are often defined within their department’s role instead of the overall goals of the project. Inertia acts as a barrier to the effective use of market information. That is, people tend to proceed as they always have, maintaining the status quo rather than adjusting actions to capitalize on market learning. By encouraging broad functional participation in the acquisition and interpretation of data, NPD organizations can reduce the perceived ambiguity of market information. However, cross-functional approaches are only one step in overcoming organizational barriers. Managers must enable teams to develop rich, vivid market data, help people extend established routines into new practices, and promote trust. Specific market research tools and methods that promote market learning are also suggested.}

An integrated model which uses fuzzy-Shannon Entropy to determine the sustainability criteria weights and fuzzy-Inference system to prioritize suppliers from the individual sustainability dimensions perspective is proposed to aid in the evaluation and selection. A Pakistan manufacturing company is used to exemplify the applicability and usefulness of the proposed suppliers' sustainability performance evaluation decision framework. The results show that amongst the economic, environmental and social sustainability dimensions, three criteria, namely: ‘Quality’ (10.87%), ‘Cleaner Technology Implementation’ (11.51%) and ‘Information Disclosure’ (13.75%), respectively, are the topmost ranked criteria. Across the triple-sustainability dimensions, suppliers 3 was ranked the topmost suppliers overall. This means that, to improve the sustainability of the company's supply chain, supplier 3 is most appropriate and recommended amongst the four suppliers for partnership. Managerial implications, limitations and further research directions are discussed.}

The success of a mechatronics engineering program is directly related to the structural design methodology, modeling and simulation, and the practical implementation of fully integrated physical systems. In this paper a mechatronics design education-oriented V-model was proposed to fulfill these requirements. The main idea behind our proposed approach aims to integrate various stages such as design, simulation and physical implementations in development of mechatronics product or system. Students are asked to first follow the structural design methodology to do the conceptual and further detail design for an open-ended problem, then to do appropriate simulation to verify the feasibility of the design, and at last to integrate all components and subsystems into a complete physical product or system. The V-model-related courses and structures were explained in detail, and project implementation experiences were described and discussed with the help of example student projects.}

However, SMEs face considerable barriers such as difficulties in financing international activity, identifying opportunities and making appropriate contacts in their target markets. This paper investigates the adherence of both lean and green practices for the development of new products (NPD), as means to improve their efficiency (lean perspective) and manufacture environment-friendly products (green perspective). Through a systemic review, we present 16 lean and green enablers for NPD operations. These elements comprise a structure of building blocks to evaluate lean and green practices. Thus, we propose a model that ranks the incidence of these practices regardless of the NPD organization level. Using two MCDM tools: AHP and fuzzy-TOPSIS, each enabler is evaluated considering the SMEs context in Brazil. Firstly, AHP defines the relative importance of six SMEs' characteristics. Secondly, we applied an expansion of the TOPSIS technique, adequate when the values of each alternative are not clearly determined. Therefore, we organized a structured interview consisting of 96 evaluation questions for NPD stakeholders. We carried out this diagnosis in three companies from southern Brazil, analysing their NPD operations, which is useful to establish a future improvement agenda.}
