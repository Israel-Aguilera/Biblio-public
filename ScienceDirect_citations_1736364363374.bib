abstract = {This article discusses issues and solutions regarding traceability for Systems Engineering projects. A review of industrial Systems Engineering practice is presented based on observations and studies that have been carried out at different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The studies reveal challenges in communication, data-transparency and data-consistency resulting among others from diverse and inhomogeneous toolsets. Existing traceability solutions, which are one possibility to address these challenges, struggle to achieve satisfactory cost/benefit ratios. Thus, further improvements of existing approaches with new concepts and ideas are required. The article presents a morphological schema for traceability approaches. Its aim is to support attribute recombination to new research solutions and to overcome existing problems with naming conventions. The application of the schema is shown at the example of two novel approaches from Fraunhofer IPK and Daimler AG which are focusing on issues in trace link recording within Systems Engineering projects. The implementation, evaluation and functional comparison for both approaches are presented based on an exemplary automotive system. First results show a significant reduction of required trace recording efforts and good acceptance from engineers in the automotive industry. The developed schema and the two approaches contribute to the establishment of traceability for process improvement in future Systems Engineering projects.}

abstract = {Design alternative evaluation in the early stages of engineering design plays an important role in determining the success of new product development, as it influences considerably the subsequent design activities. However, existing approaches to design alternative evaluation are overly reliant on experts’ ambiguous and subjective judgments and qualitative descriptions. To reduce subjectivity and improve efficiency of the evaluation process, this paper proposes a quantitative evaluation approach through data-driven performance predictions. In this approach, the weights of performance characteristics are determined based on quantitative assessment of expert judgments, and the ranking of design alternatives is achieved by predicting performance values based on historical product design data. The experts’ subjective and often vague judgments are captured quantitatively through a rough number based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. In order to facilitate performance based quantitative ranking of alternatives at the early stages of design where no performance calculation is possible, a particle swarm optimization based support vector machine (PSO-SVM) is applied for historical data based performance prediction. The final ranking of alternatives given the predicted values of multiple performance characteristics is achieved through Višekriterijumska Optimizacija I kompromisno Rešenje (VIKOR). A case study is carried out to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.}

A multiple case study approach was used to explore how the lean production model has been adopted by 27 excellent firms operating in international markets and to recognize the areas characterized by major problems and difficulties. A research model, able to accurately define and operationalize the lean production concept, was developed in order to carry out this empirical study. The model represents a conceptualization of lean production as consisting of a number of improvement programmes or best practices characterizing different areas of the company (i.e. process and equipment, manufacturing planning and control, human resources, product design, supplier relationships, customer relationships). Results from this study would suggest that for a full implementation of lean production principles, the most critical factor appears to be the management of external relationships rather than internal operations. The challenge, today, is how to integrate the different organizations into the value stream in order to ensure excellence in final products and services and, also, how to integrate customers into the organization. This calls for a change in the perspective of analysis: the focus must move from operations management to relationships management. In the light of this, suggestions for future research, indicated by the empirical findings, are offered.}

Even though the research on various types of collaborations between firms is abundant, the research that provides a mathematical model for the selection of the most appropriate relationship form is very limited. The main objective in this study is to base on an electronic components manufacturer in Taiwan to propose an analytical approach to evaluate the forms of buyer–supplier relationship between the manufacturer and its supplier. A model, which applies the analytic network process (ANP) and the benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR) concept, is constructed to consider various aspects of buyer–supplier relationships. Multiple factors that affect the success of the relationship are analyzed by incorporating experts’ opinions on their priority of importance, and a performance ranking of the buyer–supplier forms is obtained. The results shall provide guidance to select the most appropriate form of relationship between the manufacturer and its supplier. The proposed model is systematic, and it is easy to be understood and applied by the management. The model can be tailored and applied by firms in various industries that are making decisions on buyer–supplier relationship.}

abstract = {Capturing the uncertainty associated with a decision maker (DM)’s judgments and preferences is one of the most challenging parts of concept design evaluation as it depends on subjective linguistic terms. To address this drawback, we propose a novel approach for concept design evaluation that incorporates Z-number and axiomatic design (AD) concepts. Although pertinent literature advocates for the capture of uncertain information originating from DMs, the relevant need for information reliability has not been addressed. By incorporating Z-numbers, the confidence level of a decision or its reliability is taken into consideration, thus a more comprehensive perception of the DM is recorded. Then, these judgments and preferences are incorporated to AD to select the best design concept. Using data from the published literature, a case study is conducted to assess the impact of information reliability and the DM’s risk attitude with regards to available design options. The proposed approach is also compared with previously developed methods in order to show its benefits. The results demonstrate that the reliability of the information has a significant impact on final results; and assessment of confidence, or reliability of information, enhances the success for better decision-making.}

These interventions are based on the “pulling levers” deterrence strategy that focuses criminal justice and social service attention on a small number of chronically offending gang members responsible for the bulk of urban gun violence problems. Unfortunately, there is relatively little rigorous evaluation evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches to violence prevention. In Stockton, California, an interagency task force implemented a pulling levers strategy to prevent gun homicide among gang-involved offenders. A U.S. Department of Justice-sponsored impact evaluation suggests that the pulling levers strategy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the monthly number of gun homicide incidents in Stockton. A comparative analysis of gun homicide trends in Stockton relative to other midsize California cities also supports a unique program effect associated with the pulling levers intervention.}

In the situation of incomplete information, treating the attributes, which may be relevant to some rules and not to others, as “missing” ones is found to cause reasoning problems. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, i.e. the disparate attributes algorithm, for managing semantic assembly design rules. The proposed disparate attributes algorithm by identifying “inapplicable” information extends a rough set approach for managing semantic assembly design rules with systematic selection of various minimal sets of rules. To validate the disparate attributes algorithm, the approach is tested with multiple realistic assembly design cases.}

In order to effectively and efficiently implement IP management, it is more practical to firstly focus on the most important aspects which, in turn, provide immediate beneficial results to allow organizations to further implementing other aspects by allocating more resources. The authors propose an IP management excellence audit system that breaks down the complicated IP management practices into a list of enabling criteria and the IP management performance in various criteria can be measured in details. The enabling criteria are the critical success factors to good IP management system and practice. Analytic hierarchy process approach is used to determine the relative importance among the identified criteria in the IP management excellence audit system. The evidential reasoning approach is adopted to develop an expert assessment tool to carry out the audit of organizations’ performance in IP management. Based on the audit results, organizations will know the strength and weakness of their current IP management practice and can allocate resources and efforts in priority area for improvement. The authors have validated the developed system and tool in HK–Guangdong (HK–GD) based manufacturing organizations with satisfactory outcome. The audit results are helpful to provide top management facts and information to develop action plans for improving IP management.

Some conclusions about the impact of parameters on the optimal number of FLSPs are proposed with numerical analysis.

The hypothesized stages are (i) traditional hunter-gatherer society, (ii) exploitive colonization, settlement and commercialization, (iii) wood resource protection, (iv) multiple use management, and finally, (v) sustainable forest management or ecosystem management. The developmentalist model of change presented here reveals a striking similarity in the stages or eras that these countries experienced in the struggle to manage public forest estates. Changing community values and economic circumstances produced similar stages in several countries. The details of policies and legislation may differ, the terminology may be different, even some stages may be missing, but the trajectory of change remains similar.}

abstract = {The basic premise of this study is that suppliers, in order to compete successfully in the marketplace, have to develop certain innovative capabilities that, in turn, depend on the type of relationship that is established with customers (in other words, the strategic role assumed by the supplier in the supply chain). Based on a study of 198 suppliers operating in the food packaging machinery industry, structural equation modelling has revealed that customers actually assign suppliers different roles and give them varying levels of responsibility in the product development and manufacturing stages. These roles are correlated to the supplier's distinctive innovation capabilities. Clustering analysis is used to divide the suppliers into homogeneous groups. Innovative capabilities are not only associated with traditional competencies in R&D and product/process innovation but also in supportive capabilities in the form of absorptive capacity, technological scanning, innovation-oriented culture, skills and know-how of individuals and managerial practices. The impact of different innovative capabilities (both technological and managerial) on critical performance factors such as price, quality, time and flexibility is measured for each type of supplier in turn. The research findings lend support to the hypothesis that the level of investment in technology and the acquisition of specific managerial capabilities are, to a large extent, a determinant of supplier–customer interdependence.}

abstract = {Evaluating suppliers and supporting their continuous improvement have become critical for supply chain (SC) performance management. Since the performance of an organization in a SC depends on the performance of its suppliers, it is desirable that the evaluation of a supplier can be integrated to the evaluation of the SC. Few studies propose decision making models to aid the supplier evaluation for development. However, these studies adopt criteria similar to ones used in supplier selection, which can lead to a mismatch between supplier and SC performance evaluations. Therefore, to overcome this lack of alignment, this article presents a new approach that uses the performance metrics of the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model to evaluate the suppliers in the dimensions cost and delivery performance. It combines two fuzzy TOPSIS models for evaluating and categorizing the suppliers in four groups depending on their performance evaluation. According to their categorization, directives for action plans are proposed. An illustrative application was developed based on a manufacturing context. The combination between the SCOR® and fuzzy TOPSIS brings several benefits when compared with other approaches, such as: it facilitates the integration of the processes of performance evaluation of the suppliers and the SC; it enables benchmarking against other SCs; the fuzzy TOPSIS requires few judgments to parameterization, which contributes to the agility of the decision process; it does not limit the number of alternatives simultaneously evaluated; it does not cause the ranking reversal problem when a new supplier is included in the evaluation process.}

abstract = {In the light of intensifying competition, growing customer needs and requirements, and bigger awareness of environmental impact, entrepreneurs are looking for new ways to improve and develop their operations. Currently available business models based on sales and the transfer of ownership rights to products from a manufacturer to the user, which do not include any additional services, do not create a possibility for the customer to fully exploit the products. After some time, machinery sold under such an arrangement ceases to be used and those who bought it have problems with selling the machinery and recovering capital frozen in it. Therefore, seeking new business models seems extremely important as they may improve customer satisfaction and experience with the way products are offered to them and, at the same time, bring a number of benefits to entrepreneurs. One of possible solutions to the above-mentioned issues is the PSS model, which allows selling the accessibility and functions offered by products and their re-use. This publication is an attempt to develop such a model for the printing industry. To this end, questionnaire-based studies were conducted in 80 printing houses from which we learned how printing machines are used and about the needs and problems faced by entrepreneurs. Results of analyses suggest there are deep differences between small, medium-sized, and large printing companies as to the services in which these categories of businesses are interested. Profound analyses conducted for industries to whom PSS design methods are addressed, industrial PSS cases, questionnaire-based studies, statistical analyses, and consultations with experts from different fields helped in developing a new PSS model whose detailed structure, in particular for the printing industry, have never been broadly commented, studied or evidenced so far. This paper is intended to bridge this gap. The approach to the subject is also innovative as it is based on questionnaire-based studies which correctly reflect market reality. Moreover, all services tied to machines have been selected following in-depth statistical analyses and the proposed approach is unusually comprehensive as it covers micro, small, medium-sized, and large enterprises.}

Fuzzy logic, and tools based on fuzzy logic, allow for the inclusion of uncertainties and imperfect information in decision making models, making them well suited for manufacturing decisions. In this study, we first review the progression in the use of fuzzy tools in tackling different manufacturing issues during the past two decades. We then apply fuzzy linear programming to a less emphasized, but important issue in manufacturing, namely that of product mix prioritization. The proposed algorithm, based on linear programming with fuzzy constraints and integer variables, provides several advantages to existing algorithm as it carries increased ease in understanding, in use, and provides flexibility in its application.}

abstract = {Due to intensification of market competence and customers increasing socio-environmental concerns, sustainability has become a focal point for most organizations. Thus incorporation of customer sustainable expectations into the conventional supplier selection process has become necessary for manufacturers to sustain in the competitive market. To cope with this issue, it is necessary to model the customers’ opinions and expectations into the strategic supplier selection and order allocation decision making, an area not delved upon much in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the study is to develop an analytical model for manufacturing firm for selection of suppliers based on customers’ expectations which are reflected as retailers’ expectation level and also for bringing in financial and socio-environmental stability to the whole SC. The research methodology adopted involves 1) use of fuzzy-TOPSIS technique using Z numbers for evaluation of suppliers based on traditional as well as social environmental attributes which reflect customer's social and green expectations, 2) development of a novel bi-objective mathematical model for selecting suppliers meeting the expectation levels, allocating orders proportionate to the performance scores of the suppliers, rewarding or penalizing the suppliers as per their sustainable performance, 3) Transformation of the bi-objective model into a weighted goal programming model for attaining a trade-off solution between the objectives of minimization of cost and maximization of sustainable value of purchase. To exemplify the efficacy of the model, case of electronics sector is presented. The findings of the result suggest that penalty and reward value incorporated in the cost objective system is effective in enhancing the sustainable performance of the suppliers and can prove to be an effective strategy for DMs. The study recommends that the proposed mathematical model can considerably aid the manufacturer in integrating supplier selection and order allocation decisions while optimizing the performance of the customer oriented supply chain.}

abstract = {With the rise in competition levels and rapid changes in customer preferences, companies feel the pressure to create an efficient and effective base of suppliers in order to achieve the competitive advantage for them. The selection parameters of suppliers do not remain constant with respect to time and moreover; with highly fluctuating market demand, the suppliers are also expected to respond to it dynamically. This paper addresses a specific dynamic supplier selection problem (DSSP) under a two-echelon supply network (TESN) for the decision maker to allocate optimum order quantities to different levels of suppliers. The problem here considers a TESN with an integrated approach where the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) selects the first-tier suppliers and in turn with their opinion decides for the second-tier suppliers. Second-tier suppliers supply raw materials/parts/components to the first-tier suppliers, and then the first-tier suppliers supply the fabricated semi-finished product to OEM. In order to solve such a kind of problem, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) is proposed to minimize the Total Cost (TC) of procurement for satisfying the OEM's demand. The problem incorporates parameters relevant to supplier's capacity, lead time, quality level of products, and transportation costs as a function of lead time. The model is validated through two cases with randomly generated data, and sensitivity analysis is conducted through Taguchi method using LINGO 15. This method not only helps to check the robustness of the parameters involved but also to set their optimum level. The analysis shows a significant reduction in the TC of procurement and the effect of each parameter on the TC are finally identified. The methodology adopted here can be extended to other organizations.}

abstract = {The so-called smart manufacturing systems (SMS) combine smart manufacturing technologies, cyber-physical infrastructures, and data control to realize predictive and adaptive behaviours. In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality.}

A hybridized reflectivity method is developed and used to compute a 1D synthetic seismogram for a geologic section which consists of a series of layers with one of the layers consisting of fractures. Seismic attributes, notably instantaneous amplitude, frequency and bandwidth are computed for a reflected seismic energy from a fractured zone with known distribution of fracture parameters: fracture length, aperture and spacing. The permeability of the fractured zone is computed using a discrete fracture model. The synthetic seismogram is computed using the Modified Displacement Discontinuity Model (MDD), which accounts for fracture opening and finite lengths of fractures. A significant correlation is established between the seismic attributes and fractured rock mass permeability. All the seismic attributes tend to increase with increase in permeability. The correlation is significant enough to establish a meaningful empirical relation between seismic attributes and fracture permeability.}

A major bromobenzene metabolite, p-bromophenol at a similar dose did not significantly alter hepatic glutathione levels compared to controls. Twenty four hr after administration, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels were significantly increased by bromobenzene but not by p-bromophenol. After 14C-bromobenzene administration, a significant amount of covalently bound radiolabel was detected in liver, kidney and small intestine. A small amount of covalently bound radiolabel was also detected in the lung. After a similar dose of 14C-bromophenol, covalently bound radiolabel was found in liver (62% of the amount detected with 14C-bromobenzene) and smaller amounts were detected in kidney, small intestine and lung. These data are consistent with the view that the hepatotoxity and glutathione depleting ability of bromobenzene are mediated mainly by bromobenzene-3, 4-oxide rather than by chemically reactive metabolites of p-bromophenol derived from bromobenzene. Covalently bound radiolabel from 14C-bromobenzene, however, may be derived from both bromobenzene-3, 4-oxide and the nontoxic reactive metabolites of p-bromophenol.}

However, platelet spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins, the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK and proteins of 101 and 105 kD (pp101 and pp105), require a second adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-dependent costimulatory event. In this study we show that protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK, pp101 and pp105, and abolished spreading. These inhibitory effects were not observed after treatment of the platelets with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. This suggested that in platelets, PKC regulates spreading and related protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the inhibitory effects of apyrase, an ADP scavenger, on spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK, pp101, and pp105, were not observed in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). These data implied that in fibrinogen-adherent platelets integrin ligation and an agonist receptor occupancy are required for the functional association of PKC and the αIIbβ3-mediated signaling pathways. Taken together these results show that PKC plays a central role in the transduction of intracellular signals downstream from αIIbβ3 that regulate spreading and pp125FAK phosphorylation.}

abstract = {Evaluating and selecting a suitable supplier is a complex problem which involves a number of different criteria. In literature, there are various multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods available with their own characteristic features. The focus of this study is intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) MCDM methods which have attracted much attention from academics and practitioners in recent years. IF sets are widely used to tackle imprecise and uncertain decision information in decision making due to their capability of accommodating the hesitation in human decision processes. This study proposes a new integrated methodology that is used for the first time in the literature. This approach consists of intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IFAHP), an MCDM technique, for determining the weights of supplier evaluation criteria, and the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy axiomatic design (IFAD) principles for ranking competing supplier alternatives with respect to their overall performance. Decision makers’ assessments and opinions are extended to the IF environment in this approach and furthermore, the group decision making (GDM) approach is utilized in order to overcome uncertainties and vagueness, minimize the partiality of decision process and to avoid bias. This study contributes to supplier selection and IF sets literature by providing a combined framework based on IFAHP and IFAD methodology for the first time. To assess the validity of the proposed integrated IF MCDM approach, a case study from Turkey is provided. This study can be useful to researchers in better understanding the supplier selection problem theoretically, as well as to organizations in designing better satisfying supplier evaluation systems.}

abstract = {Sustainability of agro-food supply chains has recently become the subject of greater interest from consumers, firms, governmental organizations and academia as the environment continues to deteriorate. One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (1) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment.}

There are many solutions to assist manufacturing systems for this purpose. Computerized systems and their related solutions were being the most attractive ones for manufacturing systems in recent decade. Developing such systems and exploiting from the advantages of such solutions requires a consistent foundation. Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) emerged as a philosophy to provide such foundation, and to assist the computerized manufacturing solutions. Despite of the high potentials of the CIM philosophy, the related works lack in many aspects. The absence of a thorough look to exploit the high potentials of the CIM philosophy to consider different aspects of the manufacturing systems, and the complexity which exists in the nature of the designing of such systems are the major concerns. These concerns lead us to afford them fundamentally with an architectural view. The architectural view of the paper is because of architectures are the basis for designing and future development of the systems, and synthesizing solutions that satisfy the system requirements. Accordingly, the architecture of the system is considered as a basis for creating desired changes and resolving the mentioned concerns. Therefore, the paper proposes a layered architecture which covers five critical aspects of a CIM system. Physical, Functional, Managerial, Informational, and Control aspects are the five critical aspects which are assigned to five layers of the architecture. The manipulated architecture assists manufacturing systems to audit their Physical, Functional, Managerial, Informational, and Control aspects based on a proposed set of ISO standards in order to compatibilize and align themselves with the necessities of the globalized manufacturing industry. The layered architecture expected to be well-structured and to resolve the concerns. The expectations have been investigated through a promising tool for designing and analyzing complex systems, known as Axiomatic Design (AD) Theory. The AD-based design and analysis are according to two axioms, known as Independence Axiom and Information Axiom. Moreover, the AD Theory approaches have been used to reach a set of standard guidelines for exploring and achieving realization operands for the architecture. By analyzing the results with the AD Theory axioms, appropriateness of the design has been approved. Finally, a roadmap for future works is delineated.}

Empirically, we focus on the town of Hanover, New Hampshire, during the 2014 United States General Election. Voters in Hanover initially authenticate themselves to election officials, mark their ballots in secret, and finally insert said ballots into optical scan tabulating machines. These steps are reasonably generic, and thus the way we study Hanover voters is generalizable to the study of voters in democracies across the world. Our simulations show that line voting evolution can be studied after a simple data-collection plan is implemented, and we show how scholars and election officials can evaluate the effects of changing precinct resources, like the numbers of voter authentication stations and voting booths, on the formation and duration of voting lines.}

Agile manufacturing requires enriching of the customer, co-operating with competitors, organizing to manage change, uncertainty and complexity, and leveraging people and information. In the recent years, a number of research papers have been published in the area of AM. However, a framework for the development of AM has not received due attention from both researchers and practitioners. Realizing the importance of agile manufacturing in the 21st century manufacturing competitiveness, an attempt has been made in this paper to review the literature available on AM with the objective to: (i) identify key strategies and techniques of AM, (ii) suggest some future research directions and (iii) develop a framework for the development of agile manufacturing systems (AMSs) along four key dimensions which include strategies, technologies, systems and people.}

The resulting Nash equilibria reflect strategies in which each player makes its optimal decision, taking into account the optimal decision of the other players. A sensitivity analysis of the effects of the parameters on the performance measures of price and profit provide intuitively sound results, and demonstrates how a common ground can be found between two schools of thought on buyer-supplier relations.}

The composite which was fabricated by stir casting method possessed superior properties due to an effective bonding between matrix and reinforcement particles. The fabricated composite specimens were subjected to various tests to determine the mechanical properties such as density, porosity, hardness and tensile strength. The results were compared with basic matrix alloy. Furthermore, the OM, SEM with EDAX and XRD analyses were carried out to analyze the dispersion of the reinforced particles in the selected matrix alloy. It was observed that the homogeneous distribution of BLA particles in composites was intragranular in nature. Moreover, it was also observed that BLA particles were well bonded with matrix alloy with clear interface. It was also found that the density decreased with increase in mass fraction of BLA particles and porosity increased with increase in mass fraction of BLA particles. The hardness and tensile strength were increased up to 4% of BLA in the composite, with a further increase in BLA content the hardness and tensile strength decreased.}

abstract = {The Indian electronics industry is facing immense pressure to include sustainability practices in order to meet customer expectations, comply with legislation and create an edge over competitors. This growing need for inclusion of sustainability is driving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to collaborate with third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) to sustainably manage returns. Collaboration with 3PRLP will put OEMs in a stronger position regarding compliance with government legislation, improving upon their corporate image and customer satisfaction. It is a win-win situation for the OEM. On the other hand, from the 3PRLP's point of view, it is important to know the capabilities of the OEMs before entering into a collaborative endeavour. Hence, it is firstly necessary to identify the most appropriate attributes of the manufacturer which are essential for a sustainable collaboration. In this context, the study proposes a novel framework for investigating the performance attributes of the OEMs from the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Since the evaluation of each attribute for each dimension of sustainability differs in terms of the nature of the information needed and the time and resources required, it is necessary to conduct a pre-evaluation of the attributes using the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method. Furthermore, the shortlisted attributes for each sustainability dimension are evaluated and prioritized using the best worst method (BWM). The novelty of the attribute selection process lies in simultaneously considering the degree of importance of the attribute as well as the degree of difficulty of the collection of data required for the assessment of the OEM. The result of this study helps decision-makers and practitioners to comprehend the most influential attributes of OEMs which are crucial for collaboration, thus enhancing the overall sustainability impact of the supply chain. The managerial implications drawn from the resulting analysis provide the 3PRLP with a sustainable evaluation framework which can be ideally used for the selection of collaborative partners. The above model is validated using the case of an Indian 3PRLP company that handles electronic products.}

QATs audit organizations at different locations with varying auditing requirements in order to evaluate an organization's own quality system (first party part audits according to IEC9001 Clause 8.2.2). The QAT consists of a lead auditor and one or more auditors that have the required skills in varying levels for the execution of an audit. For a successful audit, the formation of a QAT is vital since each audit team must at least fulfill the minimum requirements and skills needed for a specific audit. In this case study, a fuzzy mathematical-programming model and a solution algorithm based on “simulated annealing” is proposed for the formation of QATs. This is one of the first attempts in the literature to form this kind of teams analytically. Example problems are also solved in the paper to present the application of the proposed approach.}

Alignment of the MRP3 and E2 sequences showed that the similarity extends through the entire MRP3 sequence and that MRP3 is most closely ralated to the E2p subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with 54% identical residues and a further 36% that are conservatively substituted. Other features of the MRP3 gene and protein are also consistent with it being the acyltransferase subunit of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.

The small volumes and masses, the versatile purpose, as well as the fast development time associated with a potential high return-to-cost ratio are at the origin of the increasing number of new mission proposals, also beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The purpose of this study is to assess the CubeSats ability to complement an interplanetary scientific mission. The proposed AIDA (Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment) mission, an ESA/NASA joint effort to demonstrate the kinetic impact technique to change the motion of an asteroid in space, has been selected as case study, having a mission context particularly suitable in showing CubeSats supporting capabilities. The feasibility study of a mission involving the use of CubeSats as secondaries for technology demonstration and science purposes was performed. Mission objectives and requirements were defined, followed by the development of concepts of operations and mission architectures proposals. Eventually, multiple trade-off tools were adopted to define the proposed mission baseline, which involves the deployment of two 3U CubeSats performing a detachment to achieve the final configuration of one 2U and four 1U CubeSats. The scientific campaign conducted by the CubeSats includes gravitational and magnetic field mapping, on-surface chemical-physical measurements via multiple wide chip-size-sensor nets deployed from orbit, on-surface seismic measurements via landing of the 2U CubeSat, direct observation of the impact from multiple viewpoints and evaluation of the asteroid's orbit deflection due to the impact. The mission proposed involves also some important technological demonstrators. The S-iEPS (Scalable-ion Electrospray Propulsion System) has been considered as propulsion system, while a potential landing system has been proposed to achieve the soft touchdown of the 2U CubeSat. Finally, an inter-satellite communication link via laser has been included as main communication system. The proposed mission baseline has shown that CubeSats can be successfully integrated as multi-platform systems to provide useful support to interplanetary missions. This solution may enable the capability to acquire more detailed information with the possibility to combine them to obtain better results with respect to single-platform systems. The proposed mission concept represents a valuable low-cost piggyback solution adaptable to several mission contexts, with a potential high return and a remarkable attitude for the implementation and testing of new technologies and operations. In this context, this study provides a useful framework for the design and development of interplanetary CubeSats missions.}

Freshly isolated freeze-fractured mitochondria show smooth fracture faces with particles, representing the limiting membranes. The frequency and size of the particles is representative for the various membrane faces. Distinctly large particles and pits represent the attachment sites of cristae to the inner membrane. Liposome-like structures in the matrix are found upon incubation with Ca2+ and Mn2+. At 5 mM Mn2+ and more, curved hexagonal (HII) phase tubes are observed. Subsequent addition of 1 mM EDTA results in disappearance of the HII tubes, and liposomal structures can again be seen. These findings are interpreted in terms of an Mn2+-induced lamellar to HII phase transition. Patchwork-like structures characterize the membranes of mitochondria, quenched from 37°C, as well as those incubated with Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+ and apo- or cytochrome c. This phenomenon is interpreted as being the result of the fracture plane, jumping from the outer to the inner limiting membrane and vice versa at sites of contact. A semi-fusion model, in which non-bilayer lipids are involved, is proposed for these contact sites.}

Only a few of these models adopted hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Obtaining reliable criteria weights in these models is complicated. They lack the consideration of grey uncertainty. Thus, this study is the first to propose a hybrid model for selecting a set of LM tools based on their effect on sustainability. This model combines the best-worst method (BWM) for weighting the criteria and the grey technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (Grey-TOPSIS) method to rank the alternatives and address the grey uncertainty problem. A set of sustainability metrics (selection criteria) was determined based on a literature review and expert evaluation to prioritize a set of LM tools. An Iraqi cement company was utilized to evaluate the proposed model. The ranking results showed that the value stream mapping (VSM) tool was the most important, whereas the single-minute exchange of die (SMED) tool was the least important. The rankings of the remaining LM tools ranged between these two tools depending on their effects on sustainability. The study conducted a sensitivity analysis using three strategies that verified the model’s robustness and reliability. This research provides 16 applicable sustainability metrics and 12 LM tools that could function as a knowledge foundation for future research. It can help researchers and manufacturers maximize sustainability performance by delivering a hybrid MCDM model to select the appropriate LM tools.}

To avoid these sanctions, some colleges have chosen not to participate in federal loan programs by excluding loans from students' financial aid packages. In this article, I investigate the student-level impacts associated with the decision of community colleges to opt out of the Stafford loan program. Utilizing administrative records from over 50 community colleges located in a single state, I estimate the within-college differences in outcomes for Pell-eligible students before and after an institution opts out of the federal loan program. I find that Pell-eligible students enrolling when the community college offered federal loans were 7.6 percentage points more likely to borrow than Pell-eligible students who enrolled when the institutions opted out. Overall borrowing also increased by $368 a year. I also find that students borrowing a loan attempted 19 additional credits in their first year of enrollment and were more likely to attempt and complete math and science courses than non-borrowers.}

More than nearly 5000 cryptocurrencies are traded daily at cryptocurrency exchanges, and one of the primary challenges is the optimal selection of the assets. While research studies considered cryptocurrency price prediction as a typical time series forecasting problem, a portfolio allocation problem can be defined as a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. To tackle this problem and generate a response to these dynamic challenges, this study developed an analytical and predictive approach to guide investors through their decisions. Time series forecasting was conducted using the Prophet Forecasting Model (PFM) to predict the prices. For the asset allocation stage, this study extended the Cluster analysis for improving the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (CLUS-MCDA) algorithm by adding additional features to this large-scale decision-making technique, including Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and the Višekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje (meaning: multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution) (VIKOR) methods. While the concept of Parallel Decision Making (PDM) in massive structured problems was previously introduced in the CLUS-MCDA algorithm, this study also utilized a target-based normalization technique that gives the decision-makers more control over the extended CLUS-MCDA II algorithm. To validate the reliability of the method, a cryptocurrency trade experiment considering more than 70 cryptocurrencies and multiple scenarios based on decision-makers' preferences was analysed. The outcomes of this study showed that the proposed decision support system is a reliable tool for such practical and real-world big data problems.}

In this study, it was paid attention for considering real constraints of firms such as capital, time etc. to prevent nan-fatal failure modes (FMs), interactions between FMs and risk level similarities created by risk factors (RFs). At the first stage of the proposed approach, RFs’ weights are computed by a new intuitionistic fuzzy weighting method considering similarities between RFs for risk levels that they can create. At the second stage, Modified Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi Attribute Border Approximation Area (MIF-MABAC) including interactions between FMs is used to determine the rankings of FMs by using Extended Haussdorff distance function. At the third stage, two intuitionistic fuzzy mathematical models are established to show the effect of the real constraints of the firm to identify the risk types (RTs) that must be avoided primarily. It was seen that the first model gives the same ranking results with the MIF-MABAC. Additionally, when including the real constraints, the first model can give the more suitable results than the second model. The results obtained from the first model show that experts’ assessments and mathematical modeling identify the same FMs for preventing primarily. This study is the first one to suggest a new RA approach that reflects the real constraints of the firms to RA. Additionally, this is the first study that models’ interactions between FMs and risk level similarities created by RFs.}

TS is considered a hazardous waste by-product posing a significant environmental challenge. However, TS can be utilized for energy or resource recovery by considering it as biomass and implementing the circular economy (CE) concept. Therefore, this study aims to develop an innovative DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response) framework for promoting sustainable valorization of TS. Further, the study extends to quantify the importance of subjective DPSIR factors by offering interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number-based best worst method (IVIFN-BWM), which is relatively new in the literature and able to deal with the uncertainty, inconsistency, imprecise, and vagueness in the decision-making process. The study also investigates the most appropriate TS valorization technologies concerning identified DPSIR factors using a novel IVIFN-combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) approach. This research contributes to the literature by developing a comprehensive solution approach that combines the DPSIR framework, IVIFN-BWM, and IVIFN-CoCoSo method in addressing sustainability and resource recovery challenges for the tannery industry. The research findings highlight the potential of sustainable valorization of TS in reducing the waste amount and promoting sustainability and CE practices in the tannery industry. The findings indicated that response factors ‘creation of national-level policies and awareness campaign’ and ‘facilitating financial support to adopt waste valorization technologies’ received the highest priority among other DPSIR factors for managing and fostering sustainable valorization of TS. The IVIFN-CoCoSo analysis confirmed that the most promising TS valorization technology is ‘gasification’, which is followed by pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and incineration. The study's implications extend to policymakers, industrial practitioners, and researchers, who can leverage the research findings to develop more sustainable TS management practices in the tannery industry.}

ADNDP is a real-world and large-scale problem for which scientific decision making methods do not exist. We propose a methodology that uses multi-objective mathematical modeling, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) to solve the problem. The multi-objective mathematical model determines the locations and the service assignments of depots considering two objectives, namely, to minimize transportation costs and to minimize risk scores of main depot locations. The risk score of a depot location indicates how vulnerable the location is to disruptions and is determined by a combined AHP-TOPSIS analysis where TOPSIS is used to compute the risk scores and AHP is used to compute the weights needed by TOPSIS for the identified risk attributes. The GIS analysis is conducted to determine the potential depot locations using map layers based on spatial criteria. We have applied the proposed methodology in designing and evaluating a real ammunition distribution network under different scenarios in collaboration and cooperation with the area experts. We have employed the weighted-sum method to find non-dominated solutions for each scenario and discussed their tradeoffs with the area experts.

However, while previous studies for technology planning have focused on analyzing the potential of technology, they have not considered the customer-perceived value that technology can create in a new product. Therefore, this research suggests a new approach to assessing the level of technology and evaluating R&D projects, by investigating customer-perceived value on technology through the use of the structural equation model and opinion mining. For this, the assessment framework is developed in terms of technology, product quality, and customer satisfaction, respectively, by investigating a variety of databases on each factor. The relationship between technology level and customer satisfaction is analyzed, using structural equation model and opinion mining. Based on the results, a strategy for technology development is established through gap analysis and simulation, after selecting and evaluating technologies that need to be developed. The proposed approach is applied to the real case of a moving system, in particular an automobile door, and we obtained that an R&D project for hinge-related technology would be promising, enhancing the customer satisfaction. It can suggest a future direction for new technology development. This paper contributes to enhancing the efficiency of technology planning based on the customer-perceived value, enabling the launch of new R&D projects.}

abstract = {The member selection problem is an important aspect of the formation of cross-functional teams (CFTs). Selecting suitable members from a set of candidates will facilitate the successful task accomplishment. In the existing studies of member selection, the individual performance concerning a single candidate is mostly used, whereas the collaborative performance associating with a pair of candidates is overlooked. In this paper, as a solution to this problem, we propose a method for member selection of CFTs, where both the individual performance of candidates and the collaborative performance between candidates are considered. In order to select the desired members, firstly, a multi-objective 0–1 programming model is built using the individual and collaborative performances, which is an NP-hard problem. To solve the model, we develop an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (INSGA-II). Furthermore, a real example is employed to illustrate the suitability of the proposed method. Additionally, extensive computational experiments to compare INSGA-II with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are conducted and much better performance of INSGA-II is observed.}

Within this framework, the optimization of the supply chain is evaluated by considering the performance of both stages and guaranteeing their profitability through a coordination mechanism based on profit-sharing. Two mixed integer nonlinear programming models are presented under different lot-sizing policies to determine the optimal set of selected suppliers, retail price, and order quantity and number of orders per order cycle for each selected supplier. The structure of the models' solutions is examined by deriving properties of the optimal supplier selection and order quantity allocation scheme. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models.}

In recent article the author assumes that the amount of tool material removed from the contact zone is the result of diffusion dissolving and material transfers due to displacement of work material along tool, similar to convecting heat transfer. Obtained theoretical tool life equation for machining of steel and other alloys with carbides shows the satisfactory conformation with practical data.

These hypotheses were tested using data gathered from 29 chemicals/materials firms as part of a global assessment of strategic management of technology. Multifaceted measures of R&D impact were evaluated: (i) an index of R&D performance, (ii) time from concept to realization of product and process innovation, and (iii) satisfaction of three different stakeholders of the firm's R&D undertakings. Important differences were indicated among the strategies that most affect each performance measure, although the use of multifunctional teams and the corporate-level development and acceptance of technology strategy mechanisms were significant factors across the board. The results support the framework in that key contributors to R&D outcomes were found in managerial approaches that relate to each of the three elements.}

The experts or decision maker's opinions are in linguistics forms. The proposed approach is the extension of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for multiple experts. The pairwise or relative comparisons of decision linguistic judgments are characterized by interval type 2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS). The integrated methodology consists of the following stages: 1. Construct IT2FS pairwise comparison matrix (PCM), 2. Elicit IT2FS weights and rates, 3. Normalize the IT2FS weights and rates, 4. Synthesize the IT2FS weights and rates, 5. Calculate the global IT2FS rates, 6. Determine the final decision priority. At the outset of the decision making the IT2FS PCM for a set of criteria is created. The quadratic programming models are constructed to elicit the absolute IT2FS weights of the criteria in the sense of minimizing the least squares logarithmic regression functions. A normalization procedure is introduced for the IT2FS vector to obtain the well-defined and normalized IT2FS weights. Two approaches, the linear programming model and the IT2 fuzzy weighted average (FWA), are developed to synthesize and aggregate the local rates and weights. Thus, the overall global IT2FS rates for the alternatives are obtained. The final decision then can be concluded by the priority of the overall IT2FS rates of the alternatives. The proposed approach is applied to New Product Development (NPD) project screening. NPD is largely uncertain, because of competition accompanied with modern technology and market changes. It always leads to failure of New Product Development. The final project screening decision is obtained from the overall global IT2FS rates of the projects with respect to the screening criteria.}

We initially examined the statistics of papers by unveiling influential journals, affiliations and articles. Second, we utilized co-citation network analysis, an objective procedure to extract clusters of what has been researched in supplier selection literature. The study analytically retrieves six major knowledge clusters: 1) conceptual foundation of the field; 2) modeling of the procurement environment; 3) handling group-decision making and unprecise input data; 4) computational research; 5) green/sustainable research and 6) risk-based supplier selection. Finally, we conducted main path analysis to get an overview of the evolution of knowledge in the supplier selection field by uncovering its major paths and key articles.}

abstract = {Traditionally, the linguistic variable based decision making mainly employs linguistic cardinalities with uniformly distributed scales. Within such scaling systems, the verbal information could be illustrated by multiple forms, such as the extended linguistic scale values and the 2-tuple linguistic representation. In general, the fundamental procedure to implement such methods involves the translation of the experts’ verbal judgements into computable linguistic variables, the arithmetic operations of the linguistic variables, and the transformation of the derived outcomes back to the verbal terms. Meanwhile, still many experts prefer presenting their linguistic assessments on an unevenly distributed cardinality in contrast with the evenly distributed sets. In light of the mission “computing with words”, it is essential to design a unified way to model the linguistic scale sets with both evenly and unevenly distributed cardinalities. Since the normal distribution serves as a decent tool to model the subjective judgements, in the present paper, a series of normal distribution based unbalanced linguistic scale sets are constructed. Besides, the area blocks under the distribution curve are applied to bridge the unbalanced linguistic variables and their relative coordinates. Furthermore, a novel 3-tuple format of unbalanced linguistic variable representation is proposed. The 3-tuple model is a generalized form of the linguistic information, and it could further degenerate to its 2-tuple linguistic counterpart. Finally, two numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the proposed unbalanced linguistic variable based models and the 3-tuple linguistic information representation approach.}

The objective of the paper is to assess the cumulative impact of these two contradictory effects. Changes in funding patterns over time are also examined. Data on all E-Rate projects where the recipient is a school district were collected for two years, 1999 and 2004, for the state of Pennsylvania. Results show that E-Rate funding was significantly positively correlated with the poverty rate and percentage of minority students fulfilling the policy intent, but school districts receiving more revenue per student also obtained higher E-Rate support. Location too was found to be a significant predictor of E-Rate funding. The policy implications of these findings are discussed in the conclusion.}

Moreover, in this study, another mathematical programming model is constructed to improve the consistency level of unacceptably multiplicative consistent IFPRs. For group decision-making (GDM) with incomplete IFPRs, three reliable sources influencing the weights of experts are identified. Subsequently, a method for determining the weights of experts is developed by simultaneously considering three reliable sources. Furthermore, a targeted consensus process (CPR) is developed in this study with reference to the actual situation of the consensus level of each IFPR. Meanwhile, in response to the proposed multiplicative consistency definition, a novel method for determining the optimal priority weights of alternatives is redefined.

Recently, the possibility to produce exotic nuclear beams with energies far above the Coulomb barrier by projectile fragmentation opened a new field of secondary beam physics, the direct use of isotopically separated beams of unstable nuclei for nuclear reactions.

Subjects from 34 in-depth focus groups in central Indiana were fairly knowledgeable about biofuels technologies, but uninformed about biofuels policies despite being from a state where biofuels are a salient political issue. A narrow majority was supportive of biofuels in general, but expressed greater enthusiasm about “second generation” biofuels. Subject beliefs about biofuels’ economic and environmental impacts were most important in shaping these opinions, rather than concerns about energy independence or other issues. In terms of policy options, subjects were most supportive of an alternative fuels standard and least supportive of a fixed subsidy and a cap and trade policy. In contrast to arguments about technologies, participants primarily framed their attitudes toward policies in terms of fairness. Although discussion did not substantially change aggregate preferences for most policies, it did increase support significantly for at least one policy proposal—a variable subsidy for ethanol. It is particularly noteworthy that subjects generally did not support the most common biofuel technology—corn-based ethanol—or the most prominent biofuels policy option—the fixed subsidy—despite residing in a state hosting a strong corn industry and staunch political advocates for both positions.}

abstract = {There are several tools in the literature that support innovation in organizations. Some of the most cited are the so-called technology roadmapping methods, also known as TRM. However, these methods are designed primarily for organizations that adopt the market pull strategy of technology–product integration. Organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy are neglected in the literature. Furthermore, with the advent of open innovation, it is possible to note the need to consider the adoption of partnerships in the innovation process. Thus, this study proposes a method of technology roadmapping, identified as method for technology push (MTP), applicable to organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy, such as SMEs and independent research centers in an open-innovation environment. The method was developed through action-research and was assessed from two analytical standpoints: externally, via a specific literature review on its theoretical contributions, and internally, through the analysis of potential users' perceptions on the feasibility of applying MTP. The results indicate both the unique character of the method and its perceived implementation feasibility. Future research is suggested in order to validate the method in different types of organizations}

abstract = {The current complexity of supply chains (SC) activities requires the need for coordination between supply chains partners to maximize the efficiency. Considered by practitioners as one of the main SC coordination problems, this paper considers the strategic supplier selection problem. Fuzzy set is used in order to address the imprecision of supply chain partners in formulating the preferences values of various selection criteria. The problem is formulated as a multi-stakeholder multi-criteria (MSMC) decision making problem and solved using two novel approaches. The first hybrid approach combines the fuzzy consensus-based possibility measure and fuzzy TOPSIS method. The second hybrid approach combines the fuzzy consensus-based neat OWA and goal programming model where, the inclusion and participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process is explicit. For each approach, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation (CCSD) based objective weight determination model is used to compute the criteria weights. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approaches, a simple example of strategic supplier selection problem is presented and the numerical results analyzed. Moreover, for each approach, the deviations between individual solutions and collective solution are evaluated using the Levenshtein distance. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are listed.}

The features observed on these groups of firms allow the determination of the firms’ innovation capacity and are useful for providing recommendations and practical actions for them, with a view to reinforcing it.

abstract = {Background: The identification of potent small molecule ligands to receptors and enzymes is one of the major goals of chemical and biological research. Two powerful new tools that can be used in these efforts are combinatorial chemistry and structure-based design. Here we address how to join these methods in a design protocol that produces libraries of compounds that are directed against specific macromolecular targets. The aspartyl class of proteases, which is involved in numerous biological processes, was chosen to demonstrate this effective procedure. Results: Using cathepsin D, a prototypical aspartyl protease, a number of low nanomolar inhibitors were rapidly identified. Although cathepsin D is implicated in a number of therapeutically relevant processes, potent nonpeptide inhibitors have not been reported previously. The libraries, synthesized on solid support, displayed nonpeptide functionality about the (hydroxyethyl)amine isostere. The (hydroxyethyl)amine isostere, which targets the aspartyl protease class, is a stable mimetic of the tetrahedral intermediate of amide hydrolysis. Structure-based design, using the crystal structure of cathepsin D complexed with the peptide-based natural product pepstatin, was used to select the building blocks for the library synthesis. The library yielded a ‘hit rate’ of 6–7% at 1 μM inhibitor concentrations, with the most potent compound having a Ki value of 73 nM. More potent, nonpeptide inhibitors (Ki = 9–15 nM) of cathepsin D were rapidly identified by synthesizing and screening a small second generation library. Conclusions: The success of these studies clearly demonstrates the power of coupling the complementary methods of combinatorial chemistry and structure-based design. We anticipate that the general approaches described here will be successful for other members of the aspartyl protease class and for many other enzyme classes.}

We develop a theoretical framework integrating four distinct channels through which neighbors’ income can affect utility: public goods, cost of living, expectations of future income, and direct effects (RIH or altruism). We estimate the relationship with SWB data from the U.S. Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index and median-income data from the American Community Survey for ZIP codes and MSAs. The relationship is proximity-dependent: positive (negative) when using ZIP-code (MSA) median income as reference income, suggesting that positive (negative) channels dominate locally (regionally) and reconciling the literature’s seemingly divergent results. These findings are consistent across SWB measures and many health-related indices. Additional analyses support the public-goods and cost­of-living channels.}

Given that the priority of R&D projects and the interdependencies between the projects in a high tech firm change dynamically, high tech R&D project management is a complex and challenging endeavor. To improve the understanding and management of high tech R&D projects, this paper reports the findings of a field study where we, first, develop and empirically estimate a model that relates project priority over time with the generative mechanisms of market pull and technical challenge associated with R&D projects. Next, we develop and demonstrate the application of a process model within which the time-varying project priority model is embedded. The process model makes it possible to allocate fixed resources among competing projects with time-varying interdependencies, thereby improving the timeliness of project completion. This research was conducted in collaboration with a major U.S. high tech firm. The corporate R&D center of the firm served as the research setting for the field study. We present an application of the process model to delineate the evolution of the R&D organization with the merger of its (technology driven) parent firm with another (market driven) high tech manufacturing firm. The application of the process model generates theoretical insights that are used to develop testable propositions. Implications of the study findings and directions for future research are discussed.}

A successful innovation is often associated with adoption and execution of all SECI (socialization-externalization-combination-internalization) modes of knowledge creation within any Product Development (PD) phase. This article is an attempt to argue with the general notion and to distinguish different PD phases’ affinity corresponding to distinct SECI modes. In this regard, the paper proposes an extended Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (EFAHP) approach to determine the ranking in which any PD phase is influenced from SECI modes. In the EFAHP approach, the complex problem of knowledge creation is first itemized into a simple hierarchical structure for pairwise comparisons. Next, a triangular fuzzy number (TFN) concept is applied to capture the inherent vagueness in linguistic terms of a decision-maker. This paper recommends mapping TFNs with normal distributions about X-axis. This allows us to develop a mathematical formulation to estimate the degree of possibility (importance value) when two TFNs do not intersect with each other (current techniques in literature calculate this value as zero). In order to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed EFAHP in ranking SECI modes, an empirical study of development phase is considered. Five criteria and their 19 sub-criteria for measuring the phase’s performance are identified based on both an extensive discussion with subject matter experts and rigorous literature survey. After stringent analysis, we found that the mode that highly influenced the development phase is ‘combination mode’. The article discusses the application of lean tools that can be employed to improve the knowledge creation process.}

The proposed structure uses CRiteria Importance Through Inter -criteriaCorrelation (CRITIC) and combined compromised solution (CoCoSo) under IVFN environment for evaluation and selection of suppliers for a dairy company in Iran. Alternative supplier 5 (S5) emerges as the best supplier with the highest overall score (1.168). Average Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the proposed model and other well established decision-making models methods is found as 0.9651 which establishes reliability of model outcomes. The estimated zero value of Gini Index indicates that supplier 5 has a constant ranking in all considered methods. This is a practical sustainable supplier selection platform which allows decision makers in procurement and SC industries to select the most suitable supplier in any pre-determined period.}

The traditional large-scale manufacturing mode cannot meet the individual needs of customers. The production mode of the enterprises has been changed from the traditional inventory mode to the customization manufacturing mode driven by the customer orders. Furthermore, the simple customization model cannot meet the industrial needs in the open and networked era. Therefore, there is a lack of an innovative manufacturing mode that not only meets the individual needs of customers, but also adapts to today’s open and networked environment. In this paper, a new customization model was proposed, which is a continuously improved customization model called CPMS (Customer Platform-connection Manufactory to Service). By means of research methodology of literature review and analysis, the birth, concept, and evolution of CPMS in PSS are discussed. Through analysing the development of industry, combining with the existing analysis and projects we involved in, and the method of system engineering analysis, an overall framework of CPMS model is derived. At last, a case study for implementation of CPMS in the car industry has been given. Under this model, enterprises can improve the flexible production capacity of production line, reduce the production cost, reduce inventory, improve the modular configuration of products, and etc. Moreover, it can provide some reference value for enterprises to plan, design, implement and apply a new customization production model that conform to the requirements of the new era of open and networked.}

abstract = {A study of the effect of viscoelastic material damping on the dynamic response of multibody systems, consisting of interconnected rigid, elastic and viscoelastic components, is presented. The motion of each elastic or viscoelastic body is identified by using three sets of modes: rigid body, reference and normal modes. Rigid body modes describe translation and large angular rotation of a body reference. Reference modes are the result of imposing the body-axis conditions. Normal modes define the deformation of the body relative to the body reference. Constraints between different components are formulated by using a set of non-linear algebraic equations that can be introduced to the dynamic formulation by using a Lagrange multiplier technique or can be utilized to eliminate dependent co-ordinates by partitioning the constraint Jacobian matrix. In developing the system equations of motion of the viscoelastic component, an assumption of a linear viscoelastic model is made. A Kelvin-Voigt model is employed, wherein the stress is assumed to be proportional to the strain and its time derivative. The formulation yields a constant damping matrix and the damping forces depend only on the local deformation; thus, no additional coupling between the reference and elastic co-ordinates appears in the formulation when considering the viscoelastic effects. It is demonstrated, by a numerical example, that the viscoelastic material damping can have a significant effect on the dynamic response of multibody systems.}

In addition, determining an acceptable solution with respect to different factors is certainly a very demanding and difficult task. In this paper, a new Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method for a sustainable supplier selection in the healthcare industry (in a polyclinic) in Bosnia and Herzegovina is developed. The advantages of the developed method are: the consideration of an anti-ideal and ideal solution at the very beginning of the formation of an initial matrix, closer determination of utility degree in relation to both solutions, the proposal of a new way to determine utility functions and their aggregation, the possibility to consider a large set of criteria and alternatives while maintaining the stability of the method. Supplier selection is very important for organizations in the medical industry. Sustainability in the supplier selection process in the medical industry is a strategically important issue, and poorly implemented in the private medical sector. Therefore, the example explains how to use the MARCOS method to select sustainable suppliers in the private medical sector. A case study of a sustainable supplier selection for the healthcare industry (a polyclinic) includes ranking of eight alternatives with regard to 21 criteria for all aspects of sustainability. The results and verification of the new method are carried out throughout a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. 21 scenarios with changes in the weight values of criteria were established, the measurement scale from 1 to 9 was changed to 1–5, a comparison with six other MCDM methods was performed, and it was verified in dynamic conditions which implied a change of the elements of the initial decision-making matrix. All phases of the sensitivity analysis showed the validity of MARCOS method. The obtained results and all scenarios in sensitivity analysis show that A2 remains the best alternative.}

abstract = {This paper reviews some of the recent developments in the design and application of performance measurement systems. External measurement of a company's performance, as seen by its customers, is perhaps the most crucial. Performance in terms of features, cost quality and delivery, needs to be understood and tracked. A knowledge of competitors' performance along these same dimensions is also vital. The manufacturing business achieves its external performance through an appropriate set of internal activities. Excellent performance in certain key activities will be essential in achieving external goals, while others can perform more modestly. Internal activities which are vital to many manufacturing busineses include quality, production, people and new product introduction. The business manager needs to ensure that his internal and external measurement systems are coherent and that the financial constraints and targets are observed. The third part of the review introduces four approaches, which in different ways, seek to integrate performance measures. Finally, some preliminary field observations of performance measurement systems are presented and the paper concludes with a brief discussion of a research agenda for the subject.}

Five periods of chick development were observed: post fertilization days 14 (stage 40), 16 (stage 42), 17 (stage 43), 21 (stage H0), 23 (stage H2). The shapes of the stress-strain curves, ultimate tensile strength, and strain to failure were used to follow changes in the biomechanical properties during development. The ultimate tensile strength increased from 2.05 MPa (1 MPa= 106N/m2) at stage 40 to 58.05 at 2 days post hatching. A statistically significant increase in measured tensile strength was observed between stage 42 and stage 43. Strain to failure was 13% at stage 40, 22% at stage 42, and 29% for stages 43, H0, and H2. Changes in total tendon collagen were assessed by measuring hydroxyproline content. Hydroxyproline/g of dry weight increased at each successive stage of morphogenesis and ranged from 39.17 mg/g dry weight at stage 40 to 83.41 mg/g dry weight at stage H2. Dry weight increased from 12.91% to 20.19% over the same period. The mean collagen fibril diameter ranged from approximately 45 nm to 62 nm. The fibril distribution was unimodal at all stages, but changed from a tight unimodal (stage 40, 42) to a broad unimodal distribution by stage H2.}

These laminates were prepared in the laboratory using a wet deposition method and compared with samples prepared on a commercial melt impregnation GMT line. We found that laminate tensile strength increased linearly with fibre concentration up to 60% w/w. Laminate strength was also found to increase with increasing fibre length. At high values of fibre length (> 3–6 mm) the strength reached a plateau level which was directly dependent on fibre content. The matrix molecular weight appeared to have little direct influence on the level of laminate strength. However, the glass fibre sizing compatibility was found to have a strong effect on the tensile strength of both laboratory made wet deposited laminates and commercially prepared GMTs. The tensile strength of the GMT samples also showed a clear correlation with the measured fibre strength. A modified version of the Kelly-Tyson model gave calculated values of laminate strength which correlated well with the experimental data. We propose that the tensile strength of these laminates is governed by the properties of the fibres which have an orientation close to parallel with the loading direction.}

A number of important concepts including those of path dependency, technological trajectories, together with the plethora of articles concerned with organizational learning, involving the contribution and limitations of tacit knowledge, have helped us to understand the nature of innovation. As important as these strands of literature are, we suggest that a key weakness in much of the literature on innovation is that it does not deal sufficiently with the contextual issues concerning the changing paradigms of manufacturing and the profound impact that these developments have had upon the innovation process. We offer the concept of strategic resonance as a missing ingredient within some firms who are now faced with conditions of hyper competition where ongoing innovation is a key requirement. The concept of strategic resonance is not offered as a prescriptive panacea but it is suggested that firms need to understand and remove the blockages to strategic resonance as part of their innovation development processes.}

abstract = {To improve the service quality of the railway system (e.g., punctuality and travel times) and to enhance the robust timetabling methods further, this paper proposes an integrated two-stage approach to consider the recovery-to-optimality robustness into the optimized timetable design without predefined structure information (defined as flexible structure) such as initial departure times, overtaking stations, train order and buffer time. The first-stage timetabling model performs an iterative adjustment of all departure and arrival times to generate an optimal timetable with balanced efficiency and recovery-to-optimality robustness. The second-stage dispatching model evaluates the recovery-to-optimality robustness by simulating how each timetable generated from the first-stage could recover under a set of restricted scenarios of disturbances using the proposed dispatching algorithm. The concept of recovery-to-optimality is examined carefully for each timetable by selecting a set of optimally refined dispatching schedules with minimum recovery cost under each scenario of disturbance. The robustness evaluation process enables an updating of the timetable by using the generated dispatching schedules. Case studies were conducted in a railway corridor as a special case of a simple railway network to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively attain a good trade-off between the timetable efficiency and obtainable robustness for practical applications.}

Commonly referred to as Smart Product-Service Systems (Smart PSS), these systems promise to create value at a personal level by collecting and effectively utilizing the operational data. However, one of the fundamental challenges is the lack of awareness as to what kind of data can be collected from the operational stage and what can be achieved from this data. This paper systematically reviews scientific literature to underline the kind of data being collected from the operational stage, the purposes being achieved from that data, and how they lead to value creation. The systematic review of 60 representative studies enabled the definition of the operational scenario that comprises 4 dimensions of data and 10 classes of data within these dimensions to generically identify what kind of data is being collected. The intend presented by various authors led to the generalization of 5 themes that target different purposes of collecting data. Further, the papers were classified with regards to functional or non-functional requirements to see how data in different approaches are leveraged for value creation. Finally, the discussion highlights the current gaps in the literature and raises several opportunities for future contributions.}

This paper proposes a method that uses correlation analysis and structural equation modelling for identifying the influence that AMTs have on the manufacturing competitiveness of Maquiladoras in Central America. An empirical test using this method in Maquiladoras in the apparel industry in Honduras shows a positive effect between AMTs use and manufacturing competitiveness, especially in the delivery time and environmental protection factors.}

However, with the rapid technological developments in recent years and the guests who have adapted to these developments, the companies operating in this field have started to feel the need to respond to changing behaviors and demands. The effects of digital transformation have begun to appear in the hospitality industry. However, the service quality phenomenon that determines the performances of the firms and provides them competitiveness and profitability has continued to exist. Companies need to focus on service quality from another perspective. In this study, strategic service quality analysis was performed with the digital transformation perspective in the hospitality industry. The SERVQUAL model, a classic service quality model, has been rearranged with a digital transformation perspective and a new service quality model is proposed for the digital hospitality industry. Criteria weights are obtained by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Evaluation processes of decision makers and calculations are carried out in intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment to eliminate uncertainties and vagueness. Priority weights are used to rank the criteria.}

abstract = {The progress in high technology has led to the wide use of thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD). The evolution of the manufacturing technology of TFT-LCD keeps increasing the size of TFT-LCD since a larger TFT-LCD allows a larger display application and an improved productivity. However, as the size of TFT-LCD increases, the size of TFT-array substrates and color filter substrates has to increase simultaneously. This leads to a more complicated inventory problem of large-sized substrates. Therefore, this paper considers a color filter replenishment problem in TFT-LCD manufacturing with the consideration of storage space, yield rate, quantity discounts and multiple suppliers. We first formulate the color filter replenishment problem as a fuzzy multiple objective programming, and then a fuzzy multiple objective programming with assigned weights for objectives based on experts’ opinions is proposed. An example with four cases is given to illustrate the practicality for empirical investigation. The results demonstrate that both methods are effective tools for inventory management of color filters for multi-periods. In addition, the methods can be applied or modified for managing inventory in general.}

A model of service performance effects on customer satisfaction and loyalty is introduced and tested in the fast food service industry using customer perceptions of provider performance rather than relying on providers' self-reported performance indicators. The research revealed that the benefit of establishing customer relationships emerges from the enhanced insight the supplier is able to gain regarding customer needs and wants. Upon learning of these needs and wants, the service provider can focus on operational means of meeting the needs and wants, and doing so in the lowest cost manner.}

Our model incorporates (i) the factors of technological ability of a firm to design the preannounced product, and (ii) the impact of the preannouncement on the product acceptance behavior of channel members and the choice behavior of prospective customers. Such behavior is governed by credibility of the firm's preannouncement and expectations about the availability of the new product; a channel member's decision to accept the new product depends upon the expected sales and the product's acceptance by other channel members. These issues lead logically to the interdependence between product positioning and preannouncement decisions of the firm. Our model also examines the trade-off between development time of a technologically superior product and preannouncement of a marginally better product. We conclude with a discussion of the data required to implement the forecasting model as well as implications for the product development process, competitive behavior, and future research.}
