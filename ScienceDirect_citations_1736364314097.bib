abstract = {This study investigates the effect of the nationality of investors on the location of manufacturing investment in the US. Based on the preceding literature, the central notion that the national origin of these firms has had an effect on the importance of location-specific factors is examined. In contrast to past studies, however, the paper utilizes conjoint analysis and addresses methodological issues not fully considered in previous research. Through a survey of German, Japanese and American manufacturers, the results show that significant differences across nationality groups do exist, indicating the dynamic influence of nationality on the location behavior of foreign investment.}

abstract = {Coal consumption and energy production (CCEP) has received increasing attention since coal-fired power plants play a dominant role in the power sector worldwide. In China, coal is expected to retain its primary energy position over the next few decades. However, a large share of CO2 emissions and other environmental hazards, such as SO2 and NOx, are attributed to coal consumption. Therefore, understanding the environmental implications of the life cycle of coal from its production in coal mines to its consumption at coal-fired power plants is an essential task. Evaluation of such environmental burdens can be conducted using the life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. The main issues with the traditional LCA results are the lack of a numerical magnitude associated with the performance level of the obtained environmental burden values and the inherent uncertainty associated with the output results. This issue was addressed in this research by integrating the traditional LCA methodology with a weighted fuzzy inference system model, which is applied to a Chinese coal-to-energy supply chain system to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness. Regarding the coal-to-energy supply chain under investigation, the CCEP environmental performance has been determined as “medium performance”, with an indicator score of 39.15%. Accordingly, the decision makers suggested additional scenarios (redesign, equipment replacement, etc.) to improve the performance. A scenario-based analysis was designed to identify alternative paths to mitigate the environmental impact of the coal-to-energy supply chain. Finally, limitations and possible future work are discussed, and the conclusions are presented.}

abstract = {Linguistic distribution assessment (LDA) plays a prominent role in describing the subjective uncertainties and objective distribution of decision-maker (DM) opinions. Although there have been several studies on LDA, few of these studies have paid attention to the different understandings of language semantics provided by DMs. To address the issue, type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets (T2FSs) are a well-known approach because T2FSs can accurately model the understanding of individuals with linguistic uncertainty. A trapezium (or trapezoidal) interval type-2 fuzzy set (TrIT2FS) is a common application of T2 fuzzy logic. Accordingly, this paper discusses a novel LDA called a canonical triangular interval type-2 fuzzy set (CTriIT2FS)-LDA in a T2 fuzzy environment. The CTriIT2FS-LDA combines a CTriIT2FS simplified from a TrIT2FS with LDA, which can simplify the computation while retaining their advantages. To facilitate the calculation of the CTriIT2FS-LDA, the basic operations of the CTriIT2FSs and the CTriIT2F-LDA, such as the defuzzied (crisp) function, distance measurement, and entropy measurement, are defined. Based on the TODIM approach, a CTriIT2F-LDA-TODIM is developed for FMEA for interval type-2 fuzzy environments. Furthermore, the proposed approach is applied in a practical case for FMEA for the electric vehicle DC charging piles of the State Grid Corporation of China.}

The main objective of this work is to reduce the imprecise content of customer evaluation process and thus, improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the product design. This paper proposes a novel way of performing design concept evaluations where instead of considering cost and benefit characteristics of design criteria, the work identifies best concept which satisfy constraints imposed by the team of designers on design criteria’s as well as fulfilling maximum customers’ preferences. In this work, the rough number enabled modified Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method for design concept evaluation is developed by modifying the extended VIKOR method with interval numbers. The proposed technique is labeled as modified rough VIKOR (MR-VIKOR) analysis. The work primarily involves two phases of concept evaluation. In the first phase, relative importance ranking and initial weights of design criteria are computed through the importance assigned to each design criteria by the designers or the decision makers (DM); and in the second phase, customers’ preferences to the generated user needs are captured in the form of rough numbers. The relative importance ranking computed in first phase along with customers’ preferences is incorporated in the second phase to select the best concept.}

In this paper, spatial dependency is incorporated in a hedonic model based on housing, neighborhood, demographic, and school quality attributes readily available on the Internet for home sales in Howard County, Maryland. The importance of using readily available measures is that perceptions in the public are formed by them. The study also addresses potential omitted variable bias by incorporating school assessment measures over the K-12 grade range. The consideration of spatial dependency in hedonic models is imperative since the findings are sensitive to appropriately modeling the spatial component of home prices. The results indicate that there is consistent and significant evidence of the capitalization of 8th grade test scores and SAT scores in home prices, and inconsistent evidence of the capitalization of 3rd grade test scores. The elasticities of house price with respect to test scores are all in the inelastic range and smaller than those found in other studies. This study provides clear guidance on how to test for spatial heterogeneity and non-normality of error terms before proceeding with hedonic analysis.}

A critical challenge for integrating personalized modules into a product architecture is determining the optimal assembly architecture when considering market expectations and manufacturing constraints. In this paper, an optimization method is proposed for determining the personalized product design architecture that incorporates individual customer preferences. First, a decision hierarchy is presented to describe the integrated design decisions of the product architecture, including product variety determination, module variant selection, and personalized module configuration. Next, a profit model is formulated as an overall performance metric that incorporates customer preferences and manufacturing cost. The systematic patterns and randomness of diverse customer preferences are modeled by combining conjoint analysis and market segmentation with a multivariate normal mixture model. Individual customer product utilities in the target market and their product purchase intent probability are estimated through Monte-Carlo simulation, which is incorporated into the profit calculation. Manufacturing limitations on processes and materials are included as they influence manufacturer’s planning on candidate module variants and production strategies of personalized modules. These models are used to determine a product family architecture that maximizes profit by optimally determining its offering of product variants, module combinations, and personalized module configuration through a genetic algorithm. The proposed method is demonstrated by a personalized bicycle architecture design example.}

Due to its impact on organization’s competitive power, researchers have proposed models to measure social performance in supply chains. However, most of these researches reveal shortcomings once encountering the cases with a huge number of criteria due to their complex computations. In order to fill this gap, this study proposes a new soft computing multi-criteria interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy distance to ideal solution approach based on interval-valued Pythagorean closeness which performs outstandingly in cases with a high fluctuation in the number of criteria. A new mechanism is defined to distinguish the weak performing social factors through supply chains by classifying them into four categorize based on their performance and distance to the best performing factors. This approach is unique in the sense that it both covers a remarkable amount of uncertainty and eases the computational processes of the previous multi-criteria decision making approaches by modifying the steps to select the most ideal solution. The feasibility and applicability of this approach have been validated by applications to a numerical case and comparative analysis.}

Thus, maintaining the business operations in a cost-effective manner is of paramount importance in this destructive business environment. While realizing this goal, a special focus on Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) operations is indispensable, considering that a significant proportion of expenses in the industry are originated from them. Since the MRO departments are responsible for maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aircrafts and engines under very strict standards, a smooth, clean-cut supply chain does not only provide a solid technical ground for daily operations but also it helps to gain a comparative advantage in cost leadership which, in turn, results with high customer satisfaction. Obviously, a key component of this chain is designing a robust and reliable Supplier Performance Evaluation (SPE) methodology where numerous tangible and intangible evaluation criteria come into play reflecting the multifaceted characteristic of the decision problem. This work proposes a three-phase hybrid approach to address the SPE problem in aviation industry where the suppliers are obliged to follow tight tolerances regarding quality and delivery times. Starting with selection of the most significant evaluation criteria, in the second stage, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy (IT2F)-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to determine their relative importance. These weights are then given as input to an IT2F-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. We used the IT2F extensions due to the fact that some of the evaluation criteria are subjective and qualitative in nature. To prove the merit of the proposed methodology, an application is presented to SPE problem at Turkish Technic Inc., a subsidiary of Turkish Airlines.}

In this article, a prototype crowdsourcing system is proposed to tackle these problems. Through the establishment of a task development model which consists of i) an innovation target analysis module, ii) an innovation-oriented HIT (human intelligent task) allocation module, and iii) a cheating control module, the proposed system is able to analyze and decompose the innovation target. In addition, it can identify suitable tasks to facilitate innovation and to embed anti-cheating measures in task design. To demonstrate the proposed prototype system, a case study on a future PC design is presented. Through control testing, it appears that the proposed system is effective in generating more valid and innovative ideas.}

In this research, a general closed loop supply chain network is examined that includes manufacturer, disassembly, refurbishing, and disposal sites. Meanwhile, it is managed by the manufacturer. We propose an integrated model which has two phases. In the first phase, a framework for supplier selection criteria in RL is proposed. Besides, a fuzzy method is designed to evaluate suppliers based on qualitative criteria. The output of this stage is the weight of each supplier according to each part. In the second phase, we propose a multi objective mixed-integer linear programming model to determine which suppliers and refurbishing sites should be selected (strategic decisions), and find out the optimal number of parts and products in CLSC network (tactical decisions). The objective functions maximize profit and weights of suppliers, and one of them minimizes defect rates. To our knowledge, this model is the first effort to consider supplier selection, order allocation, and CLSC network configuration, simultaneously. The mathematical programming model is validated through numerical analysis.}

Adoption is highest among assembling firms and is related to a competitive and unpredictable environment. Cost reduction is the main objective and benefit of these practices. The product development and design departments are leading in the target cost management process, which is mainly performed in team structures.}

The aim of this paper is to propose an originally structured multi-methodological approach based on the systematic application of the SWOT analysis, the AHP and the TOPSIS methods to support the critical decision process on shipping registry selection under multiple criteria. In the proposed approach, the SWOT analysis is utilized to determine the key assessment factors on the shipping registry decision and to structure the decision hierarchy. While the AHP is used to measure the relative importance of evaluation criteria in this decision hierarchy, the TOPSIS is applied to rank the shipping registry alternatives. As a case study, major open registries are analyzed to select the most suitable of them for the fleet that is operated by a worldwide ship owner. The results show that the proposed multi-methodological approach takes the advantages of the SWOT analysis, the AHP and the TOPSIS to select the most suitable shipping registry. The proposed approach also provides a relatively simple and very well suited decision-making tool for this type of strategic decision making problem.}

abstract = {Part consolidation (PC) is one of the effective ways to simplify product structure. Through part consolidation, it is expected to reduce weight and size, minimize assembly operation, improve performance, and prolong service life. As additive manufacturing (AM) evolves into an end-of-use product manufacturing process, the possibility of part consolidation has further increased. However, the life-cycle sustainability aspect related to PC with AM is rarely known. To support design for environment, this paper proposes a framework to systematically investigate the environmental impact of PC on production, service, and end-of-life (EoL) activities. In this framework, generic quantitative models for PC-related sustainability assessment of these life-cycle stages are presented from an incremental perspective. In each model, change in sustainability indices are calculated with respect to the change propagated from the design change (PC) when PC is achieved. From the model, consolidated design shows definite promise at assembly and service stage; however, there is still uncertainty in deciding the sustainability benefit at manufacturing and EoL stage. In this paper, a case study with a redesigned floor attachment in a train is exemplified and binder jetting (BJ) AM process is chosen as the default manufacturing process. Due to the lack of data of EoL and minor effect on maintenance as well as fuel economy, only the environmental impact on production is analyzed. The result reveals two important implications: 1) consolidated design shows significant promise in reducing energy consumption and environmental impact (average 20%), but it results in an increase of health toxicity level; 2) reduction of environmental impact (up limit 13.2%) at assembly stage is not obvious. In the end, important conclusions and future research are outlined.}

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical factor in estimating groundwater recharge in the area and a substantial component of the groundwater budget. In this study, two estimates of soil-moisture ET and two estimates of groundwater ET in the Verde Valley are presented and discussed. Basin-scale soil-moisture potential ET (PET) estimates from the soil-water balance (SWB) and basin characteristics model (BCM) groundwater recharge models are compared. Separately, riparian groundwater ET estimated from a method that uses MODIS-EVI remote sensing data and geospatial information, and from the MODFLOW-EVT ET package as part of a regional groundwater-flow model that includes the study area, are also discussed. Somewhat higher PET rates from the SWB recharge model resulted in an average annual ET volume about 17% greater than for PET from the BCM recharge model. For groundwater ET estimates, annual ET volumes were about the same for upper-bound MODIS-EVI ET for perennial reaches of streams as for the MODFLOW ET estimates, with the small differences between the two methods having minimal impact on annual or longer groundwater budgets for the study area.}

Their concept encourages a business that is resting on its present accomplishments to seek greater gain. However, their behavioral model is not easy to operate for managers. In order to operate CI activity effectively and obtain company-wide involvement for management, we need a system which can meet the current CI status and lead the firm toward the correct road as described by Bessant et al. This system has to be open in the way that it can fit into any organization so that it can easily embed the necessary regenerative input into its physical structure. This system has also to be super in the way that it can successfully lead the organization structure toward the evolutionary route. Thus, we propose an open super system which places a pyramid composed by problem, models and tools, and promotion, at its core. Using Bessant et al.'s five evolutionary levels as a time map, this system can analyze a firm's improvement ability from the presentation of cases and find the proper regenerative input from the failure status. A firm can inject this input into its structure to upgrade its level of capability. Applying this open super system on our previous studies, we derived five improvement levels and the different ability types in each level. From there, we discovered some failure status in each level. We also drew some important perspectives on the injection of regenerative input from failure status, including the promotion of the technique-excellence ability, the value problem, and efficiently solving problem. To help the readers to understand this system better, we give ‘AB two stage’ system as an example to show how to inject regenerative input into the physical structure to fulfill the expectations from different perspectives.}

To model the hybrid uncertainties, the design range and system range of an evaluation criterion are expressed as a fuzzy variable and a random variable respectively. Calculating the Information Contents for these criteria would involve integrals whose bounds are fuzzy variables. To calculate these integrals, an expected Information Content Model (eICM) is proposed based upon the credibility theory. To reflect the designer’s risk appetite accurately, the confidence levels are introduced and a credibility Information Content Model (cICM) based on the chance constrains programming model is constructed. Two algorithms based on fuzzy simulation methods and Genetic Algorithm are developed for these two models. Finally, a case study is illustrated to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Adopting electric vehicles (EVs) plays a pivotal role in the transition towards sustainable transportation. However, numerous challenges hinder widespread acceptance and implementation. This study addresses these obstacles by evaluating and prioritising strategies within an interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) environment, offering a comprehensive framework for fostering EV adoption. Five key strategies are assessed by formulating a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. An analysis is conducted on these strategies across various challenges, encompassing economic, social, environmental, infrastructural, and technical aspects. A combination of “method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC)” and “rank sum” methods determines the importance of challenges. The study proposes a new distance measure based on triangular divergence for IVSF sets and modifies the Viekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method. The modified VIKOR method evaluates the strategies. Moreover, the study acknowledges decision experts' confidence levels by proposing new confidence level-based aggregation operators for data aggregation. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive government policies, incentives, and charging infrastructure development. It emphasises that economic and technical challenges require the most attention for successful EV adoption. A comparative analysis with existing distance-based MAGDM methods indicates the applicability of the proposed method, accompanied by a sensitivity assessment to ensure the proposed approach's robustness. The results of Spearman's correlation coefficient validate the model's practicality. The findings of this research yield significant insights beneficial to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers alike. Implementing the identified strategies and overcoming the key challenges can significantly accelerate the shift towards a sustainable transportation system powered by EVs. This comprehensive approach provides valuable guidance to decision-makers, helping to create a cleaner and more resilient future. Additionally, the new MAGDM method can be applied to other decision-making problems.}

abstract = {One of the questions involved in the formulation of a new model for a physiological phenomenon, when the model represents a dynamical system, is that concerning its qualitative behavior. The determination of the stability of a particular dynamical system is usually made analytically, from a linearization of the system around an equilibrium point. This analytic proof may often be very complex or impossible, leading to the imposition of conditions on the relative magnitude of the structural model parameters or to other partial results. We discuss a general technique whereby a probabilistic judgment is made on the stability of a dynamical system, and we apply it to the study of a particular delay differential system modelling the relationship between insulin secretion and glucose uptake. This technique is applicable in case experimental material is available from which to estimate the dispersion of the model parameters. A stability criterion is obtained via the usual linearization around an equilibrium point, it is approximated as a Taylor series in the parameters truncated after the first term, and its variance is then computed from the dispersion of the parameters. While the conclusion is probabilistic in nature, it can be obtained for a wide class of models and from either sample or individual experimental subject's parameter estimates.}

The vagueness of the linguistic terms in the evaluation process required employment of fuzzy numbers and accordingly the fuzzy version of PROMETHEE method, which is a multi-criteria ranking technique, is applied to the selection problem. The information obtained from F-PROMETHEE results is then used as a constraint in formulating a zero–one goal programming model. We demonstrated how a combined F-PROMETHEE and ZOGP model can be used for a real world application problem as an aid for equipment selection.}

In existing research, the study of PSS (Product Service System) does not simultaneously consider three factors: the product manufacturing mode oriented towards mass personalization in the product manufacturing process, the open community collaborative supply oriented towards community resources in the product supply process, and the product service system oriented towards personalized orders in the product service process. Therefore, the research object of this paper is an innovative model of personalized product service system (PPSS) for open community collaborative supply (OCCS). Firstly, an innovative model of PPSS for OCCS is proposed through business model, platform model, and data model. Secondly, the Process framework of PPSS for OCCS is studied. Thirdly, in-depth research is conducted on selection, configuration, and optimization for OCCS, including selection oriented customer requirements, configuration oriented supplier network, and optimization oriented personalized product of PPSS for OCCS. Finally, a case study is conducted using the automotive industry as an example to analyze the proposed research. By leveraging networked online supply resources and fully leveraging the collaborative effects of community-based division of labour and openness, it can achieve innovation in supply models, improve supply efficiency, and save supply resource costs.}

In addition, created changes in the business environment have led to change in the attitude of risk management to a process-oriented and systematic view. Because managers cannot decide based on the output of risk management process to implement improvement projects and allocate resources to them. This study has been tried to exactly identify and prioritize potential failures of the production process by using an approach based on the multi-stage Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) method and Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) technique with the help of the cross-functional team. In this approach, failures are prioritized according to the amount of impact of each failure on other failures, as well as the amount of three factors as severity, occurrence, and detection (outputs of PFMEA). This approach considers process-oriented view in manufacturing system through internal-stage and external-stage relationships between production process failures and covers disadvantages of traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) score such as disregarding internal relationships between failures. Hence, prioritization of potential failures based on the score which includes RPN determinant factors and causal relationships between failures is performed using the multi-stage FCM and learning algorithm based on extended Delta rule. The results of the proposed approach’s implementation in an active company in the food industry show that prioritization of failures is closer to reality and presents more full prioritization in comparison with approaches such as traditional RPN. The real case study in the food industry has been used to show the ability of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {The TOPSIS method, commonly known as the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions, is one of the most popular approaches used in multi-attribute decision making (MADM). The fundamental procedure of the traditional TOPSIS method is rather straightforward, the ranking position of an alternative depends on its relative closeness to the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution, respectively. In order to encompass uncertain and ambiguous decision elements, an extension of the original TOPSIS method has been coined. With the help of fuzzy sets based TOPSIS, an overwhelming trend of fuzzy decision making applications has been witnessed. In the present work, however, it is found that the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is unable to distinguish all the different alternatives under linguistic environment. Moreover, the undistinguishable alternatives are countless in quantity, and they have formed specific patterns with respect to the parameters of TOPSIS methods. To dampen this ranking ambiguity, we designed a set of supplemental methods to construct a revised TOPSIS approach with linguistic evaluations. Correspondingly, the sufficiency of the revised TOPSIS method to guarantee total orders has been proven. Furthermore, a numerical example concerning the production line improvement of a manufacturing company is demonstrated to validate the feasibility and supremacy of the proposed method. Finally, a series of further discussions are performed to shed some lights on the impacts caused by the changes of the alternative quantity, the attribute quantity, and the type of linguistic term.}

Further, these equilibria are asymptotically stable if suitable damping is present in the system. These properties motivated the development of an energy-based controller design methodology which aims at modifying the potential energy of the closed loop and the addition of the required dissipation. To achieve the latter objective measurement of the generalized velocities is typically required. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: First, we show that damping injection in general Euler-lagrange systems is still possible without velocity measurement provided we can include a dynamic extension which satisfies a dissipation propagation condition. This condition allows us to determine a class of controllers that globally asymptotically stabilizes a well defined family of Euler-Lagrange systems. Second, we identify this class for elastic joints robots, and show that two recent schemes solving this problem are particular cases of this class. Our results aim at providing a unified framework to compare different stabilizing schemes via analysis of their energy dissipation properties.}

abstract = {The five forces model has been one of the most influential frameworks for strategic management. In contrast to its importance as a centerpiece of textbooks, however, it has attracted less attention from both academic researchers and practicing managers. This is due to its innate weakness, difficulty in operationalization. The vital requisites for operationalizing the five forces model are to deal with it as a complex system composed of interrelated forces and their sub-forces, and to prioritize them with consideration of their interdependency. The tenet of this study is the requisites can be achieved through the analytic network process (ANP). The ANP, which is a generalization of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), produces priorities of elements in a complex network model with consideration of interdependency among elements. The five forces model is transformed into a network model of the ANP. The ANP procedure is then carried out to obtain the priority weights of the forces. Combining the derived weights and ratings on the forces produces the state-of-industry-competition index (SICI) values that represent the overall competitive condition of a given industry. The working of the proposed approach is provided with the help of a case study example of the Web portal Industry of Korea. The proposed ANP approach is expected to expand the five forces model into a workable system of analysis by improving its analytical power.}

Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about users’ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won’t easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data.}

These methods are usually applied to assess possible solutions to a problem, resulting in a ranking of alternatives. However, when it comes to making decisions about qualitative measures —such as service quality—, the quantitative assessment is a bit difficult to interpret. Therefore, taking into account the maturity of the linguistic assessment models, this paper puts forth a new solution proposal. It is a decision-making model that uses linguistic labels —represented with the 2-tuple notation— and a variable expressive richness when providing output results. This solution allows expressing results in a manner closer to the human cognitive system. To achieve this goal, a mechanism has been implemented for measuring the distance among the aggregate ratings, providing the decision-maker with a fast and intuitive answer. The proposal is illustrated with an application example based on the TOPSIS model, using linguistic labels throughout the entire process.}

Rather than making their own decisions, respondents frequently delegated decisions, including where to go, what to do, and where to eat to others traveling with them (called “social surrogates”). A median of 25 percent of respondents delegated destination choice, and 50 percent delegated dining and activity decisions while traveling. Because individuals may not make all of their decisions, all customers may not be of equal importance to tourism marketers. Some have little to no role in choice (as they defer decisions), while others (social surrogates) may hold great influence over others (by making decisions). Thus, identifying actual decision makers, rather than just considering all tourists, may be necessary to understand tourist consumer behavior. It is proposed delegated decisions are theoretically distinct from individual or group decisions.}

Most studies indicate that general intelligence is positively associated with cortical thickness in areas of association cortex distributed throughout both brain hemispheres. In this study, we performed a cortical thickness mapping analysis on data from 182 healthy typically developing males and females ages 9 to 24years to identify correlates of general intelligence (g) scores. To determine if these correlates also mediate associations of specific cognitive abilities with cortical thickness, we regressed specific cognitive test scores on g scores and analyzed the residuals with respect to cortical thickness. The effect of age on the association between cortical thickness and intelligence was examined. We found a widely distributed pattern of positive associations between cortical thickness and g scores, as derived from the first unrotated principal factor of a factor analysis of Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) subtest scores. After WASI specific cognitive subtest scores were regressed on g factor scores, the residual score variances did not correlate significantly with cortical thickness in the full sample with age covaried. When participants were grouped at the age median, significant positive associations of cortical thickness were obtained in the older group for g-residualized scores on Block Design (a measure of visual-motor integrative processing) while significant negative associations of cortical thickness were observed in the younger group for g-residualized Vocabulary scores. These results regarding correlates of general intelligence are concordant with the existing literature, while the findings from younger versus older subgroups have implications for future research on brain structural correlates of specific cognitive abilities, as well as the cognitive domain specificity of behavioral performance correlates of normative gray matter thinning during adolescence.}

In this context, this paper (i) consolidate extant research and aggregate findings of different studies on environmentally sustainable product innovation through an interpretative framework of published literature on the topic, and (ii) map critical success factors that drive the success of product innovation developed in this new logic of production and consumption. To achieve these objectives, a systematic literature review on environmentally sustainable product innovation was conducted. Results show that there are four main critical success factors for environmentally sustainable product innovation: market, law and regulation knowledge; interfunctional collaboration; innovation-oriented learning; and R&D investments. The factors identified in this research and corresponding variables were subjected to a brief empirical test by professionals. The test allowed a preliminary approval of the developed framework and identification of the most important variables within each factor.

Our method elicits causal knowledge from multiple experts based on DEMATEL and transforms it to a BN structure. It then parameterizes the BN by using ranked nodes and evaluates its robustness and consistency by using sensitivity analysis. The proposed method provides a practical and generic way to build probabilistic decision support models by systematically exploiting expert knowledge. Suitable applications of this method include decision problems with multiple criteria, high uncertainty and limited data. We illustrate our method by applying it to a supplier selection case study in a large automobile manufacturer in Turkey.}

In “Specific retail solution generation” phase, the service TRIZ contradiction matrix is constructed, which leads to the resolution of innovative principles and then new service system can be carried out. Then, we evaluate the new service system in the “Evaluating customer experience” phase by using the experiential model.

The approach aims to integrate this performance evaluation of sustainable development, and use qualitative and quantitative information with the sustainability-balanced scorecard. The multiple criterion decision making model was first used to estimate the key influences of international airport performance in relation to sustainability. We first used the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) to establish a complex system illustrated as an influential-network-relationship-map. We next used the DANP (DEMATEL based on analytical network process) to confirm the influential weights. Then, we used a hybrid modified VIKOR to select and improve the performance gaps between the aspiration values and the current situation for the international airport. To demonstrate the proposed model, we applied it to three international airports in Taiwan as a case study. The outcomes indicate that airport image is the most crucial factor within the performance evaluation and that social perspective has the highest degree of net influence. The largest weighted gap when examining the aspiration value is public transport for the A2 airports and transparency of finance for the A1 and A3 airports. The implications for management are discussed.}

A SiC target was sputtered with a 1.2 KeV Ar+ ion beam delivered by a Kaufman-type ion source, and the growing films were simultaneously bombarded with 160 KeV Ar+ ions. The microstructural state of the samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and high-resolution TEM on cross-sectional preparations. X-ray reflectometry was used for the determination of the density of the SiC films. These characterizations show that the films are essentially polycrystalline and formed of very fine grains of the cubic β-SiC phase. It is found that the DIM treatment increases the size of the nanocrystallized grains as well as the film density. The crystallisation and densification processes produced by the DIM treatment are analyzed as a consequence of collisional effects. The calculations of the damage profile in the growing films indicate that the number of the displacements per target atom (dpa) is markedly above 1 dpa in the whole film thickness which is in agreement with the prediction of previous models.}

This does not properly reflect the heterogeneity among attributes. This paper presents a novel heterogeneous multi-attribute decision-making approach based on Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). A human-centric heterogeneous multi-attribute emergency decision-making framework is constructed based on Dempster-Shafer structures. The term “human-centric” is emphasized here as the proposed framework encompasses aspects specific to human judgments, specifications, or evaluations. Considering the differences in DM backgrounds and preferences, our framework incorporates a heterogeneous decision environment. DST allows DMs to express decision information in a manner closely consistent with human cognition. A series of parameters capture the subjective attitudes of DMs in our framework, the embodiments of which are manifold: (1) they reveal the sensitivity of DMs to alternative ranks in the process of basic probability assignment generation from decision information; (2) they reflect the tolerance of DMs to uncertainty in the process of weight calculation from belief entropy; and (3) they facilitate analysis of DMs in the decision process based on belief intervals. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a emergency decision-making application for medical supplier selection in the context of COVID-19.}

Most of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce software systems use tree- or wizard-like approaches to guide customers in configuring a customized product on Internet web pages. However, customers may feel confused while they are selecting components of a product from option lists, since they are usually not familiar with the technical details of these components. A few e-commerce sites use recommendation systems to provide suggested products for customers, but they have to maintain user profiles and have limitations such as new user problem and complexity. Therefore, they may not be suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises. This research proposes a new approach to help customers configure their expected products. By using this approach, once a customer inputs the levels of importance of requirements, total budget of the expected product, the software system can figure out a customized product which maximally meets the customer's expectations, and can also provide the suboptimal solutions for further selections. A mathematical model to formulate this optimization problem is established. A case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.}

This matrix of derivatives is derived directly by studying the variation of the DLT parameters caused by an infinitesimal change of the reference frame. This is achieved from the known corresponding variation of the bundle parameters and the known direct and inverse relations between DLT and bundle parameters.}

abstract = {Purpose
Before initiating the implementation of change for transforming and improving an organization through lean thinking (LT), it has to first select a right value stream. Several implementation studies have been documented in literature, but not many studies have addressed this issue of value stream selection. The purpose of this paper is to propose and empirically validate a framework for selecting a value stream to implement LT.
Design/methodology/approach
8A framework is proposed by reviewing the literature on LT implementation case studies. Single case study methodology has been adopted to validate the application of 8A framework for selecting a value stream in an Indian educational institute. Since multiple qualifiers are considered simultaneously, a multi-criteria decision-making approach has been employed for choosing the value stream.
Findings
Utility of the proposed 8A framework for value stream selection was confirmed through its successful application in an educational institute. Out of three alternatives in the case organization, the teaching alternative was chosen for further LT implementation based on the application of 8A framework. Qualitative cross-validation and sensitivity analysis also confirmed the robustness of the value stream selection made using the 8A framework.
Research limitations/implications
Framework proposed in this study comprehensively captures the important qualifiers that were overlooked by the widely adopted first tenet of LT. Future research can attempt to generalize the applicability of 8A framework in different contexts including manufacturing, healthcare, software development, etc. A further study can be carried out in two similar case organizations or in two value streams of the same case organization (say in two different plants) to compare the differences in the outcome of lean implementation when one chooses its value stream for LT implementation without the application of the proposed framework, while another chooses it by applying the 8A framework.
Practical implications
Through structured evaluation of the comprehensive set of qualifiers in 8A framework using a multi-criteria decision making model, an informed decision can be taken by the practitioners in selecting a value stream from the available alternatives before proceeding with the implementation of LT.
Originality/value
After questioning the existing procedure of value stream selection for LT implementation, this study is the first to propose and validate an 8A framework that overcomes the limitations of the existing procedure. Study is also unique in the choice of the case organization as not many research papers have documented implementation of LT from the context of educational institutes.}

Tape casting, K-square preparation, sintering and characterization were conducted. Slip viscosity, mechanical properties of the green tapes, green and sintered density of K-squares, and dielectric permittivity were analyzed as output responses using statistical analysis methods. Most of the green body properties from solvent-based system such as tensile strength, tape morphology and bulk density depended on the ceramic powder. While, dispersant was the most significant factor for the two water-based systems. The sintered properties such as microstructure and dielectric permittivity for the three systems depended significantly on the type of ceramic powder.

The central motivation of this research is establishing a strategic decision-making paradigm for optimizing renewable energy project (REP) portfolios, with a particular application to east China to quantify how HD influences a REP portfolio selection. The REP portfolio selection is subject to many unclear criteria and various sustainability goals. Fuzzy interval goal programming (FIGP) models are used to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty of the models' goals and coefficients. In this study, firstly, four objectives of social, economic, environmental, and technical criteria, as well as 12 sub-criteria were weighted by fuzzy ANP. Secondly, the potential REPs were assessed on these criteria to deal with the underlying ambiguities. Thirdly, the performance of potential projects was evaluated by the MABAC technique. Fourthly, a mixed-integer linear programming model was constructed and the FIGP is employed to form an optimal portfolio. Eventually, a sensitivity analysis was done to verify the validity of the suggested system. Based on this study's findings, HD is the most significant criterion. These innovative results will assist policymakers in better understanding the role of HD in the REP portfolio selection process.}

abstract = {The design of efficient public policies that aim to improve the provision of ecosystem services faces the problem that many ecosystem services are only apparent at spatial levels beyond the level at which they are managed. This makes it impossible to measure the contribution of individual resource managers to the provision of these services, as is the case in landscapes managed by private landowners such as farmers. As a consequence, the magnitude of the public support associated with the implementation of a policy cannot be specified down to the level of the individual manager/land owner. In this situation, institutional arrangements among resource managers are needed to determine how the public support defined at the higher level can be fairly distributed. This paper proposes a financial compensation arrangement among resource managers in a landscape, based on the Kaldor–Hicks criterion leading to a Pareto-optimal improvement, and explores the institutional requirements for the effective implementation of this arrangement. The proposed arrangement is illustrated with a case study in a woodland landscape in The Netherlands. The results show that private benefits among farms differed considerably due to biophysical, ecological and geographic differences among the farms. The financial compensation arrangement could contribute to improved equity among natural resource managers, which has been proposed as a key requirement for implementation of effective governance of environmental changes. The discussion addresses the institutional requirements of the proposed arrangement for governance structures that effectively deal with biophysical and socio-economic scale mismatches in sustainable use of natural resources.}

Acknowledging the importance of this concept, many healthcare organizations have implemented agility on their health care system. In this context, this study uses total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) for two purposes. First, it models the agile capabilities of a Moroccan healthcare organization in a hierarchical form by differentiating between the driving capabilities and the dependent ones. Second, it interprets the interrelationship among them and ranks the capabilities based on their influence on agility. Through a literature review, different capabilities of organization agility have been identified followed by a questionnaire circulated among different healthcare professionals. Results indicate the most agile capabilities that bring agility in the healthcare organizations in order to address those challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis.}

Selecting the supplier is a very critical part to the comprehensive performance of modern enterprises. With the large-scale development of straw biomass industry, green supplier selection has become a key decision-making task which needs to collect and process mass of information, it is necessary to make the supplier to go green. Nevertheless, it is safe to say, in fact, that so far there are a few researches on supplier selection in straw biomass industry. At the same time, some crucial problems urgently needed to be solved exist in present research, as shown below:①decision-making methods are frequently used, even though they have some serious problems, e.g. information loss.②some key index factors are ignored, green supplier selection hasn't got attracted sufficient attention.③little work has been performed on the fuzziness or the uncertainty of index weight. To solve the problems mentioned above, this paper tries to find out some ways to make improvements:①Cloud model is proposed to handle the fuzziness and randomness of evaluation information.②Index system is more comprehensive. Important issues, such as on-time delivery, pollutant emissions per unit fuel(t) and green certification, are paid more attention to.③Fuzzy AHP is applied to determine the index weight, the uncertainty of criteria and sub-criteria are considered, the vagueness of human thought is dealt with.④A decision framework based on Cloud model and possibility degree is put forward to guide the optimal selection of green supplier selection.⑤A Chinese case is carried out and related sensitivity analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed novel model not only can find the more suitable green supplier, but also reveal the big gap between alternatives clearly. The strength of the proposed new decision framework is proved.}

This paper was based on a numerical solution using the finite differences method. MATLAB has been used as a software language. The optical efficiency of the LFR solar receiver has reached 53.7% where the thermal efficiency has reached 37.5%, while the pressure drop within the absorber pipe has reached 02 bars. As for superheated steam temperatures variations, it ranged between 233.35 °C and 263.75 °C, knowing that the water steam inlet temperature when entering the absorber tube is equal to 140 °C. As for the overall coefficient of heat loss, its mean value is 5.84 W/m2.°C.

abstract = {Under the customization production environment, it is necessary for enterprises to offer more varieties of products to cope with the demands of different customers. However, the variation in the customized product specification often leads to problems in the enterprise such as an improper design or an uncoordinated manufacturing procedure that causes a much higher or loss. Therefore, enterprises will be able to take profits under control more precisely if they can tell whether the customer’s order is acceptable and estimate the new product cost. To deal with this issue, the authors attempt to develop an evaluation and decision-making system for the customized orders. In this study, customer’s orders are evaluated by a two-stage model. First, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for the initial screening of orders. While some orders can be directly accepted or rejected, others may need a double check by the business sectors and customers. In the acceptable orders, the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is used to pick up the case most similar to the new product case for the evaluation of product cost and price setting. At last, the PC product is used as an example to illustrate the proposed methodology. The building of an objective order screening system will help enterprises to make up proper strategies regarding the order selection.}

When dealing with an OHS risk analysis problem, how to assess the risk of occupational hazards is a crucial step and a big challenge. In this paper, we aim to develop a new OHS risk assessment model by integrating Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) and Alternative Queuing Method (AQM) to assess and rank the risk of occupational hazards for corrective actions. To this end, the PFSs are utilized to address the vague and uncertain assessment information provided by experts and an improved AQM is introduced to acquire the risk priority of the recognized occupational hazards. Furthermore, we extend the Best Worst Method (BWM) to derive the relative weights of risk criteria based on picture fuzzy information. Finally, a practical example of excavation in a construction yard is provided to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed OHS risk assessment model. The results indicate that the new risk assessment method is able to produce more reliable risk ranking results of occupational hazards, and provides a practical and effective way for risk analysis in OHS.}

Rather than focusing on specific contexts or industries, this paper aims to examine the intercorrelation and interdependencies between the barriers from a supply chain perspective. Therefore, the diverse conceptual background of the Circular Economy and the complexity of its implementation due to the interconnectedness of barriers that span regulatory, cultural, market, and technological aspects are analyzed. The interdependence of barriers in the different supply chain stages is highlighted in a qualitative and explorative research approach. The key findings reveal that a successful supply chain management strategy that integrates Circular Economy principles along the whole supply chain is crucial for successfully transitioning from a linear to a Circular Economy.

Its main mission is to transmit real-time volcanic data to a remote location, in order to aid to forecast volcanic eruptions, as well as avoiding the exposition of pilots and scientists to these dangerous flight conditions. During the conceptual design phase, classical and new design procedures were developed in order to determine the vehicle design requirements, in relation to its flight in a hard scenario like an active volcano. Likewise, the main geometric, aerodynamic, stability and performance parameters of the UAV were calculated and assessed through theoretical/analytical presizing and Computer-aided Design (CAD) methods. After obtaining the final concept, the aerodynamic design was carried out considering the constraints found in the previous design phase. In this way, an accurate estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients was developed, through analytical simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and wind tunnel testing. Results showed that the entire design process was consistent because the analytical, numerical and experimental results were greatly similar in the Lift (CL) and Drag (CD) coefficients. Furthermore, the UAV characteristics are within the limits of the design requirements, presenting several aerodynamic and performance advantages in comparison to other vehicles used in the same mission. This suggested that, on a large scale, the aerodynamic behavior of the UAV is suitable for performing the mission for which it was created. However, actual-environmental studies are still necessary in order to validate the reliability of the designed UAV.}

This paper presents a recently developed software, ArcGIS-based Nitrogen Load Estimation Toolkit (ArcNLET), for estimating nitrogen loading from septic systems to surface water bodies. The load estimation is important for managing nitrogen pollution, a world-wide challenge to water resources and environmental management. ArcNLET simulates coupled transport of ammonium and nitrate in both vadose zone and groundwater. This is a unique feature that cannot be found in other ArcGIS-based software for nitrogen modeling. ArcNLET is designed to be flexible for the following four simulating scenarios: (1) nitrate transport alone in groundwater; (2) ammonium and nitrate transport in groundwater; (3) ammonium and nitrate transport in vadose zone; and (4) ammonium and nitrate transport in both vadose zone and groundwater. With this flexibility, ArcNLET can be used as an efficient screening tool in a wide range of management projects related to nitrogen pollution. From the modeling perspective, this paper shows that in areas with high water table (e.g. river and lake shores), it may not be correct to assume a completed nitrification process that converts all ammonium to nitrate in the vadose zone, because observation data can indicate that substantial amount of ammonium enters groundwater. Therefore, in areas with high water table, simulating ammonium transport and estimating ammonium loading, in addition to nitrate transport and loading, are important for avoiding underestimation of nitrogen loading. This is demonstrated in the Eggleston Heights neighborhood in the City of Jacksonville, FL, USA, where monitoring well observations included a well with predominant ammonium concentrations. The ammonium loading given by the calibrated ArcNLET model can be 10–18% of the total nitrogen load, depending on various factors discussed in the paper.}

The findings of this paper are that the economy would begin its recovery in July–August, 2010. While forecasting is always hazardous, our 2001 paper successfully forecast the date the recovery began. Since 1920 the validating authority for the turnaround dates has traditionally been the widely recognized National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The Bureau usually releases an official statement with their finding many months after the event (and of course after the forecasts had been done). Our results on the month in which the recovery began in 2001 were confirmed by the NBER in July 2003. We will again await the NBER determination of the time of recovery from the current recession.}

The objective of the paper is to provide an overview on how German automotive companies currently deal with challenges and chances of a sustainable product development. The study obtained the following core conclusions: (1) A common understanding of the term sustainability is missing and a company-wide definition would be beneficial. (2) There is no consensus on the optimal organizational embedment for sustainability into a company. A centralized responsibility plus distributed awareness was identified as the most promising solution. (3) As a matter of supply and demand, automotive companies will not over-satisfy the customers’ demand. As dieselgate has boosted public interest, possible competitive advantages were identified by transforming the product property “sustainability” to a unique selling point. (4) There is an unmanageable amount of methods for the implementation of sustainability in the product development process. For that reason, academically developed methods are only rarely used in industry. (5) Companies are retrospectively evaluating the results of the development rather than using assessment outcomes systematically to improve the product prospectively. (6) Major potential drivers for sustainable product development are laws & politics, customers and competition. Sustainability could become more attractive for industry and customers by creating win-win-solutions. Conceivable propositions are tax advantages or Pigovian taxes, the internalization of sustainability, the shift from tank-to-wheel- towards holistic well-to-wheel-analyses or product service-systems.}

Special procedures have to be taken during the product development process to comply with recent green directives. Product structure is recognized as a critical factor that provides effective means for reducing environmental impact in product end-of-life. However, most previous studies failed to leverage the vast latitude at the design stage due to the assumption of a fixed product structure. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a CAD-based approach that allows automatic variation of 3D product structure by means of changing the combination of parts, selecting the assembly method, and rearranging the assembly sequence. A computing scheme uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to produce an optimal product structure from the design alternatives generated by the approach. This corresponds to lower assembly/disassembly costs, while complying with specified recycling and recovering rates. The scheme also chooses a smaller set of parts that needs to be disassembled and determines an economical disassembly process. Implemented in a commercial CAD system, the test results demonstrated the effectiveness of this scheme in green product design in a cost-effective manner.}

Firms may use loose coupling, integrator, cross-functional appointments/training, multifunctional teams and cultural indoctrination to promote interfunctional integration. It is hypothesized that effective interfunctional integration may be directly-related to value appropriation in commercializing innovations and indirectly related through effects on time-to-market and design and demand uncertainty. Interfunctional integration promotes reciprocal information flow among functions vital to the development, design and implementation of innovations. Therefore, it is a resource that can produce competitive advantage through the creation of value. Furthermore, such integration is very difficult to accomplish, and, therefore, its rarity and difficulty of imitation by competitors adds to competitive advantage. However, effective management of interfunctional integration is crucial or its costs may exceed its benefits. Theoretical propositions and suggestions for further research are presented.}

The purpose of this research is to investigate the different lifecycle costs associated with the use of green recycled plastic lightweight aggregates (GLACs) in concrete construction in different structural systems. For that purpose, the authors evaluated a concrete structure with several variable design systems and conducted structural design once using conventional concrete and once using concrete with recycled plastic aggregates, resulting in a total of 36 distinct scenarios. The lifetime cost analysis was performed on such scenarios. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine how structural characteristics and critical element costs influence cost-effectiveness. According to the findings, this approach can save up to 6% in life-cycle expenses. The findings of this research will contribute to the upcoming paradigm shift of using recycled plastic in concrete, which will reduce the environmental impacts of both the concrete and plastic industries while also assisting developers in lowering their life cycle costs.}

It provides a precise target for the identification of radical problems. Based on the core idea of Ideal Final Result and Breaking Boundary, a multilevel problem identification model is proposed. It identifies radical problems at a high system level based on the performance of problems at different levels. A framework is built for radical problems solving based on the alternative effect technology. Automated effect search tools and effect technologies provide the effective support for fast and creative problem-solving. The alternative effect technology further enhances the richness of solution resources. The proposed method clarifies the direction of radical innovation product design at the problem definition stage, which reduces uncertainties of the design process and increases the radical innovation success rate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by redesigning a wave power generator.}

abstract = {Technology roadmapping is a flexible technique that is widely used within industry to support strategic and long-range planning. The approach provides a structured (and often graphical) means for exploring and communicating the relationships between evolving and developing markets, products and technologies over time. It is proposed that the roadmapping technique can help companies survive in turbulent environments by providing a focus for scanning the environment and a means of tracking the performance of individual, including potentially disruptive, technologies. Technology roadmaps are deceptively simple in terms of format, but their development poses significant challenges. In particular the scope is generally broad, covering a number of complex conceptual and human interactions. This paper provides an overview of the origins of technology roadmapping, by means of a brief review of the technology and knowledge management foundations of the technique in the context of the fields of technology strategy and technology transitions. The rapidly increasing literature on roadmapping itself is presented in terms of a taxonomy for classifying roadmaps, in terms of both organizational purpose and graphical format. This illustrates the flexibility of the approach but highlights a key gap—a robust process for technology roadmapping. A fast-start method for technology roadmapping developed by the authors is introduced and described. Developed in collaboration with industry, this method provides a means for improved understanding of the architecture of roadmaps and for rapidly initiating roadmapping in a variety of organizational contexts. This paper considers the use of the roadmaps from two main perspectives. The first is a company perspective: roadmaps that allow technology developments to be integrated with business planning, and the impact of new technologies and market developments to be assessed. The second perspective is multiorganizational: roadmaps that seek to capture the environmental landscape, threats and opportunities for a particular group of stakeholders in a technology or application area. Two short illustrative cases show the fast-start method in use in the context of disruptive technological trends from these two perspectives.}

From a deductive introduction oriented to the societal scope of innovations, this inquiry proceeds empirically, for the first time analyzing seven interacting drivers of capital / labor substitution or labor displacement. Three time-phased response scenarios are related to levels of technological impact. Thereafter, inductive theorising probes workforce futures for both developed and developing countries, arguing that not only are immediate relations of capital and labor in flux but, more widely, so are industrial and market organisation, the global geo-economic order, and the human trajectory itself.}

abstract = {For product design and development, crowdsourcing shows huge potential for fostering creativity and has been regarded as one important approach to acquiring innovative concepts. Nevertheless, prior to the approach could be effectively implemented, the following challenges concerning crowdsourcing should be properly addressed: (1) burdensome concept review process to deal with a large amount of crowd-sourced design concepts; (2) insufficient consideration in integrating design knowledge and principles into existing data processing methods/algorithms for crowdsourcing; and (3) lack of a quantitative decision support process to identify better concepts. To tackle these problems, a product concept evaluation and selection approach, which comprises three modules, is proposed. These modules are respectively: (1) a data mining module to extract meaningful information from online crowd-sourced concepts; (2) a concept re-construction module to organize word tokens into a unified frame using domain ontology and extended design knowledge; and (3) a decision support module to select better concepts in a simplified manner. A pilot study on future PC (personal computer) design was conducted to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is promising and may help to improve the concept review and evaluation efficiency; facilitate data processing using design knowledge; and enhance the reliability of concept selection decisions.}

abstract = {Despite the many services and virtually infinite resources offered by cloud computing such as virtual reality and intelligent building surveillance, it still faces many problems when intervening several smart objects and devices in human's life. These problems are low latency, mobility and location awareness. For solving these problems of cloud computing, the fog and mobile edge computing have been introduced. The fog and mobile edge computing (FMEC) make services and resources close to users via moving from cloud data centers to the edge of the network. The dependability of FMEC depends on supplying centric services to users. The FMEC considered as a perfect paradigm to the above-mentioned purpose due to their ability to implement the ponderous real time applications directly at the network edge via billions of linked mobile devices. The FMEC faces some challenges as in any novel technology. These challenges are security (network security, data security, privacy of usage, data storage security, etc.) and administrative policies concerns. The critical problem which prohibit the development of FMEC is how to address dynamic varying of security services with the requirements of mobile's users. For handling this problem, we sought to provide a method for selecting the proper security service which is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this research, we provide a neutrosophic PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) technique for multi-criteria decision making problems to describe fuzzy information efficiently. For assessing the proposed methodology we applied it to a real case study to select proper security service for FMEC in the presence of fuzzy information.}

Here, we explore the social acceptability of forest-based biorefineries in Maine using random utility modeling to identify how project attributes and citizen characteristics interact to affect level of support. Using a statewide sample (Statewide) and a subsample of mill towns (Mill Towns), we found that: (1) in both samples, individual characteristics had similar coefficients and significance levels except for pro-environment attitudes; (2) the coefficients related to the industry’s negative attributes were notably different between the two samples, while positive attributes were not; (3) in both samples, positive industry attributes such as “producing products from a sustainable resource” and “increased economic development” were the most influential variables in determining the level of support for a new biorefinery in an individual’s community; and (4) in general, Mill Town respondents were more accepting of potential negative attributes such as increased levels of truck traffic, odor, noise, and air and water pollution.}

abstract = {Where there are calls for sustainable products, the inclusion of sustainability in formal approaches for new product development is still in its infancy. Firms face challenges in (i) managing development of new sustainable products that offer value to customers, (ii) reducing time-to-market and (iii) efficient use of resources. Contrastingly, the rationalisation found in lean product development that addresses these concerns, but not yet sustainability, has attracted the attention of many since its inception in the 1990s. The increasing adoption of lean product development by firms offers the opportunity to also include sustainability in its processes, methods and tools; this will allow new products to be economically profitable, ecologically correct, operationally safe, socially fair and culturally accepted. To this purpose, this paper performs a systematic literature review to find existing methods and tools of lean product development that contribute to sustainability. The findings lead to inference that there is not a lack of methods and tools, but their use. Furthermore, from an integral perspective of sustainability, just a few tools cover the social dimension or the three dimensions all together. Consequently, a holistic systems approach that bring integration and synergy to the use of methods and tools on sustainable product development to the table is needed.}

abstract = {This research provides insights into how sustainability considerations in engineering product design can be addressed through early stages of requirement management processes. Five key elements for successful implementation of sustainable product development from a requirement management perspective are presented, demonstrating how organisational sustainability maturity can be linked to the design and structure of a company’s operational management system. Through a thematic analysis of fifteen interviews with representatives from seven Swedish product developing-and manufacturing companies, critical activities and roles, examples of methods and tools utilisation and implementation, together with challenges and opportunities were identified. This empirical data was used to develop, test and refine a model in which key characteristics of sustainable product design and engineering design were coupled, resulting in a profile model for management of sustainability in requirements. Product developing companies can use the profile model as guidance towards necessary actions that enhance organisational sustainability maturity. Motivated by a low uptake rate of sustainability design tools in industry, this study brings attention to organisational capabilities for successful implementation of sustainable product development. As a lack of traceability is a potential cause, strategic socioecological contextualisation of needs is suggested to improve the chain of decision making in engineering design projects. The guiding research question was ‘What are sustainability requirements and how are they identified and managed in design projects?’. The main contribution is a proposed conceptualised model that aims to support design teams to identify and manage sustainability in requirements for engineering design projects. Future studies will test and validate the model.}
