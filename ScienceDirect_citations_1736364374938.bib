The study used a process framework approach and a systematic literature review to identify and classify various literature pertaining to IPSMs. In particular, the paper elaborates IPSMs summary taking into account different types of these projects and various types of decision-making method groups. The analysis is performed, including Scopus and Thompson/Reuters Web of Science databases, and determines possible gaps, issues and opportunities for further studies in the scope of the IPSM topic. The most important weaknesses of the analysed methods include: lack of approach that takes into account all IPs, lack of comprehensive criteria, lack of an appropriate method for calculating criteria weights, lack of group decision-making method, not considering limitations/constraints, failure to take into account the psychological conditions of decision-makers, failure to take into account the tendency to change assessments in the future.}

This requires strategies which support the cooperative creation, evaluation and evolution of global information flow structures among autonomous organizational units through local knowledge acquisition and maintenance. Three such strategies are presented: cooperative conceptual modeling, multi-simulation, and explicit process support. These strategies are formally embedded in a meta modeling framework and implemented with a repository-based architecture. They are intended for the analysis of business processes in networked organizations, and as a basis for designing and evolving their federated information systems.}

abstract = {Bearing in mind that making decisions in the aviation industry is usually related to the huge investment, it is evident that a small saving of a few percent is not negligible. Decisions usually need to be made while considering different, very often opposing criteria that could be both quantitative and qualitative. Therefore, decision makers need to apply multi-criteria decision making methods which will help them in the decision making process. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify and classify the problems in the aviation industry that are solved by using multi-criteria decision making. In this research, 166 papers published in the period from 2000 to 2018 are reviewed. The papers are divided according to the application area in four groups: airlines, airports, air traffic management, and others. Each group refers to specific stakeholder in aviation, and it is further divided by selected theme dealt with in papers reviewed, into evaluation, selection, ranking, improving and other. Moreover, the application areas have been systematically analysed and the results are presented in the paper. Finally, the results of this research indicate that: a) multi-criteria decision making methods are mostly used in airlines; b) evaluation is the most commonly present theme; c) fuzziness is incorporated in 50% of papers; d) Analytic Hierarchy Process (including fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) is applied in approximately 40% of reviewed papers; e) Taiwan ranks first as both authors’ affiliation country and presented case studies country.}

The most and least successful new products of US firms in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry were employed in this research. Our definition of “Organizational Integration” is the degree of cooperation and communication between internal and external new product development (NPD) “support” groups and NPD teams. “NPD Process Proficiency” is defined as how well NPD activities, stages, and the NPD process as a whole are performed. “New product market success” is depicted by four measures that encompass profit expectations, sales potential, success entering new markets, and entering existing markets with new products successfully. Our study is based on data obtained from survey instruments mailed to recipients such as New Product Development Managers who had already been designated by executives of our sample organizations. Our research reveals a number of interesting findings. Overall organizational integration between NPD teams and all other groups associated with an NPD effort was found to have a significant association with new product success. Moreover, it was determined that organizational integration has a significant correlation to the proficiency with which the various stages of the NPD process are performed. Additionally, the proficiency with which various stages of the NPD process were performed was noted to have a significant relationship with new product market success. Our study discovered a number of other findings that suggest important implications for both product development managers and scholars.}

In Canada, the province of Ontario has enacted regulations regarding the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Recycling program. The objective of this study is to develop a novel scenario-based robust possibilistic approach to optimize and configure an electronic reverse logistics network by considering the uncertainty associated with fixed and variable costs, the quantity of demand and return, and the quality of returned products. A Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to analyze the performance of our proposed model. Then, ANOVA test is conducted to statistically verify our model using the simulation results. The mathematical model is extended to the multi-objective optimization by maximising the environmental compliance of the third parties. The efficient solutions of the multi-objective model are computed using the two-phase fuzzy compromise approach. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the problem under investigation, we provide sensitivity analyses on the impact of different factors (e.g., recovery rates, capacity of facilities) on the total expected profit. Several interesting results were obtained, including the fact that increasing the capacity of facilities does not automatically translate into higher profits. Furthermore, by comparing the efficient solutions of deterministic and robust modes, we illustrate the impact of robustness price on the multi-objective model. The application of the proposed model is illustrated using a network in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Canada.}

The results for a national (U.S.) sample of industrial customers of conveyor belt systems support our central hypothesis: overall preference for the marketing mix offering of a given supplier is influenced positively by the distinctiveness of one or more elements in that supplier's marketing mix relative to its competitors. Distinctiveness is defined as the degree to which the customer perceives a supplier's product design quality, price, after-sale-service, and other marketing mix elements to be unique and valuable.}

abstract = {Remanufacturing of machine tools has become one of the crucial topical subjects as it can effectively reduce the manufacturing cost compared with traditional new product development. The assessment and selection of different remanufacturing alternatives are vital for successfully implementing the remanufacturing of machine tools. Although numerous fuzzy theory-based methods have been developed to evaluate and select the reasonable remanufacturing alternatives in the machine tool remanufacturing process, they still have some drawbacks, such as requiring extra assumptions, ignoring the impact of internal relationships among distinct criteria, and lacking the mechanism of manipulating diverse uncertain information. To cover such limitations, this study develops an applicable decision-making method to assist managers in extracting the essential remanufacturing alternatives for product improvement. First, a new concept named dual interval rough number clouds (DIRNCs) is developed by combining the merit of interval rough numbers (IRNs) and interval cloud model in handling uncertain information. Then, an applicable decision-making support model of remanufacturing alternatives is constructed based on DIRNCs, two non-linear weighting methods, and a technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Finally, an assessment of remanufacturing alternatives of machine tools is presented to illustrate the model, whose effectivity is demonstrated by comparing extant models. Results display that the developed DIRNC-based model is more advantageous than triangular fuzzy-based, cloud model-based, fuzzy rough-based, and IRN-based methods.}

abstract = {Conceptual design requires processing information from diverse sources in order to define the functional requirements, operating constraints, and evaluation criteria pertinent to accomplishing a prescribed goal. Historically, the design process focused on the functionality of an artifact for the end customer. Concurrent engineering broadens this focus to account for the concerns of ‘customers’ not previously considered — those along the entire life cycle of an artifact, i.e. marketing, design, manufacture, distribution, operation and disposal. Expanding the design focus to include all of these customers places far greater informational demands on the designer. Case-based reasoning applies experience stored in a computerized form to solving similar problems in slightly altered contexts. It has been applied successfully to routine design where both the form and the content of design information can be encoded symbolically and manipulated using artificial intelligence techniques. Concurrent conceptual design presents unique problems for such an approach because design information must be considered at many levels of abstraction and from many viewpoints. We describe an approach that provides the designer with case-based conceptual design information stored in the richly expressive medium of hypermedia (hypertext incorporating multimedia). Design cases of industry ‘best practices’ in concurrent engineering are indexed to provide access through multiple interfaces, allowing the user to browse, explore, or pinpoint design case information. The Conceptual Design Information Server (CDIS) is implemented using emerging internet standards, such as those associated with the World Wide Web (WWW) and Wide Area Information Service (WAIS), coupled to a robust Structured Query Language (SQL) database and traditional cad packages.}

However, they require a new certification approach. The traditional approach to certification is to prepare monolithic safety cases as bespoke developments for a specific system in a fixed configuration. However, this nullifies the benefits of flexibility and reduced rework claimed of IMA-based systems and will necessitate the development of new safety cases for all possible (current and future) configurations of the architecture. This paper discusses a modular approach to safety case construction, whereby the safety case is partitioned into separable arguments of safety corresponding with the components of the system architecture. Such an approach relies upon properties of the IMA system architecture (such as segregation and location independence) having been established. The paper describes how such properties can be assessed to show that they are met and trade-offs performed during architecture definition reusing information and techniques from the safety argument process.}

Elasticities at means are not substantively changed by demographic variables, but elasticities away from the means are sensitive to their inclusion.

TCIS highlights multiple dimensions of information sharing, including operational, organizational, and governance factors as well as timeliness and quality as key performance metrics. A case study approach was employed to examine the exchange of performance-related information in a key time information critical service: a county-wide emergency medical services (EMS) system. The paper first explains the theoretical foundations for the study, stemming from interorganizational systems (IOS) literature, e-government IOS, and even more specifically, IOS in emergency medical services (EMS). The paper discusses performance measures in EMS, describes the TCIS analytical lens, the study methodology, and the case study under investigation. Case study findings are reported along operational, organizational, and governance dimensions. In general, the case study illustrates promising factors that can enhance information sharing across organizations, while noting that considerable gaps remain in achieving an end-to-end IT-enabled performance approach. Future research should aim to better understand how to overcome these gaps, including addressing the usability constraints that can confront professionals working in time information critical circumstances, such as trauma conditions.}

Techniques based on the Total Quality Environmental Management (TQEM) philosophy (which is based on integrating Total Quality Management (TQM) methods and environmental management methods) are already being used by many organizations. This paper builds upon the TQEM concept (which emphasizes four basic elements: customer identification, continuous improvement, do the job right the first time and a systems approach to work) by showing how other principles used in quality management can also be applied to environmental management. The issues are then illustrated through a case study of a leading German manufacturer, Bosch-Siemens Hausgeräte GmbH.}

Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach with a case study of a Chinese electronic and equipment manufacturer.}

It was demonstrated that LSPM had a biphasic effect on both endogenous and exogenous TSH activity as measured by chick thyroid 32P uptake. When given 18h before autopsy, LSPM decreased TSH activity in both, whereas when LSPM was administered 42h or 44h before autopsy, TSH activity was significantly increased.}

Others stress that economic adjustment will reduce incentives to comply. We seek to reconcile these different literatures, modelling the target's decision to comply as a function of both (anticipatory) economic adjustment and Bayesian learning. We show that sanctions which do not work instantaneously (ie there is neither political compliance nor economic adjustment) can work in the long run, but only if the learning effect dominates the adjustment effect. A sufficient condition for ultimate compliance is that (potential) sanction damage that cannot be avoided by adjustment in the long run exceeds the yield of misconduct.}

However, the inherent complexity and uncertainty associated with evaluating supplier performance necessitate the use of fuzzy decision-making tools. This paper proposes the use of cubic intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CIFS) with four aggregation operators (AOs) based on Schweizer-Sklar (SS) t-norm and t-conorm: cubic intuitionistic fuzzy softmax Schweizer-Sklar weighted average (CIFSSSWA), cubic intuitionistic fuzzy softmax Schweizer-Sklar ordered weighted average (CIFSSSOWA), cubic intuitionistic fuzzy softmax Schweizer-Sklar weighted geometric (CIFSSSWG), and cubic intuitionistic fuzzy softmax Schweizer-Sklar ordered weighted geometric (CIFSSSOWG). The inclusion of pseudocodes increases practical application. An exhaustive sensitivity analysis assesses the influence of different parameters on the effectiveness of these techniques. The advantages of precision, efficiency, and execution time are underscored in the comparative analysis, which offers valuable insights that can inform more informed decision-making regarding the selection of green suppliers. The results demonstrate the efficacy of all the proposed approaches in providing a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of green suppliers. This study helps green supplier selection practices get better and gives practical advice to supply chain professionals who want to make their operations more sustainable.}

Based on a study of 25 leading business process change methods, it was determined that successful projects aim at improvements along multiple “strategic” dimensions and focus on mega business processes that span across the enterprise, often linking inter-organizationally. This type of strategy-driven business process change, introduced in this article through the Business Process Re-generation (BPR) method, begins with “generation” and “cultivation” of innovative strategies. It has more to do with systematizing a business process view into strategic planning, than it does with “engineering.” By significantly improving a firm's operating capabilities, Business Process Re-generation allows the implementation of new strategies and, even more importantly, leads to envisioning of entirely new strategic options.}

From hot marine sediments (depth: 106 m) at the Kolbeinsey Ridge, Iceland, novel bacterial hyperthermophiles were isolated. Cells were Gram-negative highly motile rods exhibiting a complex envelope consisting of murein, an outer membrane and a surface protein layer. Growth occurred between 67 and 95 °C (opt.: 85 °C; 75 min doubling time), pH 5.4 and 7.5 (opt.: pH 6.8), and 1 to 5% NaCl (opt.: 3% NaCl). The novel isolates were strict chemolithoautotrophs. They used molecular hydrogen, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron donors and oxygen (low concentrations) and nitrate as electron acceptors. During growth, sulfuric acid was formed from S° and thiosulfate. In the late logarithmic growth phase, H2S was formed from S° and H2. The core lipids consisted mainly of alkyl ethers of glycerol. The GC content of the DNA was 40 mol%. By 16S rRNA comparisons, the new isolates did not belong to any of the phyla known and represent the deepest phylogenetic branch-off within the Bacteria domain. Based on the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolates, we describe here a new genus, which we name Aquifex (the “water-maker”). The type species is Aquifex pyrophilus (type strain: Kol5a; DSM 6858).}

For effective utilization of the capabilities of different NTM processes, utmost care is needed for the selection of the most suitable process for a given machining application. Due to the lack of experienced experts in the domain of NTM processes, there is a need for a simple scientific/mathematical tool for selecting the most suitable NTM process when a particular shape feature is to be generated on a given work material. This paper focuses on the development of a two-phase decision model in this aspect. In the first phase, the most efficient NTM processes are selected for a given shape feature and work material combination having the best combination of performance parameters with the help of input-minimized-based Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) model of data envelopment analysis (DEA). In the second phase, those efficient NTM processes are ranked in descending order of priority using the weighted-overall efficiency ranking method of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) theory. Two real time machining applications are cited which prove the applicability, versatility and adaptability of this two-phase NTM process selection decision-making model as the results are quite consistent with those as derived by the past researches.}

So understood, behavioral contagion may be involved in criminality, conduct disorder, drug abuse, suicide, and teenage pregnancy. Previous papers have shown that contagion generates highly distinctive result patterns, from which its presence may be inferred. The patterns concern prevalence in sibships of different size and, in case-control designs, the number of susceptible sibs that affected and unaffected individuals have. The present paper extends the analysis by allowing the likelihood of transmission from one sib to another to vary according as the two sibs are of the same or opposite gender, male or female, single borns or co-twins, fraternal or identical twins. The extension is illustrated by application to data on criminality in Danish twins previously reported by other workers. We will show that the distribution of criminality by gender and zygosity is better explained in terms of behavioral contagion than by previous analyses.}

abstract = {In this study, a combined application of strain-energy density failure theory and a coupled model of thermo-elastic-plastic large deformation for analysing ductile fracture that may occur in the upsetting process is described. Using this coupled model, the stress, strain and strain-energy density distributions can be determined. The flow stress in this model is taken as a function of strain, strain rate and temperature. Temperature predictions in the proposed model agree quite well with those of Phol's experiment (W. Pohl, Doctoral Dissertation, University of Stuttgart, F.R.G. (1972)). Using the strain-energy density criterion and the strain-energy density distributions, the site of fracture initiation is located by finding the relative maximum of the minimum strain-energy density function, (dW/dV)minmax. The site of fracture initiation, using this method, is predicted to be located near the equatorial surface region of a cylindrical specimen during cold forging. Once the strain-energy density at the fracture site reaches the critical value of the material, (dW/dV)c, damage is considered to have occurred and the simulation is terminated. The influences of various combinations of specimen geometry and platen friction conditions on the workability of the material are also discussed. The calculated results of the terminations of strain at the state of fracture in the upsetting process are consistent with the experimental results of Kuhn et al.}

However, the ways learning can be effective in such environments warrents research, especially for teams developing new products under rapidly changing technological and market conditions. Interestingly, recent new product development (NPD) literature demonstrates the essential role of improvisation (i.e., planning and executing any action simultaneously) and unlearning (i.e., changes in team beliefs and project routines) for effective learning and performing under turbulent conditions. However, the combined effect of team improvisation and unlearning on new product success (NPS) has largely been ignored. This paper investigates the nomological relations among team improvisation and unlearning, new product success, and environmental turbulence, and contributes to the literature on NPD team learning, and on team flexibility under turbulent conditions. By examining 197 new product-development projects, we found that (1) environmental turbulence positively affects team unlearning, (2) team unlearning concurrently stimulates team improvisation, (3) team improvisation positively impacts new product success by utilizing/implementing new knowledge acquired by unlearning and improvisation. We further discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our conclusions.}

This paper proposes a multi-layer heterogeneous network-based method for product requirement development to identify key requirements in the product development process and address the complex relationships among users, requirements, products, and requirement development teams. By incorporating the theory of hesitant fuzzy into the expert decision-making process, this method constructs four single-layer networks: user attention network, expert trust network, requirement correlation network, and component combination network, which assigns realistic significance to nodes in each network layer and establishes connections between different networks, forming a multi-layer heterogeneous network model for product requirement development. Furthermore, this paper defines indicators such as layer significance and node comprehensive significance and proposes a calculation method for node comprehensive significance based on biased random walk, which enables deep integration of node’s realistic significance and topological centrality. The proposed method is applied to a data experiment of product requirement development for a specific type of new energy vehicle. By analyzing the calculation results of node comprehensive significance, high-quality recommendations are provided for the development team from the perspectives of functional requirements, product components, and user groups. Moreover, comparative experiments to assess algorithm performance demonstrate that the average accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 0.95, which is significantly higher than that of the commonly used single-layer network node centrality measurement methods and recently proposed multi-layer network node centrality measurement methods. These results reflect the advancement and applicability of the proposed method in product development scenarios.}

Linguistic Z-number (LZN) is widely used for evaluating fuzzy information due to its unique flexibility and accuracy. However, in the LZN environment, aggregation operators, as an important component of decision-making, also have some shortcomings. Some aggregation operators currently used in LZN environments have low flexibility, high computational complexity, and are not convenient. This article cleverly utilizes Aczel Alsina t-norm and t-norm to obtain some aggregation operators with good algebraic properties, and proves these properties, which can also reflect the psychological influence of decision-makers.

To continually improve, we must examine not only our innovation performance, but the processes with which we develop and exploit these innovations. Vittorio Chiesa, Paul Coughlan, and Chris Voss present a framework for auditing technical innovation management. Their auditing methodology goes beyond performance measurement by highlighting problems and needs, and providing information that can be used in developing action plans for improving performance. The foundation of their audit methodology is a process model of technical innovation. The model addresses the managerial processes and the organizational mechanisms through which innovation is performed. Underlying this method is the notion that success in innovation is related to good practice in the relevant management processes. The model identifies four core processes: concept generation, product development, process innovation, and technology acquisition. Supporting these core processes are three enabling processes: the deployment of human and financial resources, the effective use of appropriate systems and tools, and senior management leadership and direction. The outcome from these core and enabling processes is performance in terms of innovation and the resulting competitiveness in the marketplace. This model provides the basis for a detailed audit of current innovation practice and performance. The audit has two dimensions: the process audit assesses whether the processes necessary for innovation are in place and the degree to which best practice is used; and the performance audit focuses on the outcomes of each core and enabling process and of the overall process of technological innovation and its effect on competitiveness. The performance audit helps identify needs and problems, but it doesn't explain why gaps exist between current and required performance and it doesn't provide an action plan for closing these gaps. The process audit meets these needs. The audit methodology uses a two-level approach: a rapid assessment based on innovation scorecards and an in-depth audit. These scorecards provide an overview of the company's strengths and weaknesses with regard to technical innovation management, highlighting those areas that require in-depth examination. The in-depth audit identifies not only the processes, but the areas within each requiring attention.}

abstract = {Nicollian and Goetzberger's well known integral expression for the equivalent parallel conductance due to interface states Gp/ω has been given a simple analytical representation which is valid under the condition that interface potential fluctuation parameter σ > 1.5. Previous methods of conductance analysis based upon numerical and/or graphical construction are provided with alternative analytic relations. The earlier parametric numerical relations like ξp, fw, fD and ln(ξ+/ξ−) vsσ are described very well by analytic expressions in this paper. A new relation is presented to determine interface state time constant from the width of conductance peak. A new method is presented to determine dependence of σ on interface band bending from Gp/ω vs bias measurements at just two frequencies. The expedient method of Nicollian, Goetzberger and Lopez utilises the same two curves to determine distribution of interface state density Nss and capture cross section σp across the band gap. Therefore using the present new method for σ determination and other analytical relations for Nss and σp determination, the expediency of their method is greatly enhanced. Complete conductance analysis for rapid characterization of the interface is shown to become now a simple straight forward affair, and the amount of data required is also substantially reduced.}

abstract = {The rapid development and application of smart technologies have trigged manufacturers’ servitization towards a new paradigm − smart product service system (PSS). Accurate selection of design alternatives are significantly vital to successful development project of smart PSS. This study establishes a new criteria system considering the value symbiosis among stakeholders and the smart capabilities generated using smart technologies. Since the proposed criteria system incorporates two types of criteria: cost-based and benefit-based, data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is more suitable for alternatives evaluation over other methods by requiring less information, fitting multiple data scales and not needing criteria weights. However, the previously developed DEA methods rarely simultaneously consider the intrapersonal linguistic vagueness and interpersonal preference randomness inherently involved in the selection process, which may lead to inaccurate and distorted results. Therefore, this study proposes a novel rough-fuzzy DEA method to select the suitable smart PSS design alternatives, integrating the strength of fuzzy number in capturing intrapersonal uncertainty and the feasibility of rough number in perceiving the interpersonal uncertainty. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a case study of smart conditioner service system and its comparisons with other methods.}

abstract = {In risk assessment and decision analysis, the analytical network process (ANP) is widely used to assess the key factors of risks and analyze the impacts and preferences of decision alternatives. There are lots of comparison matrices for a complicated risk assessment problem, but a decision has to be made rapidly in emergency cases. However, in the ANP, the reciprocal pairwise comparison matrices (RPCM) are more complicated and difficult than AHP. The consistency test and the inconsistent elements identification need to be simplified. In this paper, a maximum eigenvalue threshold is proposed as the consistency index for the ANP in risk assessment and decision analysis. The proposed threshold is mathematically equivalent to the consistency ratio (CR). To reduce the times of consistency test, a block diagonal matrix is introduced for the RPCM to conduct consistency tests simultaneously for all comparison matrices. Besides, the inconsistent elements can be identified and adjusted by an induced bias block diagonal comparison matrix. The effectiveness and the simplicity of the proposed maximum eigenvalue threshold consistency test method and the inconsistency identification and adjustment method are shown by two illustrative examples of emergent situations.}

Though this theme has strong antecedents in Marxist-inspired critique of ideology, research into this theme has employed diverse approaches; among them, genealogical studies (e.g., Miller and O’Leary, 1987), deconstructive studies (e.g., Shearer and Arrington, 1993), psychoanalytic studies (Roberts, 1991, Roberts, 2009) and critical-rational studies (e.g., Power and Laughlin, 1996). We offer a different approach grounded in social-cognitive concerns with how implicit attitudes about race influence evaluation of others. We report on the results of an empirical, lab-based study of balanced scorecard evaluations and bonus allocations where race is a treatment effect and where the well-established tenets of Implicit Association Testing (IAT) are used to reveal that there are, indeed, propensities to unwillingly let racial prejudice intervene into our accounting-based evaluations of others. That intervention influences identity in ways that are morally unacceptable, degrading to black workers, and loaded with potential for negative material consequences for workers (e.g., less compensation due to racially determined and irrational performance evaluations). The paper illustrates one area of research in which methodologies adapted from conventional empirical, statistical approaches can enhance the emancipatory potential of critical accounting research.}

Hence, the objective of this study is to develop a method for spa hotel segmentation and travel choice prediction by applying machine learning approaches. Method evaluation is conducted through a collection of datasets from travelers’ ratings and textual reviews of spa hotels on several features in TripAdvisor.

In turn, companies have revamped their NPD processes and organizational structures to deploy cross-functional teams. These efforts toward interfunctional integration have produced a more responsive NPD process, but they don’t represent the endgame in the quest for more effective NPD. What’s next after the interfunctional walls come down? Pointing out that many high-tech firms have already taken such steps as integrating customers and suppliers into the NPD process, Avan Jassawalla and Hemant Sashittal suggest that such firms need to go beyond integration and start thinking in terms of collaboration. Using information from a study of 10 high-tech industrial firms, they identify factors that seem to increase cross-functional collaboration in NPD, and they develop a conceptual framework that relates those factors to the level of cross-functional collaboration achieved in the NPD process. Compared to integration, collaboration is described as a more complex, higher intensity cross-functional linkage. In addition to high levels of integration, their definition of cross-functional collaboration includes the sense of an equal stake in NPD outcomes, the absence of hidden agendas, and a willingness on the part of participants to understand and accept differences while remaining focused on the organization’s common objectives. Collaboration also involves synergy—that is, the NPD outcomes exceed the sum of the capabilities of the individual participants in the NPD process. Their framework suggests that structural mechanisms such as cross-functional teams can provide significant increases in NPD-related interfunctional integration. However, high levels of integration do not necessarily equate to high levels of collaboration. Characteristics of the organization and the participants also affect the level of collaboration. For example, achieving a high level of collaboration depends on participants who contribute an openness to change, a willingness to cooperate, and a high level of trust. Their framework also points to key organizational factors that affect the level of collaboration—for example, the priority that senior management gives to NPD and the level of autonomy afforded to participants in the NPD process.}

In this method, the decision maker’s preferences are given through pair-wise alternatives’ comparisons with fuzzy truth degrees, which are expressed with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs). Real numbers, intervals, and TrFNs are used to express heterogeneous decision information. Giving the fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions, we define TrFN-type fuzzy consistency and inconsistency indices based on the concept of the relative closeness degrees. The attribute weights are estimated through constructing a new fuzzy linear programming model, which is solved by using the developed fuzzy linear programming method with TrFNs. The relative closeness degrees of alternatives can be calculated to generate their ranking order.

L'influence de l'absorption de rayonnement sur le profil de température et le transport de chaleur dans un milieu absorbant s'écoulant dans un tuyau annulaire, a été examinée analytiquement. Dans l'analyse, un écoulement turbulent d'un gaz non gris avec une densité variable et des coefficients d'absorption dépendant de la température est considéré. Les résultats de l'analyse sont comparés avec ceux d'une expérience effectuée avec de la vapeur d'eau s'écoulant à des nombres de Reynolds voisins de 20 000 à des pressions de 1 et 3,22 atm dans un tuyau annulaire avec un rapport de rayons de 0,2.

Das analytische Ergebnis stimmt mit dem Versuchsergebnis dahingehend überein, dass für eine Temperatur der Innenwand von 837°C und einem Druck von 3,22 atm die Strahlungsabsorption die Temperatur geringfügig erhöht (ungefähr 7 %).

In a manufacturing enterprise, it is crucial for supply chain managers to select an appropriate supplier for their long-term development prospects to and to pursue the business strategy and remain in a competitive position. Green supplier selection (GSS) can be viewed as a multiple-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem that involves many unmeasurable and conflicting criteria. Considering the advantage of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) in modeling such complexity and uncertainty, this study provides an integrated methodology to address MCGDM problems based on the best-worst method (BWM) and the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique in an interval type-2 fuzzy environment. First, we extend a new decision-making method called the BWM to IT2FSs. Unlike the BWM and fuzzy BWM, our IT2FSs stem from a questionnaire survey and related interval approaches. Second, we develop an integrated model based on interval type-2 fuzzy BWM and VIKOR to solve MCGDM problems. Finally, we present a GSS example to illustrate on the performance of our approach. We also provide sensitivity and comparative analyses and a discussion of the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.}

Because of the wide discrepancy between the predicted values and the experimental values of the transient burning rate of composite propellant when the gas-phase is in the unsteady state, a model was proposed which can be applied to both compression and depressurization that takes into account the unsteadiness of the gas-phase. In this model, the energy liberation at the surface of the propellant is maintained constant. The predicted values of the transient burning rate agree very well with the available experimental results.}

This essay begins with an examination of object-oriented software design (OOD) and how it compares with traditional algorithmic design. The discussion reviews the major elements of an object-oriented system and discusses how these elements support the development of complex software systems using examples from manufacturing as support. This is followed by a discussion of the steps to use as one approach to object-oriented design. The paper concludes with a review of object-oriented manufacturing systems reported in the literature.}

abstract = {The effects of cold rolling on the martensitic transformation of an equiatomic TiNi alloy have been studied by internal friction and shear modulus measurements, hardness test and TEM observation. The martensite stabilization can be induced by cold rolling at room temperature. A variety of deformed martensite structures has been observed. Both deformed martensite structures and deform-induced dislocations/vacancies are considered to be related to the martensite stabilization. The hardness test results also support this viewpoint. After the occurrence of the first reverse martensitic transformation of B19′ → B2, the martensite stabilization dies out and the transformation temperatures are depressed by retained dislocation on subsequent thermal cycles. Experimental results indicate that the martensite stabilization can depress the rate of martensitic transformation in the equiatomic TiNi alloy.
Résumé
L'effet du laminage à froid sur la transformation martensitique d'un alliage TiNi équivolumique a été étudié par des mesures de frottement intérieur et de module de cisaillement, par des essais de dureté et par des observations en MET. La stabilisation de la martensite peut être induite par le laminage à la température ambiante. Diverses structures sont observées dans la martensite déformée. Les structures de la martensite déformée, comme les dislocations et les lacunes induites par la déformation, sont supposées liées à la stabilisation de la martensite. Les résultats des tests de dureté confortent ce point de vue. Une fois survenue la première transformation martensitique inverse B19′ → B2, la stabilisation de la martensite disparaît complètement, et les températures de transformation diminuent au cours des cycles thermiques ultérieurs à cause des dislocations encore présentes. Les résultats expérimentaux montrent que la stabilisation de la martensite peut diminuer la vitesse de la transformation martensitique dans l'alliage TiNi équivolumique.
Zusammenfassung
Der Einfluβ des Kaltwalzens auf die martensitische Umwandlung in einer gleichatomigen Legierung TiNi wird mittels innerer Reibungsexperimente, Messungen des Schermoduls, Härtemessungen und elektronenmikrostkopischer Beobachtungen bestimmt. Der Martensit kann durch Walzen bei Raumtemperatur stabilisiert werden. Es findet sich eine Vielfalt von martensitischen Strukturen. Im Zusammenhang mit der Martensitstabilisierung werden sowohl verformte Martensitstrukturen wie auch verformunsinduzierte Versetzungen und Leerstellen diskutiert. Die Härtemessungen stützen diese Sicht ebenfalls. Nach Auftreten der ersten martensitischen Rückumwandlung von B19′ → B2 hört die Martensitstabilisierung auf; die Umwandlungstemperaturen werden bei nachfolgenden Temperaturzyklen abgesenkt durch zurückgeliebene Versetzungen. Die experimentellen Ergebnisse zeigen, daß die Martensitstabilisierung die Rate der Martensitumwandlung in der gleichatomigen Legierung TiNi absenken kann.}

However, large quantities of this SQG hazardous waste are disposed of in sanitary landfills and discharged to public sewers and these facilities are typically not designed to handle hazardous waste.

Although an alternative ranking is available, specific portfolio and optimal investment ratios cannot be obtained by using the qualitative decision-making methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model based on the max-score rule and the hesitant fuzzy linguistic element with variable risk appetite (HFLE-RA). The HFLE-RA is able to express qualitative evaluation information by using the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set and describe the variable investor risk appetites by introducing the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. Thus, different investors can be distinguished by the risk appetite parameters according to the asymmetric sigmoid semantics, and the optimal investment ratios can be obtained by applying the proposed portfolio model. Moreover, the investment opportunities and efficient frontiers of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic portfolio model are investigated. Also, a value-at-risk fitting approach is introduced to calculate the risk appetite parameters. Based on these works, a qualitative investment ratio calculation process is provided in the HFLE-RA environment. Lastly, a real example of calculating the optimal investment ratios for four newly listed stocks in the Growth Enterprises Market board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is provided to demonstrate the proposed approaches.}

Considered by practitioners as one of the main SC coordination problems, this paper considers the strategic supplier selection problem. Fuzzy set is used in order to address the imprecision of supply chain partners in formulating the preferences values of various selection criteria. The problem is formulated as a multi-stakeholder multi-criteria (MSMC) decision making problem and solved using two novel approaches. The first hybrid approach combines the fuzzy consensus-based possibility measure and fuzzy TOPSIS method. The second hybrid approach combines the fuzzy consensus-based neat OWA and goal programming model where, the inclusion and participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process is explicit. For each approach, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation (CCSD) based objective weight determination model is used to compute the criteria weights. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approaches, a simple example of strategic supplier selection problem is presented and the numerical results analyzed. Moreover, for each approach, the deviations between individual solutions and collective solution are evaluated using the Levenshtein distance. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are listed.}

Information was obtained concerning the most and least successful new products of U.S. firms in the medical instruments, the electrical equipment, and the heavy construction equipment industries. The field survey approach was utilized in which surveys were mailed to recipients such as new product development managers who already had been designated by executives of the sample firms. Several important findings were uncovered during this research. Overall organizational integration was found to be significantly associated with new product market success. Internal integration, the coordination between new product development teams and functional departments, was found to be significantly related to product market success. A significant relationship between new product development proficiency during the NPD “post-launch stage” and the degree of integration between an NPD team and external NPD organizations, such as customers and suppliers, was detected. During the post-launch stage, new product development proficiency also was found to be significantly related to new product market success. These findings suggest several important implications for new product development managers and scholars.}

However, the roughness of the metal surfaces, together with the thinnness of the specimen, produce highly irregular surfaces upon fracturing, and thus yield fragile metal replicas. The techniques described here for stabilizing the replicas, initially with an open mesh grid and finally with a Formvar film, provide a means for obtaining a high percentage of intact replicas from which complementary images can be prepared. With the aid of the montages, complementary regions on the replicas can be located at some later time, usually in less than 1 hr. The complementary images obtained are excellent for evaluating the factors which influence the quality and resolution of the replicas—such as heating and plastic deformation—and for describing the preservation of biological structures. Regions within the specimen which display unacceptable ice crystal growth or damage can be easily and confidently identified in complementary images.}

Both fuzzy DEA and fuzzy TOPSIS are applied to a common dataset of logistics service providers in Sweden. The results reveal that TOPSIS outperforms DEA in terms of both calculation complexity and sensitivity to changes in the number of suppliers. However, output rankings from the two models are found to be less than perfectly correlated. The paper concludes that utilizing both methods, as applied to just a small number of evaluation criteria and a relatively low level of detail in the data, produces a useful pooled shortlist of potential sustainable suppliers. This can then form the basis for a second stage application where either of the methods may be applied to a greater number of criteria that are specified to a higher level of detail. Even more critically, the results also have the potential to point to specific aspects for discussion when negotiating price and service quality commitments with potential sustainable suppliers.}

BPR was introduced in manufacturing/service industries with the objective of changing the management of the supply chain. In manufacturing, the nature of material flow determines the type of information and decision support systems required to achieve system integration and hence the overall effectiveness of the system. A conceptual model has been developed in this paper to illustrate the role of information systems in BPR and the type of information systems required to integrate functional areas in manufacturing. Hammer's (1990) message “Reengineering work: don't automate, obliterate” stresses a radical process simplification as the way to reduce time and cost, and to eliminate or at least simplify processes, not just speed them up. There has been tremendous interest on how to simplify the process and hence the information system required for effective management of material flow in manufacturing. The implementation of BPR using innovative application of information technology (IT) aims at flexible, team-oriented, and cross-functionally co-ordinated management. A framework has been presented in the paper to design a more effective BPR system with the help of advanced IT. Finally, a summary and conclusions are presented.}

We examine this hypothesis in the context of Walmart Supercenters, whose advancements in retail logistics have translated to substantial reductions in the prices of food and other consumer goods. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System matched with Walmart Supercenter entry dates and locations, we examine the effects of Supercenters on body mass index (BMI) and obesity. We account for the endogeneity of Walmart Supercenter locations with an instrumental variables approach that exploits the unique geographical pattern of Supercenter expansion around Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. An additional Supercenter per 100,000 residents increases average BMI by 0.24 units and the obesity rate by 2.3% points. These results imply that the proliferation of Walmart Supercenters explains 10.5% of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s, but the resulting increase in medical expenditures offsets only a small portion of consumers’ savings from shopping at Supercenters.}

A three phase methodology is used for presenting a framework for supplier selection by large organizations, the first phase involves the selection of criteria of green innovation through literature review and interviews with decision makers, the second phase involves ranking of selection criteria using a novel best worst method, third phase involves ranking of suppliers with respect to selection criteria weights obtained in phase two using fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Sensitivity analysis is also performed in order to check the robustness of the framework and eliminate the effect of biasness. The outcome of this research is helpful to rank the suppliers consequently organizations can replicate the proposed framework for supplier selection for their new product range.

Montoya-Weiss, and Jeffrey B. Schmidt provide such a balanced perspective in a study of cross-functional cooperation during NPD in Mexican high-tech firms. Notwithstanding the differing functional goals, objectives, and reward systems present in R&D, manufacturing and marketing, they hypothesize that all three functions recognize that successful NPD requires crossfunctional cooperation. In particular, they expect that representatives of these three functional groups will share similar perceptions, regarding both the drivers and the consequences of cross-functional cooperation. The survey results support the hypothesis that R&D, manufacturing, and marketing professionals share the same perceptions, regarding the drivers and the consequences of cross-functional cooperation. Respondents from all three groups view internal facilitators as the drivers of cross-functional cooperation. In other words, regardless of their functional area, the survey respondents believe that the strongest, most direct effects on cross-functional cooperation and NPD performance come from a firm's evaluation criteria, reward structures, and management expectations. Respondents perceive these internal facilitators as having a greater effect on cross-functional cooperation than that of external forces such as market competitiveness and technological change. In fact, contrary to expectations, the respondents do not view these external forces as having a significant effect on cross-functional cooperation or NPD performance. And contrary to persistent reports about friction between technical and nontechnical personnel, all three groups perceive a strong, positive relationship between cross-functional communication and NPD performance.}

abstract = {Recovery of diltiazem as diltiazem malate in a l-malic acid containing aqueous strip stream from an alkaline aqueous feed solution has been studied using a hollow fiber contained liquid membrane (HFCLM) separation-reaction device. The resistance to mass transfer is primarily controlled by the feed side mass transfer coefficient due to the high partition coefficient of diltiazem for a decyl alcohol liquid membrane and the instantaneous reaction in the strip side of the membrane. However, for larger thicknesses of the liquid membrane, the membrane resistance becomes quite important. In spite of the very low diltiazem concentration in the feed solution, high concentrations of diltiazem malate in the stripping solution were achieved by using a high l-malic acid concentration and recirculation of the strip solution from a batch reservoir. A first order model describes effectively the observed behavior of the HFCLM separation-reaction device. A preliminary cost analysis and comparison with packed bed solvent extraction shows the technique to be highly competitive.}

abstract = {Due to policy promotion towards new energy vehicles, battery supplier evaluation, as a critical multi-faceted decision problem, is the foundation of the good quality of products or service and further long-term development of enterprises. Most of methods have been proposed to measure the performance of potential candidates from the sustainable dimension, but they may ignore resilient and smart criteria, i.e., risk resistance capacity and smart technologies application, relating to normal supply and product reliability. Additionally, prior studies mainly report on the priority of suppliers from perfect rationality of the decision maker, but they pay little attention to indifference and incomparability relations between suppliers and bounded rationality of the decision maker. Therefore, this paper proposes an outranking based multi-criteria behavioral decision making method, named as prospect theory-based distributed linguistic ORESTE method to portray three outranking relations, preference, indifference and incomparability, from the view of bounded rationality of the decision maker. This approach adopts linguistic distribution to reveal the uncertain preference along with good flexibility and adaptability. It is applied to the battery supplier selection in new energy vehicles enterprises. Comparative analysis indicates the availability and superiority and sensitivity analysis verifies its stability.}

To this aim, ELECTRE I, an outranking based MCDM approach is extended with VIKOR method, an ideal solution based approach, under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The methodology utilizes pairwise comparison and outranking relation concepts of ELECTRE methods to construct different concordance and discordance sets in order to reflect preferences of decision makers effectively. By the help of similarities between concordance and discordance characteristics of ELECTRE and maximum group utility and minimum individual regret characteristics of VIKOR, the methodology enables the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE to overcome its weakness in ranking process and presents complete ranking. In addition, this study employs entropy method to identify the weights of criteria and decision makers, and weighted distance approach to determine the weights of different concordance sets. Utilizing these methods leads to specifying these weights objectively. The applicability of the proposed approach is explored by an illustrative example on supplier selection problem by explaining the method step by step. Furthermore, four computational experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate its applicability to the other areas and the results are compared.}

abstract = {The execution performance of an information gathering plan can suffer significantly due to remote I/O latencies. A streaming dataflow model of execution addresses the problem to some extent, exploiting all natural opportunities for parallel execution, as allowed by the data dependencies in a plan. Unfortunately, plans that integrate information from multiple sources often use the results of one operation as the basis for forming queries to a subsequent operation. Such cases require sequential execution, an inefficiency that can erase prior gains made through techniques like streaming dataflow. To address this problem, we present a technique called speculative plan execution, an out-of-order method that capitalizes on knowledge gained from prior executions as a means for overcoming remaining data dependencies between plan operators. Our approach inserts additional plan operators that generate and confirm speculative results, while preserving the safety and fairness of overall execution. To increase the utility of speculative execution, we propose a method of value prediction that combines caching with the more effective and space-efficient techniques of classification and transduction. We present experimental results that demonstrate how the performance of information gathering plans can benefit from speculative execution and how its overall utility can be increased through our hybrid method of value prediction.}

The model undergoes three steps to break to the SM by means of the specified Higgs multiplets. The model few parameters can elegantly accommodate whole mass spectra for all the particles at the electroweak scale, especially, two different flavor mixing for the quark and lepton sectors are reproduced in agreement with the current experimental data very well. The strong CP violation is excellently explained. The matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe is successfully implemented through the B−L violating decays of the superheavy gauge bosons. The model also predicts that the lightest right-handed Majorana neutrino, whose mass is about several hundred GeVs and energy is about 1016 GeV, is possibly a candidate for the dark matter.}

The interplay between electronic and vibronic interactions is examined. The electronic spectrum is shown to consist of two spin triplets 3T1 and 3T2 and three spin singlets 1A1, 1E and 1T2 levels determined by the double-transfer processes (parameter P). Jahn-Teller and pseudo-Jahn-Teller problems (3T1 + 3T2) ⊗ (e + t2) and (1A1 + 1E + 1T2) ⊗ (e + t2) have been considered in the framework of the Piepho-Krausz-Schatz model dealing with the only vibronic parameter. Several kinds of spatial electronic distribution have been found corresponding to the stable points of the energy surfaces. For spin-triplet states, potential surfaces contain six minima in e space corresponding to partially delocalized electronic pairs over four sides of the Td structure (limiting case of weak coupling), or delocalized over two opposite sides (limiting case of strong coupling). The former situation restricts electron delocalization to two of the three metal octahedra of each M3O12 triad in such a way that each electron moves over a tetrameric unit in which the metal sites are alternatively sharing edges and corners. In the t2 space the electronic pair can be either delocalized over three sides, giving rise to a trigonal-type distortion of the cluster and a partial electron delocalization over two opposite M3O12 triads (four trigonal minima in the case of strong transfer or relatively weak vibronic interaction), or be completely localized (case of strong vibronic coupling). For spin-singlet states the system possesses a stable point in the high-symmetrical nuclear configuration, corresponding to a full delocalization of the electronic pairs in the Keggin cluster. The influence of vibronic interaction on the nature of the spin of the ground states is considered.}

In this paper, we hypothesize that in a mature industry, the expertise that guides designers in this mapping process exists in the form of an engineering design-philosophy that governs the design of products in that industry. Clearly, if we are able to discern the design-philosophies that exist in an industry, they can then be used to channrl designers' creativity to be congruent with the commercial objectives of firms in that industry. Using real-world data from the automobile industry, we show the existence of design-philosophies and illustrate methodologies for identifying and interpreting them. We also describe predictive models that allow managers to exploit the knowledge available in these design-philosophies and accurately specify a new product's manufacturing attribute values, given market input regarding the product's desired features. This total approach should save firms valuable product designing time and enable them to generate products that can be successfully produced and sold.}

It is also clear that supply chain activities in mining operations may have severe environmental and social problems with serious economic consequences. Greening the supply chain of mining operations are an important avenue that can provide beneficial consequences. Developing, evaluating, assessing, and selecting essential green supply chain management (GSCM) practices are a goal for successful GSCM implementation. These practices may have interrelated and complex relationships. Understanding them and their relative importance is an initial step for achieving the assessment goals for successful GSCM implementation in the mining industry. This study adopts a proposed comprehensive and integrative GSCM major practices and sub-practices (framework); determines the relative relationships and influences within this GSCM framework, and identifies the perceived impact of the GSCM framework on organizational sustainable performance (economic, environmental, and social – triple bottom-line) pertinent to the mining industry, in the emerging economy nation of Ghana. An integrated methodology identifying and limiting interdependencies within GSCM factors will be utilized. The methodology uses fuzzy-DEMATEL and analytical network process (ANP) for the evaluation. Multiple field studies within Ghana's mining industry are used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The results can provide valuable clues and guidelines to decision-makers and analysts inside and outside the mining industry, for improving corporate sustainable production and consumption.

Companies are usually anchored to commercial ICT tools, which are mature and reliable. However, two main problems emerge: the difficulty in selecting the most suitable tools for specific purposes and the complexity in evaluating the impact that using technology has on design collaboration. The present work aims to face both aspects by proposing a structured benchmarking method based on expert judgements and defining a set of benchmarking weights based on experimental tests. The method considers both human–human interaction and teamwork-related aspects. A subsequent evaluation protocol considering both process efficiency and human–human interaction allows a closed-loop verification process. Pilot projects evaluate different technologies, and the benchmarking weights are verified and adjusted for more reliable system assessment. This paper focuses on synchronous and remote design review activities: three different tools have been compared according to expert judgements. The two best performing tools have been implemented as pilot projects within real industrial chains. Design collaboration has been assessed by considering both process performance and human–human interaction quality, as well as benchmarking results validated by indicating some corrective actions. The final benchmarking weights can thus be further adopted for an agile system benchmark in synchronous and remote design. The main findings suggest defining both an innovative process to verify the expert benchmark reliability and a trusty benchmarking method to evaluate tools for synchronous and remote design without experimental testing. Furthermore, the proposed method has a general validity and can be properly set for different collaborative dimensions.}

abstract = {A higher-order shear deformation theory of elastic shells is developed for shells laminated of orthotropic layers. The theory is a modification of the Sanders' theory and accounts for parabolic distribution of the transverse shear strains through thickness of the shell and tangential stress-free boundary conditions on the boundary surfaces of the shell. The Navier-type exact solutions for bending and natural vibration are presented for cylindrical and spherical shells under simply supported boundary conditions.}

abstract = {Considering multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems under uncertain environment, this paper presents a novel concept of intuitionistic fuzzy rough numbers (IFRNs), which is fused by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) and rough numbers (RNs), and proposes a new approach for MCGDM based on IFRNs. The proposed approach can aggregate group information and obtain the final decision results in an objective and effective way. First, we propose the constructing process of IFRNs and discuss the arithmetic operations, ranking rules, aggregation operators, as well as some corresponding properties. Then the novel concept of IFRN is used to aggregate intuitionistic fuzzy information given by decision group. Based on the aggregated IFRNs, the MABAC model is extended from two perspectives, obtaining an IFN-based MABAC model and an IFRN-based MABAC model respectively. Finally an empirical example of supplier selection for medical devices is utilized to show the application of proposed models, and comparisons with five traditional models, of which three refer to information aggregating and two refer to alternatives selecting, are made to validate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed methods.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 has received inordinate attention from the business as well as research communities. Along with the development of Industry 4.0 applications and the diversity of potential alternatives, Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques have been employed by researchers as systematic approaches to support the decision-making processes. However, as the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies requires considerable capital, and as it is relatively difficult to identify the suitable MADM method for the decision-making process in certain conditions, it becomes necessary to determine which components of Industry 4.0 are most commonly in demand of MADM applications of decision making, and which MADM techniques are mostly preferred by researchers and businesses for varied directions of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of MADM methods and their applications for different components of Industry 4.0. A methodology, including a review framework, is provided for the related analyses. The proposed framework includes analyses concerning methods, subtopics, and bibliometry along with the related exploratory tables and figures. Finally, the trends and research gaps are clearly stated to shed light on the further research areas taking into consideration different challenges that can be encountered by researchers, along with a set of propositions to potentially overcome them.}

Nonstereospecific addition of dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptenylidene could not be detected by carrying out the photolysis in a large excess of cyclohexane, or by photosensitized decomposition of 10. It is concluded that photolysis of 10 leads to a singlet (6) which converts to the triplet state and reacts stereospecically with olefins to form cyclopropanes. These stereochemical results were reasonably explained by considering that a charge transfer complex plays an important role in the transition state of the addition reaction of 6 to olefins. The electronic structures of these carbenes are discussed in the light of results obtained from ESR and optical spectroscopy.}

Distance measure is used to measure the deviation degree between different arguments. Since the existing distance measures between intuitionistic multiplicative sets cannot represent the angle of two intuitionistic multiplicative sets, this paper introduces some new distance measures between intuitionistic multiplicative sets, which include the projection-based distance measure and the psychological distance measures. After that, a multiple attribute group decision making method is proposed to handle the problem in which the weights of experts and attributes are unknown or partially known. A case study concerning the drug supplier selection in hospital management is provided to demonstrate the calculation process of the proposed method. Finally, some comparative analyses are given to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method.}
